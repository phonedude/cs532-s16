   There's no doubt that social media is one of the most effective ways to
   forge relationships online. However as most of us have probably
   experienced, it can also take up a whole lot of time. For this reason,
   I'm always on the lookout for social media tools that can help make my
   social media activities more efficient and more effective.

   Following are 9 social media tools that can enhance your social media
   efforts, as well as save you tons of time.  They make your life easier
   by allowing you to:
     * Integrate various social networks
     * Schedule your posts or post in bulk
     * Perform advanced conversation tracking
     * Easily find new content to share with your community
     * Manage your time spent on social media more effectively
     * Find new influencers to reach out to

   As always, please add to the discussion by letting me know your
   favorite tools at the end of this post!

   1.      [38]Tagboard

   tagboard


   Tagboard is one of my favorite social media tools for social media
   monitoring. It allows you to easily keep track of hashtags on major
   social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+ and
   Vine.

   It can be extremely difficult to monitor and track conversations
   happening across multiple platforms, and Tagboard saves you a ton of
   time by allowing you to create custom boards with content from each
   platform.

   2.      [39]Social Oomph

   social oomph

   If you are a high-frequency poster on social media, you will appreciate
   the benefits of using a service like Social Oomph. While there are
   other products that allow you to schedule social media posts, Social
   Oomph also allows you to save and re-use drafts, schedule posts in
   bulk, and submit social updates via email.

   It also offers advanced searches that allow you to easily find
   influential or relevant people to follow, and that will even alert you
   when certain keywords are used on Twitter.

   While not the fanciest-looking tool, it will undoubtedly save
   high-volume social media marketers loads of time over the long term.

   3.      [40]Hootsuite


   hootsuite

   You just knew Hootsuite had to be on here, right?

   Even if you opt for the free version of the platform, you will quickly
   experience such benefits as being able to manage multiple social media
   accounts in one place, and to schedule updates in advance. As a basic
   social media tool for small business owners, you just can't beat
   Hootsuite.

   And the good news is that if you do decide you need more functionality,
   like advanced reporting or team collaboration, the pro version of the
   platform is only about $9 per month.

   4.      [41]Social Mention

     social mention


   This is another great (free) tool for monitoring keywords and hashtags
   across multiple platforms. In fact, as it monitors over 100 social
   networking sites, it gives some of the most comprehensive social media
   keyword keyword research available.

   Some of the best features of the platform are its simplicity,
   ease-of-use, and the analytics it gives for specific keywords.
   Measuring influence in terms of strength, sentiment, passion and reach,
   it gives you a quick snapshot of the current status of a particular
   topic or phrase.

   5.      [42]Sprout Social

   social sprout


   As one of the most comprehensive social media solutions, Sprout Social
   is extremely robust and feature-rich. While there is no free version
   (apart from a 30 day free trial), a basic membership is only about $40
   per month. While this may seem like quite a bit more than other
   platforms (because it is), it does offer some unique features that many
   other services don't.

   One of the best features of Sprout Social is their customizable inbox.
   By allowing you to decide what comes into your inbox, and then
   reporting on how efficiently you're responding, you can make sure
   you're always on top of your most important messages and tasks.

   6.      [43]Google Alerts

     google alerts


   A simple tool, but one that can save you from running countless
   searches for mentions of your products, website or brand!

   Signing up for Google Alerts is free and easy, and ensures you never
   miss a brand mention again. You can select as many keywords as you
   like, and each time the word or phrase is used online, you'll receive a
   notification. This is a great way to track mentions not only of your
   own brand, but of your competition.

   7.      [44]Rescue Time

   rescue time


   If you ever worry that the amount of time you spend on social media may
   be, well...excessive, Rescue Time can help! By running in the
   background of your computer or mobile device, the software tracks
   exactly which websites or activities you are using, and how much time
   you are spending on each.

   For instance, do you have any idea how much time you spend on:
     * Email?
     * Facebook?
     * Twitter?
     * Hootsuite?
     * Randomly surfing the net?

   An added benefit of Rescue Time is that you can also set alerts to let
   you know when `time's up' for a particular activity!

   8.      [45]Swayy

     swayy


   If you ever struggle to find content to share with your community,
   you'll love Swayy. By finding the most important social media posts and
   dropping them right into your dashboard, you'll always have a steady
   stream of sharable content.

   The platform also allows you to easily share this content
   cross-platform with your audience. As you use the program more and
   more, it `learns' what types of content you enjoy, and most
   importantly, what types of content resonates the most with your
   community.

   No more searching through your social media posts for sharable
   content...just check your Swayy dashboard!

   9.[46] Inkybee

     inkybee


   We could all use more friends, right?

   Rather than randomly searching the web for new or influential blogs in
   your niche, Inkybee does all the hard word for you. Simply type in a
   keyword related to your niche, and the platform will return a list of
   the blogs that are most closely related.

   The best part is that rather than simply returning generic Google-like
   results, you receive stats on each blog, including audience, engagement
   levels, posts per week, and number of inbound links. This makes
   reaching out to influential bloggers in your niche a breeze!

   There are countless tools that did not make it onto this list, but
   these are a few of my favorites. As I hoped I have pointed out, working
   smarter, not just harder, is the best way to make the most efficient
   use of your time online!

   What's your favorite social media tool? How does it save you time?

       Thanks Kim for this helpful information.
       I am aware of Hootsuite, however, based on what I have read here, I
       think the last tool (Inkybee) is a more complete tool for both
       analytics, backlinks and monitoring competitor.
       My question is; is it a free or premium tool?

            Hi Dare, Inkybee is not free, but it does have a 30 day free
            trial and it is then deliberately very affordable for small
            businesses with monthly plans from only US$19/month. And you
            are right, in addition to finding the best bloggers, it does
            also have analytics on outreach performance.
            And to Kim: thanks so much for including Inkybee on this list
            :)

       There are some very useful tools on your list Kim. However, they
       aren't precisely the same when it comes to the data they provide,
       so it would be best to combine several and then use them to
       complement each other. For example, you can track mentions with
       Google Alert, but you still need a tool such as HootSuite to manage
       your social media accounts.

       Hi Kim. You really have put it all together here! I personally use
       a free app, Buffer, which has doubled my content productivity. My
       favourite feature is the "Connect with Buffer" that analyzes my
       times and every update added to go out at new optimized times for
       more clicks, likes and reach. Have you tried it before?

       looked to deep. I've been doing more social marketing, so it would
       probably be most helpful to use the right tools to help manage it.
       I am with Dany, I've only really used Google Alerts. Seems I heard
       that was changing though? Any one know?

       I'd like to add Mediatoolkit.com, a real-time media monitoring tool
       to the list. I use it every day and it has proven to be very
       reliable, crazy fast, and with a great balance between free
       features and paid subscription, which is more affordable than other
       tools I've tried.

       Dear Kim,
       This article is very useful for anyone who is in the online field
       and want to reach out to their fans & followers and keep them
       updated about the latest promotions irrespective of the platforms
       they are using. We usually have to reach out to large audience to
       let them know about the mobile recharge offers such as Paytm
       Coupons and Freecharge Coupons and this list of 9 tools you have
       provided is something we would like to refer to in future.
       Thanks

       Thanks Kim for this helpful information.
       I have been using Hootsuite for quite some while now and it has
       definitely saved me a lot of time. Some of my favorite tools which
       were not mentioned in this post are as follows
       IFTTT
       Canva
       Post Planner
       Not sure if you have had any experience working on these but you
       should definitely try them out.

       Cool apps, I've used hootsuite before and worked great. I'll have
       to try out the other ones on this list in the future. Thanks for
       the post!
