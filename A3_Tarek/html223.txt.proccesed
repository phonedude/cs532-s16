25 Secrets of People With Chronic Illnesses

   Elisabeth Brentano By [37]Elisabeth Brentano Feb 11, 2016
   This article discusses a[38]General topic in our community

   Nearly 133 million Americans have some sort of chronic illness, and
   that number is expected to [40]reach 157 million by 2020, according to
   data on the Invisible Illness Week website.

   From exhaustion to migraines to fatigue, many chronic illness symptoms
   aren't visible to the naked eye, which makes them even more difficult
   to diagnose -- and understand.

   With a growing number of people affected by chronic illnesses like
   [41]fibromyalgia, [42]arthritis, [43]Lyme disease, [44]Crohn's disease
   and [45]diabetes and more, it's important to both raise awareness and
   let others know how to respond to the needs of individuals living with
   these conditions.

   So we asked readers [46]in our Facebook community what [47]truths about
   chronic illness they wish others understood. Here's what they had to
   say:

   1. "Some days you can function, some you can't." --[48]Amber Wandmaker

   Woman on beach

   2. "I'm not lazy. I'm in pain, exhausted and quite possibly depressed
   because I feel useless and cannot make others understand what I go
   through on a daily basis." --[49]Jodie Farber Brubacher

   3. "It's not in my head." --[50]Christine Olson Smith

   Writing on notepad

   4. "When I'm pushing through... I'm really pushing myself too hard."
   --[51]Debra Declue

   5. "Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not real."
   --[52]Rhonda Miller-Solomon

   Magnifying glass, close-up, cropped

   6. "Accepting the fact that I will never get better is what has allowed
   me to live my life and continue to work towards my goals without
   waiting to `get better.'" --[53]Joan Elizabeth

   7. "A good day for people with chronic pain... is often just `less of a
   bad day.'" --[54]Ann Webb Bradford

   8. "Being immune compromised/suppressed isn't a game; it's dangerous.
   When I say I can't get sick, I'm not being paranoid; I'm being careful.
   Life's no good when you're dead!" --[55]Arianna Nyswonger

   9. "I've become an expert on hiding my pain from everyone." --[56]Beth
   Cox Harrell

   Woman looking through blinds

   10. "Chronic illness often comes in multiple versions; treating one can
   mean making another one worse." --[57]Zoann Murphy

   11. "I can't remember what `well' feels like." --[58]Sandra Williams

   12. "Good can change to bad in a matter of minutes. There are good days
   and bad days, but there are also good hours and bad hours, good minutes
   and bad minutes. Chronic illness does not see or understand time."
   --[59]Deanna Guarino-Embry

   Clock on wall

   13. "There's no such thing as `too young;' we can't just show out
   bodies ID and tell the illness to come back in 10-20 years!" --[60]Jen
   Andrew

   14. "It doesn't get better. It is this way. Every day. Forever. If
   you're in my life, please don't ask me if I'm feeling `better' today."
   --[61]Wendy Rose

   Old man feeling sick

   15. "We shouldn't be treated like drug addicts or hypochondriacs and
   denied the care we truly need." --[62]Amy Brandborg

   16. "I live a double life. What you see when I am at work: someone who
   is well put together, always dependable, smiling, will always tell you
   she is doing fine. My reality: I'm a mess, in so much pain, my smiles
   are forced, sometimes I have to find a quiet place to cry. But it's
   much easier for me to fake it because coworkers don't want to hear my
   truth day after day." --[63]Amber Weller

   Woman in front of mirror

   17. "A `good attitude' doesn't take away pain or improve mobility. I am
   still human and I will have days when I just can't drum up that `good
   attitude.'" --[64]Vicki Gomes Petilli

   Woman standing in field barefoot

   18. "I didn't do this to myself. I didn't not pray hard enough or
   believe hard enough. I didn't not eat well enough or not exercise
   enough." --[65]Barb Silvestro

   19. "It hurts to be forgotten because we have said no to so many
   events, parties, family gatherings, shopping trips, etc. I want them to
   still ask just so I know they are still thinking of me." --[66]Victoria
   Sinclair

   Upset woman with grey hair

   20. "There is no magic cure. I don't want to be sick, but this is my
   reality. I can't wish it away or cleanse it away or take supplements
   because your sister's boyfriend's mother did." --[67]Christina
   Marroquin-Mauricio

   Spoon with heart in it

   21. "People don't choose to feel horrible every day and lose the person
   they used to be." -[68]Caitlin Hoechst

   22. "What I can do one day I might not be able to do the next."
   --[69]Becky Rider

   23. "I'm not making it up. If I wanted to fake an illness, I would
   choose something that people would believe!" --[70]Faith Merryn

   Upset man

   24. "My downtime doesn't mean I'm depressed or isolating. It's a time
   for me to heal and recharge." --[71]Kate Wilhelmi

   25. "My illness does not define me, my dreams or who I am!" --[72]Judy
   Fox Berryan

   Woman on the beach
