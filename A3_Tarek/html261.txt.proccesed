Woman's dead body sat in parking lot for months

Body found inside car left outside Walmart

   MARINA, Calif. - The body of a missing woman was found inside a car
   that had been sitting in a Walmart parking lot for three months.

   [142]KSBW says that Lauren Moss had gone missing on Nov. 13, 2015 after
   she left a rehab center.

   It wasn't until Feb. 3 that Moss' body was found by Walmart employees
   inside a Volkswagen Jetta in the parking lot.

   Surveillance cameras that only went back to Dec. 2015 showed that the
   car had been in the same parking spot the entire time.

   Police say that since the car had dark-tinted windows and a sunshade
   above the dashboard, it would have been difficult to see Moss' body
   inside.

   It's believed that Moss committed suicide as a suicide note was left
   for her family and a drug needle was found inside the car.
