Eagles' Bennie Logan was one of the NFL's best run-stuffers in 2015

   The 2016 NFL offseason has begun for the [75]Philadelphia Eagles, which
   means Howie Roseman and new head coach Doug Pederson will spend the
   next couple of weeks evaluating the 2015 roster. The team went 7-9 last
   season and improvement is clearly needed. By the time NFL free agency
   starts on March 9, the Eagles will have a good idea of which players
   they'll want to bring back for the 2016 season. Today we'll continue
   this offseason review series by looking at the nose tackle position.

The Players

   BENNIE LOGAN

   Numbers: 598 snaps, 1 sack, 1 hit, 11 hurries, 39 tackles

   Review: Remember when some thought Logan was too small to play nose
   tackle? He disproved that once again in 2015 by having a beastly
   season. Logan finished finished in tackles among 3-4 nose tackles and
   4-3 defensive tackles. He ranked second overall in "Run Stop
   Percentage," which is a Pro Football Focus signature stat that
   essentially tries to gauge meaningful tackles. So not just tackles
   where an offensive player runs through a defense and a guy finally
   brings him down, but instead a tackle where the defender made a good
   play. In other words, Logan was a run-stuffing force.

     Bennie Logan > La'el Collins [78]https://t.co/98MKrGzv5w
     -- Brandon Lee Gowton (@BrandonGowton) [79]February 11, 2016

   Logan's value to the team was apparent. Philadelphia's run defense was
   the best in the league early in the season before[80] Logan got hurt
   and it completely fell apart. Many attribute the Eagles' defensive
   decline to the [81]amount of snaps played and the loss of impressive
   rookie Jordan Hicks. Those were definitely significant factors, but so
   was losing Logan.

   In the Eagles' old 3-4 two-gap scheme, Logan was required to read and
   react. He was very good at doing that, but it didn't free him up to
   make plays as a pass rusher. In Philadelphia's new 4-3 scheme, Logan
   will have the chance to attack. The combination of him and Cox as 4-3
   defensive tackles should make for a very strong interior defensive
   line.

   BEAU ALLEN

   Numbers: 349 snaps, 18 tackles, 2 pass deflections

   Review: Allen was the primary backup to Logan. He didn't really stand
   out in a positive way last season. As I mentioned earlier, the run
   defense declined when he was in and Logan was out. He might be a fine
   backup player but he didn't show enough to be a good starter.

Who Could Leave

   Logan had never played in a 3-4 before joining the Eagles in 2013.
   Allen, meanwhile, played in a 4-3 defense three out of his four seasons
   with Wisconsin. One would think these players should be able to handle
   Philadelphia's scheme change.

Who Could Sign

   The Eagles' starting defensive tackles will likely be Logan and
   Fletcher Cox. The depth behind them could be light so they'll need to
   fill out the roster at that spot. [82]Nick Fairley has already been
   suggested. This is a spot where the Eagles could look to add a veteran
   backup.

[83]NFL Draft Options

   Copying and pasting what I wrote before: "There are a number of
   intriguing interior defensive line prospects in this draft, including
   A'Shawn Robinson, Robert Nkemdiche, and Andrew Billings. The Eagles
   have young and talent on the inside so they certainly don't need to
   force a pick. They could afford to draft some depth, though."
