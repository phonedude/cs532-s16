Video: UCLA Gymnast Sophina DeJesus Whips, Nae Naes And Slays

   Updated February 11, 20168:52 AM ET Published February 10, 20165:03 PM

   In 1996, when Dominque Dawes became the first black woman to win an
   individual gymnastics medal at the Atlanta Summer Olympics, critics
   said [236]her look wasn't quite right.

   In 2012, Gabby Douglas became the first black woman to win the title of
   individual all-around champion at the London Summer Olympics. She was
   then asked again and again to comment on [237]critiques about her hair.

   In 2013, Simone Biles became the first black woman to be world
   all-around champion at the gymnastics World Championship. Following her
   win, [238]Italian Gymnastics Federation official David Ciaralli said
   there was "a trend in gymnastics at this moment, which is going towards
   a technique that opens up new chances to athletes of colour (well-known
   for power) while penalising the more artistic Eastern European style
   that allowed Russians and Romanians to dominate the sport for years."
   Ciarelli also said black people were [239]unsuited to be field
   managers, general managers, or swimmers.

   Black female athletes, especially the ones who make it to the very top,
   have faced a history of being criticized for their bodies, their hair
   and their strength. In performative sports, like gymnastics, figure
   skating and ballet, they're often subject to more elusive critiques
   about style and grace. The exact meaning of these comments can be hard
   to pin down, but they still send a clear message: This is not a black
   woman's sport. Black women don't belong here.

   Which is part of what makes a video that went viral this weekend so
   exciting. It shows a young woman named Sophina DeJesus, [240]a senior
   on the gymnastics team at UCLA who [241]identifies as African-American
   and Puerto Rican, incorporating dance moves into her Saturday floor
   routine that are strongly rooted in blackness.

   She whips, nae naes, and hits the quan while also expertly landing
   difficult tumbling sequences. The routine earned her a 9.925 from the
   judges, but the crowd was screaming for a 10. On Facebook, [242]the
   video has been watched over 26 million times.

     how can you not love black ppl? we lit ее [243]#BlackHistoryMonth
     [244]#BlackExcellence [245]https://t.co/Z7p7dc2mdg
     -- 7 GOD (@iiBreakNecks) [246]February 9, 2016

   DeJesus' routine doesn't show an athlete dominating at a traditionally
   white sport despite her race. It was an athlete celebrating her race in
   the context of a traditionally white sport. In under two minutes,
   DeJesus -- blue hair, hip-hop beats and all -- showed that black bodies
   and black culture belong in gymnastics.

   Nevertheless, that sensibility probably won't carry over to
   higher-level competitions, at least for now. In an [247]interview with
   the New York Times, former Olympic silver medalist and Bruin Samantha
   Peszek said that "international judges seem to appreciate more
   traditional style of floor choreography" and that the strict Olympic
   requirements don't allow much room for "elaborate choreography."

   But that doesn't mean you won't be able to get your fix of
   hip-hop-infused backflips. DeJesus' UCLA team competes again on Feb. 13
   and [248]every weekend after that until mid-April.

   our lives and communities, and how all of this is shifting. Sit with us
   a bit.
