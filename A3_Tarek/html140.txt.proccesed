Research scope The Deloitte Millennial Survey 2016

   Insights

The Deloitte Millennial Survey 2015

   Deloitte's fourth annual Millennial Survey revealed that Generation Y
   wants to work for businesses that focus on people and purpose, not just
   products and profits in the 21st century.

   Insights

Millennials' economic outlook: Storms ahead for emerging markets

   Millennials provide a useful barometer of economic confidence and their
   current view of future performance is both striking and concerning.

   Analysis

Flexible working: Striking a balance

   The 2016 Millennial Survey found that while most respondents were able
   to access email and relevant applications from mobile devices--and
   also, within limits, work flexible hours--only a minority were allowed
   to work from home or other locations where they felt most productive.

The Deloitte Millennial Survey 2016

Winning over the next generation of leaders

   Two-thirds of Millennials express a desire to leave their organizations
   by 2020. Businesses must adjust how they nurture loyalty among
   Millennials or risk losing a large percentage of their workforces.

Executive summary

   Millennials, in general, express little loyalty to their current
   employers and many are planning near-term exits, according to Deloitte
   Touche Tohmatsu Limited's fifth annual Millennial Survey. This
   remarkable absence of allegiance represents a serious challenge to any
   business employing a large number of Millennials, especially those in
   markets--like the United States--where Millennials now represent the
   largest segment of the workforce. However, because most young
   professionals choose organizations that share their personal values,
   it's not too late for employers to overcome this "loyalty challenge."
   Deloitte surveyed nearly 7,700 Millennials from 29 countries during
   September and October 2015 to learn more about Millennials' values and
   ambitions, drivers of job satisfaction, and their increasing
   representation in senior management teams.

[35]Millennials have one foot out the door

   Forty-four percent of Millennials say, if given the choice, they would
   like to leave their current employers in the next two years. A
   perceived lack of leadership-skill development and feelings of being
   overlooked are compounded by larger issues around work/life balance,
   the desire for flexibility, and a conflict of values.

[39]Millennials' values do not change as they progress professionally

   Millennials appear to be steered by strong values at all stages of
   their careers; it's apparent in the employers they choose, the
   assignments they're willing to accept, and the decisions they make as
   they take on more senior-level roles.

[43]Millennials want business to shift its purpose

   While they continue to express a positive view of business' role in
   society and have softened their negative perceptions of business'
   motivation and ethics compared to prior surveys, Millennials still want
   businesses to focus more on people (employees, customers, and society),
   products, and purpose--and less on profits.

[49]It's not too late to earn Millennials' loyalty

   Millennials seek employers with similar values; seven in 10 believe
   their personal values are shared by the organizations for which they
   work. This is the potential "silver lining" for organizations aiming to
   retain these young professionals.
