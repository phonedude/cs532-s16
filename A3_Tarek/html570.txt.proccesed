Scientists have finally proven Einstein's century-old theory about
gravitational waves

   They picked up signals from two black holes merging light-years away

   Scientists say they have proven the existence of gravitational waves --
   the ripples in space-time that stem from objects moving throughout the
   Universe. If true, it's the first time these waves have been measured
   directly and marks one of the biggest scientific discoveries in
   decades. But there have been a few false alarms before.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "If true, it marks one of the biggest scientific discoveries in
   decades"

   The discovery was made by the large group of researchers who make up
   the [241]Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)
   Scientific Collaboration. The LIGO observatories picked up the wave
   signals on September 14th, 2015, coming from two distant black holes
   merging 1.3 billion years ago. The black holes spun around each other
   several times per second before merging in a massive explosion -- a
   process that generates huge gravitational waves. These waves peter out
   on the way to Earth, requiring delicate instrumentation that must
   adjust for any interference on our planet. Though LIGO's observations
   are ground-breaking, other scientists will need to pore over the data
   to make sure it's correct. The study was published [242]today in
   Physical Review Letters. There will also be more studies in the coming
   weeks and months.

   Gravitational waves were predicted by Albert Einstein in 1918, as part
   of his theory of general relativity. Finding them would confirm a big
   part of that theory -- and would also be the first step toward a new
   way of observing the cosmos. Black holes and neutron stars are too dim
   to be seen by modern telescopes, but researchers might be able to
   measure the gravitational waves they produce. That would tell
   scientists more information about how these objects manipulate gravity,
   and may even lead to the discovery of new objects and concepts we've
   never even thought about. "It's not just that we're checking on a
   theory," says Ira Thorpe, an astrophysicist at NASA, who was not
   involved with LIGO. "The real important part of this is it gives us a
   completely new tool for understanding our Universe."

   That is, assuming today's finding is right. Scientists have been wrong
   about gravitational waves a few times before. In the 1960s, American
   physicist Joseph Weber claimed he had detected gravitational waves, but
   his findings were discredited when no one could reproduce them. And in
   2014, a team using the BICEP2 telescope near the South Pole said they
   had found evidence of the waves by studying the early Universe; their
   results, however, [244]turned out to be from cosmic dust. The tools
   that LIGO uses are very susceptible to outside interference, which
   means that today's results could be influenced by interference
   generated here on Earth.

   "Scientists have been wrong about gravitational waves before"

   But for now, today is a day of celebration for scientists. "Ladies and
   gentlemen, we have detected gravitational waves. We did it," said David
   Reitze, the LIGO executive director, at the press conference announcing
   the discovery. His declaration was met by cheers and applause by the
   scientists and press in attendance. "The things we've surmised and
   speculated about will become the subjects of detailed study," Marc
   Kamionkowski, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University, told
   The Verge before the announcement. "It's just amazing that they can
   detect this."

What are gravitational waves?

   Einstein's theory of general relativity completely altered how we
   perceive the Universe. Originally, scientists thought that space and
   time were two fixed and independent concepts. But Einstein's theory
   combined space and time together into one four-dimensional model called
   space-time. And space-time isn't fixed at all.

   "Einstein's theory completely altered how we perceive the Universe"

   The theory also altered our understanding of gravity. According to
   Newtonian physics, all objects in the Universe are innately attracted
   to one another. Einstein instead proposed that objects actually warp
   the space-time around them, creating gravitational "pull." Imagine a
   bowling ball on top of a stretched blanket. The ball bends the blanket,
   creating an impression in the fabric. Planets and stars are the bowling
   ball; space-time is the blanket. Now, imagine rolling a marble across
   that blanket with the bowling ball on it. The marble is going to follow
   the curve of the blanket down toward the ball. Smaller objects like
   asteroids act like the marble when near a bigger mass: they following
   the curvature of space-time the larger object creates.

   When objects move through the Universe, they also warp space-time as
   they go. This causes ripples: gravitational waves. The movement of
   every object -- from a person to a supermassive black hole -- produces
   gravitational waves.

   "Gravitational waves are usually incredibly weak"

   Most everyone in the scientific community believe gravitational waves
   exist, but no one has ever proved it. That's because the signals from
   gravitational waves are usually incredibly weak. "When we move, the
   gravitational wave is so weak it is effectively zero," says
   Kamionkowski. "The Earth going around the Sun produces a gravitational
   wave signal, but it is still very, very weak."

   But the more mass an object has, the bigger the wave it produces.
   Super-dense objects like black holes or neutron stars moving at rapid
   speeds can produce big enough gravitational waves that can be measured
   here on Earth. So that's what LIGO's scientists targeted.

LIGO

   The LIGO collaboration has two observatories in Louisiana and
   Washington State, both funded by the National Science Foundation. Each
   facility is shaped like a giant "L;" the "arms" of the L are two
   vacuum-sealed tubes stretching 2.5 miles long, with mirrors at each
   end. The mirrors are used to measure how gravitational waves warp
   space-time. When a gravitational wave passes, one mirror gets closer
   while the other retreats; scientists measure this phenomenon by
   bouncing lasers off the mirrors. Changes in the amount of time it takes
   a laser to bounce off a mirror indicate a gravitational wave.

   The gravitational wave measurements from the black holes were also
   converted into audible form, what LIGO calls a "chirp." Right as the
   black holes merge, the frequency of the resulting gravitational waves
   increases up until the moment of collision. As a sound, that movement
   becomes a high-pitched note that raises octaves really quickly. The
   chirp is perceptible in the recording below. Scientists shifted its
   frequency so it's easier to hear.

   The gravitational waves only change LIGO's instruments by about one
   ten-thousandth the size of a proton. This means Earth isn't the ideal
   place to look for waves, since movements from people or traffic can
   potentially cause interference. For instance, LIGO kept getting
   "readings" that were actually the result of cars rolling over a nearby
   bump in the road.

   But LIGO has tried to adjust for possible interferences. The
   collaboration even has three members dedicated to messing with the
   data. These scientists purposefully create fake signals to make sure
   the collaboration can discern what real measurements are supposed to
   look like. At one point, [246]LIGO was ready to announce they had
   detected gravitational waves based on one of these fake readings. The
   team had to start all over again when they found out the data had been
   manipulated.

Moving forward

   space could look like. (NASA)

   If LIGO's measurements hold up, the collaboration could start its own
   ripple effect -- one within the scientific community. Gravitational
   waves offer ways to study objects that don't give off light -- which
   could mean more research institutions might invest in ways to detect
   them. "When radio telescopes were first discovered, we found all these
   powerful radio sources we'd never known before," says Kamionkowski.
   "We're getting new eyes to look at the sky."

   "Gravitational wave detection could move beyond Earth into space"

   Likely, gravitational wave detection will move beyond Earth into space.
   Thorpe is currently working on the [247]LISA Pathfinder mission, a
   partnership between NASA and the European Space Agency. The project
   launched a spacecraft in December to test the technologies needed for
   future space-based gravitational wave detectors. Thorpe says that by
   working in space, the disturbances associated with Earth aren't a
   problem. Also, there's a lot more room to work with: a space detector
   could use laser beams millions of miles long to pick up gravitational
   wave movements. "By going to space, we can really take advantage of the
   fact that we can make our detector bigger," he says.

   Realistically, though, such technologies are decades away. But Thorpe
   says today's discovery will help spur efforts like the LISA Pathfinder
   mission. "The success of a project like LIGO will inspire us to keep
   going and trying."
