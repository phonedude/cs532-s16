   February 11, 2016

   Like most people I know, I've been an avid Facebook and LinkedIn user
   for years. But there was one platform I never appreciated
   much: Twitter. I'm not sure why, but I never connected with Twitter
   -- until now.

   I recently started using the platform, and I now think it's just plain
   awesome. In addition to the hours of mental stimulation it can provide,
   it's a great tool for entrepreneurs to aid the growth of their
   businesses.

   Here are just a few things to love about Twitter:

1. Never-ending, digestible information

   Twitter is a gateway to a massive amount of information. Opinions,
   news, videos, photos and more are readily available from millions of
   people and organizations around the world. The information is endless.
   In fact, 63 percent of Twitter users [40]surveyed by Pew Research in
   2015 said they read news on the platform.

   Although Twitter is home to a never-ending stream of content, it
   doesn't have to be overwhelming -- in fact it can be quite digestible.
   The platform is easy to navigate and search for hashtags, trending
   topics, handles or newsfeed.

2. Real-time updates

   Twitter showcases the most recent and relevant events as they happen.
   It's as real-time as social media gets. As situations unfold, users can
   see the thoughts and feelings of individuals at that moment.

   For example, I followed [41]#blizzard2016nyc as New York's recent
   snowstorm raged on. I saw pictures, read first-hand information about
   conditions and learned when it was safe to venture out.

   You can also monitor hashtags for industry conferences and events,
   campaigns and product rollouts or stay current on relevant topics to
   post about and discuss with followers. On the Internet, relevancy is
   everything, and Twitter empowers entrepreneurs with real-time updates
   to stay in the know.

3. Access to hard-to-reach people

   Twitter is the great equalizer platform. Presidential candidates,
   celebrities, artists, leaders and other prominent figures are active on
   Twitter and many of them engage with their followers on a regular
   basis. For example, Taylor Swift is well-known for engaging
   significantly with her Twitter fans, even surprise-visiting them at
   their houses!

   Contacting mentors or role models for advice, asking founders for their
   opinions on industry news and events and getting influencers to share
   product information and reviews are all now possible with Twitter.

4. New connections

   Twitter, like other social networks, opens the door to new connections.
   But Twitter is more open than Facebook and LinkedIn, making it easier
   to find new people and build relationships with them.

   Entrepreneurs can find new clients, colleagues, mentors or their next
   superstar employee. In fact, 47 percent of recruiters [43]surveyed by
   Jobvite in 2015 said they used Twitter to find talent.

   However small, relationships started on Twitter can impact your
   business and its growth.

   platform in the comments below!
