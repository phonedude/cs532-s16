Scientists ecstatic on social media after the discovery of
#GravitationalWaves

   Scientists around the world expressed their joy on social media after
   researchers in the US announced they had discovered gravitational
   waves. Predicted by Einstein a century ago, they had never been
   observed before.
   [181]USA LIGO Livingston Forschungszentrum

   Scientists in the US on Thursday held a press conference
   [182]announcing the discovery of gravitational waves, a phenomenon
   first described 100 years ago by German physcist Albert Einstein in his
   theory of General Relativity.

   The discovery is the result of an experiment by the Laser
   Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory(LIGO), whose Executive
   Director David Reitze was the first to break the news at an event
   broadcast live on Youtube:

   LIGO`s experiment was meant to spot the shock waves produced by the
   collision of two black holes at the speed of light, a cosmic phenomenon
   of gigantic magnitude thought to cause ripples in the fabric of space,
   and which has never been effectively measured since it was
   [183]theorized by Einstein.

   Echoed by scientists across social media, the news had many science
   enthusiasts, as well as professional physicists and astronomers,
   excited even before the official announcement.

     Possibly the biggest day for physics in the past decade! [184]#LIGO
     -- Michael T (@Michael_Tolan_) [185]February 11, 2016

   #tweet.697704739761491968#

   There had been wide speculation online before the official press
   conference since an email seemingly showing a LIGO researcher sharing
   positive results was leaked last month, leading many to speculate about
   a possible announcement.

   LIGO said the discovery was in fact made on September 14, 2015, after
   two of the participating laboratories confirmed they had the same
   readings.

     observatories.
     -- LIGO (@LIGO) [190]February 11, 2016

   Upon hearing the news, scientists around the globe expressed their joy
   and astonishment at what many have described as the start of a new
   approach to the study of the universe.

     This is a historic moment. And the wonderful thing about 21st
     century science: the whole word gets to share it. [191]#FeeltheChirp

     -- Bryan Gaensler (@SciBry) [193]February 11, 2016

     This is all making me surprisingly emotional. This is a Really Big
     Deal. It will change how we see the Universe.

     Applause ringing around [196]@uva_api. BRAVO [197]@LIGO!
     -- Anna Watts (@drannawatts) [198]February 11, 2016

   Many scientists also used the occasion to pay tribute to Albert
   Einstein, whom many say has been vindicated after almost a century of
   research.

     Gravitational waves discovered. So will Einstein get another Nobel?
     -- Craig Sparks (@chongsparks) [202]February 11, 2016

   Other members of the scientific community saluted their colleagues at
   LIGO and celebrated the discovery by filming themselves doing the
   "chirp" sound that characterized the measurements of the observatory's
   research, serving as the strongest evidence for the existence of the
   waves.

   Many were tweeting their videos using the hashtag #chirpForLIGO.

   There was excitement among uninitiated users as well, though many were
   still left wondering what the [209]real significance of the discovery
   truly was.
