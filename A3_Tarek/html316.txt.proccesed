Event Details

   February 2016 Event: Peter Biggs, Chief Executive, The Assignment Group


   IABC Wellington's opening event of 2016 will provide the opportunity to
   hear from one of Australasia's leading marketing and communications
   practitioners - Peter Biggs.

   He discusses his approach to successful communications; `Doing - not
   saying: Being distinctive in a flat world.'

   In a hyper-wired, connected and competitive world, how do brands and
   organisations stand out and succeed? Peter Biggs, Chief Executive of
   Assignment Group in New Zealand and Chair of the Wellington Regional
   Economic Development Agency, shares his perspective, provides some
   answers - and poses further questions.

   Peter's presentation will be preceded by a brief chapter AGM that will
   include introduction of the 2016 IABC Wellington board and a
   President's report.

   We look forward to seeing you there.
