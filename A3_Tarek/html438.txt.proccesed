   Titanic wasn't filmed at Texas Tech. Last night it could've been.
   Here's how it would've gone down.

     Currently at Texas Tech University... [75]pic.twitter.com/xLgF2mFV89
     -- Amanda Robins (@AmandaRobinss) [76]February 11, 2016

   Inspired by this video

   SCENE: The Deck

   A young Patrick Mahomes runs up to the railing of the boat as the new
   quarterback at Texas Tech University. His friend, Jakeem Grant is with
   him.

   Pat taps Jakeem on the shoulder to look into the water.

   PAT: "Hey looklooklook! look look!"

   BOTH look down as a JAYHAWK flies over the water

   JAKEEM: "What the heck is that?"

   PAT: "I don't know but it sure sucks at football"

   ...

   PAT: "Look at that one! Look how many there are!"

   JAKEEM: "Looks like they're all transferring"

   ...

   JAKEEM: "I can see the Big XII Trophy from here! It's very small of
   course."

   PAT: "I'M THE KING OF THE WOOOOOORLD"

   JAKEEM: "Pat get down you'll fall and die"

   SCENE: Deck

   ENTER: Kliff Kingsbury

   KLIFF: "Hello, Pat. I changed my mind."

   PAT: "shhhh. Give me your hand."

   PAT: "Now close your eyes. Go on."

   PAT: "Step up, and hold on to the railing. Keep your eyes closed, don't
   peek"

   KLIFF: "I'm not"

   PAT: "I'm gonna lead us to glory. Do you trust me?"

   KLIFF stretches out arms and lets PAT take control

   KLIFF: "I'm Air Raiding!"

   PAT begins beatboxing "Mobbin'" by Grandtheft into Kliff's ear

   KLIFF: "Hey can I come down this is getting weird"

   SCENE: Lifeboats

   The OFFENSIVE LINE has been destroyed. Kliff and Pat share one last
   moment before Pat is thrown to the iceberg of LSU.

   KLIFF jumps back onto the TITANIC

   PAT: "KLIFF! KLIFF WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

   PAT: "You're so stupid, Kliff! Why'd you do that?"

   KLIFF: "You jump, I jump, right?"

   KLIFF: "I couldn't go Pat! I love Texas Tech"

   PAT: "what were we talking about"

   KEVIN SUMLIN looks on, furious he was unable to get KLIFF back.

   SCENE: Broken Door In The Middle Of The Freezing Ocean

   KLIFF: "Pat! There's an OL croot, Pat! You're gonna be okay!"

   PAT is unresponsive

   OL CROOT commits to UT

   KLIFF: (weakly) "Come back! Come back!"

   PAT slips down into the abyss

   KLIFF: "I'll never let go Pat. I'll never let go"
