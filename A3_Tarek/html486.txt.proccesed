There's a Surprising Difference Between Republicans' and Democrats' Sex Lives

   Just in time for presidential primary season, here's a question: Does
   your political affiliation have anything to do with your sex life?

   According to data released by dating app [11]Clover, it just might.

   After surveying 700,000 of its users on their political affiliations
   and romantic histories, the app found that Republicans and Democrats
   are likely to have drastically different sexual proclivities. Insert
   some kind of bipartisan/bisexual joke here!

   "Since Valentine's Day is just around the corner and we're in the
   middle of the presidential primaries, we thought it would be fun to see
   if we could dig up some data that might help singles find a date who
   share their political views," Clover wrote in a press release sent to
   Mic. "This guide should also help those considering crossing the party
   line just to sleep with the enemy."

   According to the app's data, Democrats are twice as likely as
   Republicans to be into smoking weed and are 30% more likely to have
   casual sex, none of which is super surprising. Also unsurprising is the
   fact that the Republicans surveyed were twice as likely to have shot a
   gun than Democrats, as well as 200% more religious and 55% more into
   country music.

   But now for the juicy lil' plot twist!

   "Republicans have sex outdoors 50% more than Democrats," the press
   release says.

   Those animals.

   Given the finding that Republicans statistically are into religion and
   country music, it kinda makes sense that they'd be prone to getting
   frisky in the wild. If you're growing up in a [16]strict religious
   household, why would you risk getting caught boning in the bedroom when
   you could just play it safe and run two miles into the woods for a
   secluded, rustic rendezvous?

   Meanwhile, country music is all about doing shit in [17]fields and
   under the glow of the [18]moonlight. "Only the truck and the trees
   gonna see what we do," pop-country starlet [19]Kelsea Ballerini coos on
   her 2015 slow jam "[20]Looking at Stars," which is all about driving
   out to a remote creek and getting it on.

   The idea of doing it outside isn't exactly the most appealing when you
   think about stuff like insects or extreme temperatures (or if you
   happen to be in the mountains, [21]wild moose). But previous data has
   indicated that the discrepancy between Republican and Democrat sexual
   tastes might be part of a wider trend; in fact, conservatives might be
   having more fun in bed than liberals might expect.

   A Match.com[22] study done this month about the sex lives and political
   leanings found that Trump supporters in particular were "99% more
   likely than [Hillary] Clinton fans to have a sex tape of themselves,
   and 1,104% more likely to expect 'sexual contact' on a first
   date," [23]Refinery29 reported. Plus! A 2012 [24]study found that all
   this sexual contact has a not-too-shabby orgasm rate, with over 50% of
   Republicans reporting that they climax almost every time during sex, as
   compared to 40% of Democrats who said the same.

   Coincidence? Probably. But if you've been having difficulty hitting
   your [25]multi-orgasmic goals lately, maybe take a walk on the wild
   side this Valentine's Day weekend and do it in the dirt. Ya never know!
