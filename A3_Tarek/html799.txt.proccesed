Principles learned from the Mars Pathfinder mission.

   Adapted from the book, "The Mars Pathfinder Approach to
   Faster-Better-Cheaper" (Pritchett and Muirhead,1998).

Plan....and improvise.

   Some of the author's comments: "In your own pursuit of spectacular
   results, start out by doing some "deep planning." Anticipate as best
   you can. Make your very best guess about how the situation will unfold.

   "You should understand right now that your planning is doomed in
   certain respects. Don't expect to cover all contingencies, no matter
   how thorough you've been. It's been said that, `No plan survives
   contact with the enemy.' A key benefit of good planning is that it
   mentally prepares you to improvise."

   Even though I plan out my days pretty well, my schedules don't always
   follow the script. Perhaps a particular project doesn't come through or
   another doesn't go according to our original plans. So I have to
   improvise. It usually involves more marketing to try to bring in new
   business and otherwise use that extra time productively.

   What about you? To what extent do your plans go according to schedule,
   and how often do you have to improvise? What do you do? Please feel
   free to comment below. I'm interested in reading about your experiences
   and techniques you use to adapt to the ever-changing environment.

   You can read the third column in this series, "Deliberately choose to
   do things differently," [18]here.
