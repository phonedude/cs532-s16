changers


   One Thing Logo

   The ONE THING is an exclusive online series of interviews hosted by TV
   Business Expert, #1 Bestselling Author and renowned Strategic Alliances
   Expert Marsha Wright, and delivered to subscribers via email
   bi-monthly.

   The series delivers unique and poignant insights that add tremendous
   value to our extensive global audience; and is now available to the
   public for the first time ever, and each interview is promoted to over
   2 million people.

What Makes ONE THING Unique?

   Hundreds of hours are spent finding the most interesting interviews
   from the eight who are annually interviewed. Then, with hundreds of
   hours of research, our team pours over interviews, articles and
   literally scores of prior interviews to discover what's already in the
   public domain.

   Only now, are we ready to prepare for the ONE THING.

   The iconic guest is NEVER asked a question they have encountered in an
   interview before. For once they are challenged to hang up the canned
   answers and share deep and meaningful insights.

For YOU, our listeners, it makes for 60 minutes of the most riveting insights
you will ever hear.

   In addition the uniqueness of the interviews hinge upon Our delving
   DEEP into one topic; and that topic is: the ONE THING that if they
   could share with the world, or with one individual-would be the single
   most important thing that someone could live on for the rest of their
   lives.
