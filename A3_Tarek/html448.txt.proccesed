Top Travel Bloggers We Love

Our Top Travel Bloggers We Love

   There are literally hundreds of travel blogs out there to read, and
   it's almost impossible to choose your favourite. The list below are the
   top travel bloggers we enjoy reading the most and also who inspire us
   to travel more. Each one of these blogs have helped us in some way,
   from direct travel tips to inspiration through posts on their blog.

   [48]Wandering On Travel

   We stumbled upon Wandering On Travel while searching for information on
   Nepal. The blog, ran by Irish couple Brian and Noelle has an abundance
   of information on many destinations worldwide. Our favourite part of
   the blog is the [49]Nepal section, they have trekked to Everest and
   Annapurna base camp (jealous) but hoping to achieve this ourselves,
   thanks to a few tips from them in a recent chat on Twitter. Also if you
   subscribe to their blog you get a brilliant free photography ebook
   called `Faces of Nepal'.

   [50]Goats on the Road

   As a travelling couple ourselves, Goats on the Road have been the most
   inspiring blog for us for our travel plans and starting our own blog.
   Canadian couple Nick and Dariece have been on the road since 2008 and
   have no plans to stop. From their inspirational travel videos to their
   educative travel advice you can see why they are one of the top travel
   bloggers. If we can achieve half of what they have we would be very
   happy.

   [51]Adventure Around Asia

   After coming across a retweet on Twitter linking to a blog post about
   [52]diving in Moalboal in the Philipines (thats another thing to add to
   our ever-growing itinerary for the Philippines) we checked it out and
   was hooked straight away. Richelle, the owner of Adventure Around Asia
   has put together a brilliant easy to navigate blog with tons of helpful
   information relating to travel around SE Asia. She has a wealth of
   knowledge regarding living, working and studying in China as she has
   done all three and still is living in Beijing. She even offers a
   service where you can ask her anything regarding living, working and
   studying in China. Go check it out!

   [53]Two Scots Abroad

   Scottish couple Gemma and Craig are the Two Scotts Abroad. They've both
   left their jobs and are currently on a 18 month trip travelling around
   the America's. Having visited over 25 countries between them (and still
   rising) they have put together a great blog including a fantastic
   [54]What and How section where they share all their wealth of travel
   knowledge. Covering from how to save and what to pack to how to write a
   travel blog. We look forward to reading what they get up to on the rest
   of their America's trip.

   [55]Backpacker Banter

   One of the first blogs we came across and have kept visiting ever
   since. Chris's laid back writing style draws you in to his funny and
   informative blog posts. We especially like his monthly budget post's
   where he goes into detail on what he's spent each month in the
   countries he's visited. It's helped us budget for our trip to Thailand
   in November. A gap year expert, inspiring photographer, surfer and a
   seemingly all round good guy.

   [56]Love and Road

   Only one way to start this really, Natalie and Robson are from Brazil
   and they love to PARTY!! (and travel of course). Probably one of the
   most down to earth and honest blogs we follow. We came across their
   blog while searching for info on travel costs for the Philippines, we
   were led to this [57]blog post and it answers all our questions we
   wanted to find out, plus more. After that initial  post we have kept
   visiting back ever since and enjoy every new post.


So that is our top travel bloggers. Who are your favourite blogs which
inspire you to travel more?
