   This is part 2 of a 4-part series in which we share the challenges
   we're posing for ourselves in 2015. Join us by challenging yourself to
   the same things. ([19]See Challenge 1)

   In late December, we quietly added this link to our nav: [20]Snap

   Within minutes, we saw these tweets:

     Hasn't seen this productized consulting offer by [21]@copyhackers
     [22]http://t.co/5rnYJqpVT3 <- this is how you make working with you
     a no brainer

     -- Robert Williams (@letsworkshop) [23]December 18, 2014

     Hey look, [24]@copyhackers launched another smart thing:
     [25]http://t.co/uVxRQru0nU Quick turnaround, high-quality copy for
     small jobs. -- Joel K (@JoelKlettke) [26]December 18, 2014

   We hadn't made any sort of effort to spread the word about Snap.

   Just posted a link.

   So to see those tweets so quickly, we were like, Oh, cool, Snap might
   be a good idea.

   A little over a week later, Jack from [27]Mentored posted Snap on
   [28]Product Hunt. We got 98 upvotes in 24 hours:

   Snap Copy Productized Copywriting Service on Product Hunt

   It finished at over 140 upvotes.

   So we were like, Oh, cool, Snap might be a good idea.

   Then our waiting list for Snap starting filling up. And someone on the
   waitlist managed to find a way to buy early, before the checkout was
   even QAed - evidently, he wanted what Snap has to offer, and he didn't
   wanna wait.

   So we were like, Oh, cool, Snap might be a good idea.

   Now, you might be saying, "Joanna, great, `good idea' or whatever, but
   what the hell is Snap and what does it dooo?"

   Well, here's our value prop:

Snap Makes Your Copy Waaay Better
in 48 Hours or Less

   Almost since the launch of Copy Hackers three years ago, Lance and I
   have had this idea for a productized copywriting service.

   We'd been calling it "Copy on Call" internally.

   The idea was that a business could pay a monthly fee in exchange for
   super-quick access to copy help. We liked the idea - seemed like the
   solution to a real problem, based on all the can-you-help-me-quickly
   emails we've received - yet the timing never seemed right to build the
   service and launch it.

   More recently, we've found ourselves addicted to Dan Norris's work over
   at [29]WP Curve.

   If you're not familiar with Dan, [30]you should be. Allow me to
   introduce you. I've been on Dan's list since before WP Curve... before
   Informly... all the way back to Web Control Room. I'd first heard of
   him thanks to a guest post he'd written for Corbett Barr in 2012 (back
   in Corbett's ThinkTraffic days - holy cow, does anyone still have the
   biz they had 2 years ago??). In that post, he described exactly what he
   did in just 3 hours of experimenting with 12 traffic-gen strategies:

   Dan Norris from WP Curve list of traffic strategies

   Clearly, Dan's one of those people who's thoroughly transparent about
   his business goings-on.

   What works. What doesn't.

   And, as a small biz owner, I dig that.

   I've always thought it's better to learn from someone else's battle
   scars than to earn your own. That's, like, the whole point of books and
   courses and mentors, isn't it?

   So, anyway, it's the beginning of December 2014, and Lance shouts at me
   from across the hall. He's just read [31]Dan's November report, and
   he's raving about how cool the WP Curve biz model is and how much it
   reminds him of Copy on Call. Our eyes meet. Significant silence
   follows. That leads to the beginning of a very, very long convo in
   which we wheel our chairs closer, pour coffee, drink coffee (I do),
   pour wine, drink wine, realize it's dark out, make dinner, eat dinner,
   and - all the while - list off the many things that have kept us from
   creating Copy on Call...

   I won't bore you with the list.

   It's a long one.

   Anyway, after that talk, we took our list of worries and objections -
   the things keeping us from building this business - and we called Dan.
   Yes, Dan was nice enough to take our call. Even though he's crazy busy.

   For nearly an hour, we picked Dan's brain.

   More accurately: we attacked Dan's brain.

   Sparked new ideas. Stomped down old ideas. Took pages of notes - the
   kind where the phone line goes quiet `cos we're so busy scratching pen
   on paper.

   By the time we ended the chat...

   ...we knew the time was right. We knew our biz wasn't going to be quite
   like Dan's, but we could borrow a lot from him. And we knew that, like
   Dan and the WP Curve team, we were about to solve a real problem for
   people we knew.

The Copy Problem Plaguing Startups and Marketing Departments

   We are living in a content marketing and conversion-rate optimization
   world, and I am a content marketing and conversion-rate optimization
   girl.

   (Sorry, that was a stretch.)

   All digital marketing requires words - it just does.

   You wanna write an AdWords ad? It might look like a small, easy little
   bit of copy to jot off - until you try to do it. Suddenly, it's not so
   easy. Not so much jotting going on. You might be able to write the ad
   fast... but how does it perform? Hmm... And then you've got your blog
   post headlines. If Upworthy and Buzzfeed have taught us anything, it's
   that the headlines you tack onto your posts may be more important than
   the posts themselves. Oh, and let's not forget our websites. And
   landing pages. And all those product descriptions. The drip campaigns.
   The newsletters. The follow-up emails after a webinar. And the
   triggered emails - those receipts you keep meaning to optimize. Hell,
   even the PPTs you're posting to Slideshare.

   It's. All. Words.

   Copy Hackers has helped turn some marketers and micropreneurs into
   confident writers. And that's awesome...

   ...But here's what I've seen: a copy hacker writes an email, reads it
   over thirty-two times, but still hesitates to hit `send' or `publish'.
   A lot of people are able to take their copy to 80%... but then they
   email me and ask for a second set of eyes. "Some quick feedback." They
   want help getting it to 99% or, dare they hope, 100%.

   Even if you have an internal or retained copywriter, you rarely have a
   large team of copywriting specialists at your disposal. You probably
   don't have an email specialist writing this email and an AdWords
   specialist writing that ad and a landing page specialist writing
   this landing page and a copy director looking over all those elements
   to make sure they work. And that's fine. If you're okay with your copy
   being at 80%. By which I mean, if you're okay with your online
   salesperson operating at an energy level around 80%...

   That's where Snap comes in.

   Snap is Copy on Call. It's just called Snap. :)

   Now, to be sure, Snap isn't for everyone.

   If you don't have recurring needs... if you're not actively
   marketing... if you don't want to build a long-term relationship and
   you don't want to turn Snap into your outsourced, on-demand copywriting
   team, then it's not for you. Snap will best serve:
     * Marketing teams at fast-growing online and tech businesses
     * Active SaaS marketers
     * Ecommerce
     * Information marketers and online educators

   We'll put not 1 but 2 copy pros on your job. We turn small jobs around
   in as few as 48 hours. You don't need to fuss with proposals. You can
   rate our work. And your first 2 credits are free.

   When I write that out, I feel a little flutter of excitement. Because
   we're really building something of immediate value for the people we
   know and love.

What I Want Snap to Be

   Naturally I have no idea what tomorrow holds. But here's my small list
   of big hopes for Snap, if you'll allow me to put myself out there for a
   second...

   I want to build a business. I do not want to make a cash machine.

   I want to build a happy team filled with people who feel good about the
   living they're making.

   I want to put everything I've used to help other businesses to work for
   this business.

   I want our clients to say, "Send it to Snap" and to make Snap part of
   every project they've got.

   I want our clients to get their copy back and think, Holy shit we're
   getting a good deal with these guys.

   I want to have company off-sites. And have team t-shirts. And send my
   team to training.

   I want to build a business the way some people in their 30s want to
   nest.

   Copy Hackers is a business, of course. It's a great business.

   Copy Hackers is like my husband: It makes me want to be better. We've
   got a ton of mutual friends. It happily provides for our family. I'm
   committed to it for the long run. I love it.

   Snap is like our child: I'll make myself uncomfortable to see it
   succeed (more about that in Challenge 4, coming this Friday). I'll give
   it far more than I'll take from it. It'll take a village - or about a
   dozen copywriters - to raise it. I can't wait to see what it turns
   into, and I'll have to try not to push it to be something it's not.

Today, We Launch Snap

   And to `quote' our account director Liston Witherill:

   IFRAME: [32]http://giphy.com/embed/F9hQLAVhWnL56?html5=true

   Yesterday, we opened up 5 spots to our waitlist. They sold out in about
   4 minutes.

   Today, we open 6 spots.

   [33]Click here to (ahem) snap up yours

   If we're sold out by the time you read this, please be sure to add
   yourself to the queue. If you're closer to the start of the queue,
   you'll hear about our availability before others further down the queue
   will. You may not have work for us right now, but if you think you'll
   want us to help out with your, say, product launch this spring, get in
   the queue, buy your credits, and then use them this spring. All credits
   are good for 12 months.

   So that's our second challenge. It'd be cool to work with you this
   year, and I hope we get a chance to.

   Either way, please [34]check out the Snap blog, too, where we'll be
   posting about our wins, losses and facepalms as we work toward our goal
   of building something that solves a problem for people we know.
