   [37]To Be Destroyed
     * [38]LACY - A1065089

[39]LACY - A1065089
       TO BE DESTROYED 02/18/16 ** RESCUE ONLY ** A volunteer writes:
       "Lacy is a pretty name for a mature and well mannered dame we have
       here at the Manhattan Care Center. She is understandably a little
       bit lost and a home sweet home would very quickly take care of her
       discomfort. Lacy is ready and waiting at her door. She is leashed
       in an instant and is just as fast in the street. She pulls a little
       on the leash, respects the birds and does not at all answer when
       another dog barks furiously at us. A real plus in a big city... She
       seems very much house trained, slowing down her pace after she has
       attended to her business. Free in a pen, she explores and hovers
       around me. She likes treats, will jump for them but also can sit on
       command. Upon request, she will settle by my side and relax with
       caresses and sweet talks.Lacy has not tried playgroups with other
       dogs yet because of the bad weather but she seems to enjoy the
       presence of her peers very much. Lacy' past is not known to us. She
       appears to have been a mother, is of a decent weight but her
       nutrition might not have been the best. Her coat is mat and she
       wears many calluses. Her beauty prevails , though and just imagine
       how gorgeous she will be in caring and loving hands...yours... Lacy
       is at the Manhattan Care Center, dreaming of a new and better life
       as your forever best friend." Time runs out for Lacy at noon
       tomorrow. Contact a New Hope approved rescue immediately, if you
       can help.
     * [40]GIA - A1065028

[41]GIA - A1065028
       TO BE DESTROYED 02/18/16 ** RESCUE ONLY ** Four year old Gia is
       facing a grim fate--she's on tomorrow's euthanasia list. Brought in
       by her owner to Brooklyn ACC because of landlord issues, Gia has
       lived her whole life with her person and 4 kids (7-21) and a cat. A
       tad protective of her family, Gia is leery of strangers and will
       growl and bark at people she doesn't know. Her family's solution
       was to walk her with a muzzle in case she got too upset. But at
       home with the family she knew, Gia was playful, tolerant of her
       kitty housemate, housebroken and used to walking 3 or 4 times a day
       (with wee wee pads as a backup). Predictably, Gia has not done well
       in the noisy, chaotic shelter where she knows no one and where she
       keeps looking for her people. Her behavioral eval was mixed--she
       got 1's and 2's on all items except for when they tried to squeeze
       her paw. She didn't interact much with the other dog she was
       introduced to. ACC assumes that Gia will never change, assumes that
       she should have been able to get over being left there in a few
       days, and assumes no one will see the good in Gia. They've made her
       New Hope only and tonight, Gia needs a very dog savvy person who
       understands that Gia is reacting to what to her is an intolerable
       ordeal. But unless that person works with a rescue to make
       arrangements to foster or adopt Gia by noon tomorrow, ACC won't
       hesitate to make this young, very pretty, very confused girl gone
       forever.
     * [42]SHEBA - A1064963

[43]SHEBA - A1064963
       TO BE DESTROYED 02/18/16 So who watched that German Shepherd almost
       take the whole show at Madison Square Garden this week? Well while
       the charmed dogs were strutting their stuff at Westminster, the
       less privileged like Sheba were languishing in the shelter. Sheba
       is around 2-years old and she weighs underweight at 47-pounds. Poor
       Sheba has spent most of her time in the yard. She is laden with
       fleas and she shows the signs of a dog who has been teased or
       tormented by humans. Sheba gets upset and growls when the kids in
       the household try to take away her precious bowl of food - a most
       cruel entertainment if you ask us. Sheba has never been to a vet
       although she is spayed. She doesn't hold any grudges but she
       doesn't quite know how to behave around people either. Sheba
       behaved acceptably around other dogs in the play yard although she
       was a bit frenetic. So Sheba is seeking a German Shepherd
       loving/dog savvy new family. Sheba says cats are ok by her. Who
       will save Sheba?
     * [44]MOCHA - A1064813

[45]MOCHA - A1064813
       TO BE DESTROYED 02/18/16 At just 11 months old, the "puppy" in
       Bulldog-mix Mocha still shines through. Noted to be "friendly" and
       "easy to handle" upon entry to the shelter, she may be naive enough
       to be oblivious to the life-threatening position she faces tonight.
       Without our help, Mocha will not live to celebrate her first
       birthday. Mocha will make a great lifelong and loyal companion to
       the person or family willing to step up for her tonight. Help Mocha
       forget her time at the ACC, and please share, foster or adopt.
       Please help us move Mocha to safety tonight.
     * [46]NICKI - A1064651

[47]NICKI - A1064651
       TO BE DESTROYED 02/18/16 Sadly, people often don't think how big
       that cute little puppy they got will become. Such is the case for
       Nicki-a stunning young girl who has gotten too big for her people.
       In good health when she got to Brooklyn ACC, there's also no
       questioning what a gorgeous girl she is. But ACC sees her as just
       another pitty and assumes no one will want her--they've got Nicki
       on tomorrow's euthanasia list. Tonight, Nicki is pleading for her
       young life. She wants to get out of that cage she's been in 24 x 7
       and run and play and do her business, and she wants to go for long
       walks and maybe some playtime in the yard or the doggie park, and
       most of all, she wants a new human bff that she can hang out with
       for many years to come. But unless someone steps up to foster or
       adopt Nicki by noon tomorrow, ACC won't hesitate to make her gone
       forever.
     * [48]PEPA - A1064156

[49]PEPA - A1064156
       TO BE DESTROYED 02/18/16 ** BRINDLE AND WHITE PITTY MIX ** Seems
       the ACC forgot the salt when naming this handsome young stray Pepa.
       He does have a nice peppered brindle coat that is highlighted with
       a pinch of salt white just to make Pepa that much more dashing.
       Pepa was a little nervous at intake. Who can blame him? A young dog
       ends up in a place that is bustling with new noises and strangers.
       Pepa in good doggy spirit allowed all handling and showed no signs
       of aggression. Pepa is a nice size sized Pitty mix, just fifty five
       pounds and only two years old. Chances for a young dog to find a
       home should be good, but the ACC of NYC is a quick kill shelter.
       Pepa has been listed to be destroyed tomorrow. He has a deadline of
       noon to find the right foster or adopter. Time to "Push It". Pepa
       has one life and the ACC's plan to kill him is not acceptable.
       Share, Advocate, and Pledge for Pepa's life !!
