   NORTHVALE -- Josh Gottheimer is a Democrat running for Congress in
   North Jersey's 5^th District.

   But had it not been for the presence of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker at his
   campaign kickoff, you might have missed his party affiliation. He
   barely mentioned it.

   In what will likely be the state's most closely contested congressional
   race, Gottheimer -- a 40-year-old former Bill Clinton speechwriter --
   formally kicked off his long-planned candidacy, positioning himself as
   a fiscal conservative and social progressive running against Rep. Scott
   Garrett, whom he called "one of the most rigid, right-wing members of
   Congress" and blamed for holding to ideology at the expense of economic
   progress.

   "I'm running for Congress because we need to kick out the tea party,
   kick out the do-nothing approach, kick up our economy a notch and make
   North Jersey a place where more businesses want to open up and grow,
   not pack up and leave," Gottheimer said.

   The 5th Congressional District is made up of parts of Bergen, Sussex,
   Warren and Passaic Counties and has been represented by Garrett, by far
   the most conservative member of New Jersey's congressional delegation,
   since 2003.

   Gottheimer held his kickoff at Inrad Optics, a high-tech company that
   specializes in photonics and has defense contracts with the federal
   government. Its president and CEO, Amy Ekelson, began the event by
   lamenting the 2013 government shutdown and subsequent spending cuts.

   "Why did sequestration happen? I believe it happened because of our
   legislators' intransigence and really, unwillingness to compromise and
   find a way forward," she said.

   The company's location -- in this well-heeled Bergen County suburb --
   is the type of place where Gottheimer needs to do well to unseat
   Garrett, whose base of conservative support lies in the district's
   rural areas of Warren and Sussex County. The town is slightly more
   Republican than Democratic and narrowly voted for Mitt Romney in 2012.
   And Gottheimer's speech was tailor-made to the type of Republicans who
   populate it: Those who elected Garrett's predecessor, the moderate
   Republican Marge Roukema, who represented the district for 20 years.

   Gottheimer is not the first Democrat to make a serious effort at
   unseating Garrett. In 2008, Dennis Shulman, a rabbi and psychologist,
   raised significant money and ran in a year with a Democratic wave. He
   lost badly. In 2014, Democrat Roy Cho also raised enough money to
   compete and in a poll close to the election appeared in striking
   distance of Garrett. On Election Day, he lost badly.

   "Every election I've faced an opponent that thinks the best solution to
   the problems that New Jerseyans face is letting Washington spend their
   money and tell them what to do," Garrett said in a statement. "Despite
   the rhetoric, the economy is in shambles and people here know that
   Washington is the problem. That's why I'm fighting for solutions that
   put families before special interests, rein in reckless spending, and
   empower people so they can pursue their goals and get ahead. We've seen
   these kind of attacks before, but the people of the Fifth District know
   my record as a fighter for a federal government that lives within its
   means, and I appreciate their continued support."

   But Garrett has [39]had fundraising trouble [40]since POLITICO
   reported that he had told colleagues he would not give to the National
   Republican Congressional Committee because it supported gay candidates.
   His fundraising, typically robust because of his chairmanship of a
   subcommittee that regulates Wall Street, began to decline as bank after
   bank opted to turn off the spigot.

   Gottheimer, who most recently was general manager for corporate
   strategy at Microsoft, has tapped his connections to the Clintons and
   raised money at a faster pace than Garrett, though he has only $1.3
   million on hand to the $2.4 million Garrett has accumulated.

   Despite his ties to Clinton, Gottheimer invoked former president Ronald
   Reagan twice in his kickoff speech, while he mentioned Clinton once.

   Gottheimer said he's seeking "comprehensive tax reform" with lower
   corporate tax rates and an immigration plan "so that millions of people
   can participate legally in the workforce and pay their taxes" -- though
   he did not say if he supports a path citizenship.

   Gottheimer dubbed Garrett "Dr. No" for voting against several pieces of
   leiglsation, including the last transportation bill, family medical
   leave legislation and the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation
   Act.

   This, Gottheimer said, led to missed economic opportunities he dubbed
   the "Garrett tax."

   "Let's cut the Garrett tax, let's cut the tea-party agenda and let's
   cut Scott Garrett out of Congress," Gottheimer said.

   Despite previous failed attempts at taking on Garrett, many Democrats
   believe Gottheimer is their best shot at unseating him.

   Booker -- who grew up just two miles from Northvale, in Harrington Park
   -- said Gottheimer "reflects, I think, the spirit of my home
   community."


   "This is an urgency for me, when you have someone who's so out of line
   with my community that I grew up in," Booker said. "People who are
   fiscally conservative, who embrace each others' differences in race,
   religion, gender and sexual orientation."
