`Play Your Part for a Better Internet' is the strapline for Safer Internet
Day 2016, which we're backing today (Tuesday) to help promote the safe,
responsible and positive use of digital technology for young people.

   [81]Click here to read The FA's Best Practice Guidelines.
   Safer Internet Day is celebrated in 100+ countries, with a website
   at [82]www.saferinternet.org.uk providing resources for children,
   schools and families. The day offers the opportunity to highlight
   positive uses of technology and to explore the role everyone plays in
   helping to create a better and safer online community. It calls upon
   young people, parents, carers, teachers, social workers, law
   enforcement, companies and policy makers to cooperate.
   It is coordinated in the UK by the UK Safer Internet Centre, a
   partnership of three leading charities; Childnet, the South-West Grid
   for Learning and the Internet Watch Foundation. The joint Insafe/INHOPE
   network are also involved, with the support of the European Commission
   and 31 national Safer Internet Centres across Europe.
   The Essex County FA are reminding all those involved within football to
   interact online responsibly and to promote the values of The FA's
   Respect Programme, both on the field of play and online. The day offers
   the opportunity to highlight The FA's best practice guidance in
   relation to social media and explore the role everyone plays in helping
   to create a safe online environment within football.
   County Welfare Officer, Helen Hever, explained: "A lot of young people
   in the UK do much of their socialising within football teams, so this
   is an important day in the calendar. It's crucial for us to offer
   support if they have concerns and to play our part in educating them in
   the positive ways of using the Internet."
   Leagues, clubs and coaches can play their part by adding links to
   support outlets and advice on web pages, Facebook and Twitter. They can
   also follow The FAs best practice guidance to ensure clubs and leagues
   manage online environments and communications, properly guaranteeing
   they are safe for all involved.
   Players can be kind and respectful to others online and seeking
   positive and safe opportunities to create, engage and share online.
   Parents and carers can maintain an open and honest dialogue with their
   children about their online lives by modelling positive online
   behaviours themselves, and also by reporting any inappropriate or
   illegal content they find.
   Find out more at [83]www.saferinternet.org.uk. Follow [84]@UK_SIC on
   Twitter and use [85]the hashtag #SID2016 to join discussions on Safer
   Internet Day. Further details on grassroots football can be found in
   the menus above, [86]on Twitter @EssexCountyFA and by searching [87]for
   `EssexFootball' on Facebook.
