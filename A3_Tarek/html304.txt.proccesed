   Skyhigh research has found that 87.3% of enterprises have at least 100
   active Office 365 users and the average enterprise uploads 1.37 TB to
   Office 365, but only 6.8% of corporate users have fully migrated to
   Office 365.
   This disparity is due to the fact that most organizations migrate users
   in stages while maintaining a hybrid on-premises and cloud environment
   due in part to uncertainties relating to security.
