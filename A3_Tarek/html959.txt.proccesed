3 Social Media Engagement Techniques That Work

   [20]social media how to Need some new social media marketing ideas?

   Looking for ways to jumpstart your engagement?

   Whether your goal is to spread awareness or grow your audience, better
   engagement is your key to success.

   In this article you'll discover three ways to improve engagement for
   your social media accounts.
   social media engagement techniques

   Discover three techniques you can use to improve social media
   engagement.

#1: Personalize Your Approach

   Your audience is the greatest asset for your campaign. To run a
   successful social campaign with plenty of engagement, you have to know
   your [21]audience and what they're likely to respond to and enjoy.

   To gain these insights, you'll need to do some research. Find out which
   social media channels the people you want to reach spend the most time
   on. Discover what topics they care about and what [22]hashtags they
   use.

   Don't just listen to your audience, but communicate with them. When you
   show your fans that you're interested and you care, and they'll show
   you what makes them happy. Once you know what they're looking for, you
   can launch a social media campaign that they'll embrace.

   Many brands have leveraged Pinterest to run successful social
   campaigns, including Kotex's [23]Woman's Inspiration Day. The company
   looked at the Pinterest boards for 50 inspiring women to see what
   interested them.

   destbranding=1&iv_load_policy=3&showsearch=0&rel=0&theme=dark

   Kotex then brought their inspirations to life by creating handmade
   gifts and sending them to the women as virtual gifts. If the women then
   posted something about their virtual gift, they received a real gift
   from the company in the mail.

   Almost all of the 50 women responded, generating 2,284 interactions and
   694,853 impressions on Pinterest. The campaign was a huge hit because
   Kotex was able to hyper-target a specific audience and what they want.
   This is just one of many examples of how you can use [25]Pinterest to
   launch a successful social campaign.

#2: Put the Product in Your Fan's Hands

   Remember the core goal of social media is to be social, so it's
   important to cultivate relationships with your fans and followers. This
   is an essential step to launching a successful social media campaign.

   Yes, your ultimate goal is to [26]sell your product and your brand, but
   for the purposes of your social media campaign, take a step back on the
   selling and simply share. Don't force your product or your brand on
   your audience or they'll stop listening to you. Opt for subtlety
   instead. Give people a way to share your product in a fun and unique
   way and let your audience come to it.

   Ford's Fiestagram Instagram campaign created buzz for the release of
   their new Fiesta model by asking fans to post pictures that related to
   different campaign hashtags.
   [27][SME-Large-Surfer-560x467.jpg]

   Each hashtag was a buzzword describing one of the features of the new
   Fiesta car, such as #music, #entry, #hidden, etc. Ford then chose the
   best pictures for each hashtag and displayed them on digital
   billboards. They also awarded weekly prizes to fans who submitted
   photos for the campaign.

   More than [28]16,000 photos were submitted to the Fiestagram campaign
   and Ford gained 120,000 new fans on their social media pages.

   Lay's launched the clever Do Us a Flavor campaign on
   Facebook that asked fans and consumers to come up with a new flavor of
   potato chip for the company to create and sell. That year, nearly 4
   million people submitted their flavor ideas via Facebook or text
   message.
   lays contest

   Lay's Do Us a Flavor campaign asked fans to submit ideas for a new
   flavor of potato chip.

   Once the finalists were chosen, Lay's asked fans to vote for the
   winning flavor on Facebook, receiving over 1 million votes. The prize
   for the winning flavor was $1 million (or 1% of sales for the chip
   flavor). The first campaign increased Lay's sales by [29]12% and was so
   successful at generating engagement for the brand that they continue to
   run it each year.

   If you offer your fans a chance to showcase their creativity and
   connect it to one of your products, you can establish a respectful
   relationship with your audience, linking their personal creations to
   your company.

#3: Play the Tag Game

   Before you launch a [30]social media campaign, you need to know what
   your goal is. Without a firm plan in mind, you're almost certainly
   setting yourself up for failure. It's important to identify not only
   what you want to accomplish, but also the audience you're targeting and
   how you want to connect with them.

   The [31]ALS Ice Bucket Challenge campaign was launched to raise
   awareness and funding for ALS. The "challenge" was for people to dump a
   bucket of ice over their heads and record a video of it to increase
   awareness of the disease.
   als icebucketchallenge video post

   People who took the challenge spurred more engagement by nominating
   others to take the challenge.

   After each challenge, the person taking it would nominate two or three
   more people to take the challenge and so on until people around the
   world were participating. The campaign grew exponentially in a short
   amount of time. So what made this campaign great? The call to action:
   Dump ice water on your head, and tag someone else to participate. It
   was simple, but impactful.

   In your social campaigns, use a simple call to action to make it easy
   for people to complete the goal.

   Over to You

   Social media is one of the greatest tools you can use to grow your
   business and promote your brand. Launching social media campaigns helps
   you spread [32]awareness and build an audience.

   To jumpstart participation in your social media campaign, you need a
   core group of people who are 100% behind your launch to get it off the
   ground. One way to do that is to create a beta group and give them
   exclusive perks.

   What do you think? Have you used these tactics in your social media
   campaigns? What tips can you offer? Please share your thoughts in the

       Thanks for nice sharing. Really !!! informative.
     * Marc-André Paquin
       You hit the nail on the head here. It can be a struggle for
       businesses to generate awareness and build an audience. You've
       provided some great examples on how to do this successfully. I was
       wondering if you had other examples from smaller businesses and
       organizations that you feel stand out when it comes to generating
       social engagement.
       Thanks!

       This one article sparked a firestorm of possibilities for me. It's
       worth its weight in gold. It can be used by a sole proprietor with
       no marketing budget whatsoever. Thanks!
     * Katie Leimkuehler
       Thanks for the kind words Gloria! Glad you got some good ideas.
       Best of luck with them!
     * Melissa Kaye Zeppa
       Great ideas...clearly what "Social Media Marketing" was/is?
       supposed to be about. (Anyone else find the shift in emphasis to
       paid ads ironic..."engage don't sell"...but now the platforms don't
       want to let you if you don't pay for it) (oh I do understand that
       from their point of view)
       I too would like to know where you can read about case studies from
       much smaller companies with successful implementations.
     * Abdul Fahad Hussaini
       Too good, each tip is unique and can apply to all types of
       businesses. This is going to be viral!
     * Katie Leimkuehler
       Thanks for the comment and glad you found it valuable!
     * Nelsee
       What is a "beta group"? And how do you create one?
     * Katie Leimkuehler
       Hi Nelsee thanks for the question! A beta group is usually used to
       test out a new product, service or idea. These are a select group
       of individuals that typically get a lower price or free product for
       giving their feedback on it. You create one by asking people who
       you think are solid fans and brand advocates to participate in the
       beta group. They often feel special and elite for being part of the
       process to help shape the design and functions or service of the
       product.

       Great tips Katie!
       Engaging to followers is just like talking to your bestfriend.
