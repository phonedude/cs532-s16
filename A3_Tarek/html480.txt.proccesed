Be Outrageous in Your Desiring!

   "I give thanks that I now receive the righteous desires of my
   heart. Mountains are removed, valleys exalted and every crooked place
   made straight.  I am in the Kingdom of fulfillment." - Florence Scovel
   Shinn

   outrageous in desiring

   Here's the only thing you are responsible for: Identifying what you
   want. NOT how it'll come to you.

   This is one of my favorite intention exercises based on the teachings
   of Abraham Hicks:

   Daily Deliberate Creation Workshop: Pen and paper needed.

   1. Make a list of  wants and "Why I Want This."

   2. On the other side, make a list of "Why I KNOW that I Will Create
   This." to add emotion to the thought of what you want, and building
   expectation of receiving it.

   3.  Ask yourselves, "What would it be like, if/when. . .?" And let your
   imagination loose like a pack of wild wolves and dive deep into the
   deliciousness of that experience.

   4. Create a Prosperity Box (as fancy-schmanzy as you'd like) and put
   the powerfully charged intention (piece of paper) into the box.

   5. Wait for it to manifest.

   Once you have completed the above steps, you would have `launched the
   creation process!

   BONUS: Declare what you would like to have happen during the next
   "segment" of your day. As often as you need during the day, set an
   intention for what it is you want to bring into your experience as the
   day unfolds. (Builds and AWESOME manifesting muscle!)

   Your Turn: What are some of your favorite manifesting techniques and
   tools?

   Share this with you friends too! I'd love to know what they have in
   their manifesting toolbox.

   To your Outrageous Wanting,

   Erika
