I'm not talking about \"crossing the chasm,\" the phrase that Moore made famous and that is now part of the general business lexicon. I'm talking about \"IT doesn't matter,\" the title of a 2003 HBR article written by Nicholas Carr. The point that Carr was making then was that because IT (information technology) was no longer a differentiator because every business had it. At last week's event, blogger/journalist <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/does-it-matter-once-more-is-it-strategic/\">Tom Foremski asked if the notion still held true today</a>. Moore agreed that we're at a point where innovation in IT&nbsp;again has strategic value for the enterprise. We're just at a different point in a never-ending cycle. Said Moore: \"the goal should be at any given time for IT to go from mattering to not mattering.\"\r\n\r\nMoore was on my mind this weekend, when I first got wind that one of the original groups supporting&nbsp;<a href='http://www.forbes.com/social-media/'>social media</a> -- the Society for New Communications Research (SNCR) -- was <a href=\"https://www.conference-board.org/sncr/\">merging with The Conference Board,</a> an industry consortium of business leaders that is soon celebrating its first centennial.\r\n\r\nYes -- a one-hundred year old organization is merging&nbsp;with a <em>ten-year</em> old organization, and yes, it matters.\r\n\r\nI've got some perspective on this. I was a founding fellow at SNCR. The Conference Board is a former client. And I brokered the introduction in 2014. From where I sit, there are at least three things that make this union noteworthy.\r\n\r\nFirst, although social media has been adopted by practically every business in the Fortune 1000 (the market that The Conference Board serves), it is being used strategically -- i.e., as a true differentiator -- at far fewer organizations. The integration of SNCR research -- and its network of researchers and consultants -- gives members of The Conference Board the opportunity to look fresh at social, particularly in areas that are not yet common practice.\r\n\r\nSecond, one area of practice that will soon find its way into the SNCR curriculum could have a profound impact on both marketing and marketing professionals: automation technology. There are two competing narratives that have emerged: (1) robots (automation) will steal your job, or (2) robots will make you smarter. Because senior social professionals have earned the \"brand permission\" to advise their organizations on digital disruption, they are uniquely positioned to help lead this important conversation.\r\n\r\nBut what interests me most about the merger has little to do with digital disruption, and more with the approach to engagement that informed both organizations at their inception. For SNCR -- which is known for their industry roundtables -- its about creating intimate offline experiences that support professional growth. For The Conference Board -- which has been doing industry roundtables since the Wilson presidency -- it's the same thing. Just one big difference: The Conference Board has been doing it at scale. In the end, the opportunity for The Conference Board and SNCR may be to accelerate the next wave of online innovation using the more ancient offline tools of community building. That would be a big change indeed, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/giovannirodriguez/2013/07/27/social-medias-older-but-wiser-ancestor-the-native-american-talking-stick/#2052630f38c5\">and one that I can believe in.</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Related: Shel Holtz posted a podcast about today's news <a href=\"http://firpodcastnetwork.com/fir-interview-jen-mcclure-and-alex-parkinson-on-sncr-conference-board-merger/\">here.</a></strong></p>","description":"Last week -- at an industry event that I helped organize in Silicon Valley -- the great marketing strategist Geoffrey Moore was asked to reflect on the impact of one of the most enduring catch phrases in business.

I was a founding fellow at SNCR. The Conference Board is a former client. And I brokered the introduction in 2014. From where I sit, there are at least three things that make this union noteworthy.</p>\n<p>First, although social media has been adopted by practically every business in the Fortune 1000 (the market that The Conference Board serves), it is being used strategically — i.e., as a true differentiator — at far fewer organizations. The integration of SNCR research — and its network of researchers and consultants — gives members of The Conference Board the opportunity to look fresh at social, particularly in areas that are not yet common practice.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Second, one area of practice that will soon find its way into the SNCR curriculum could have a profound impact on both marketing and marketing professionals: automation technology. There are two competing narratives that have emerged: (1) robots (automation) will steal your job, or (2) robots will make you smarter. Because senior social professionals have earned the “brand permission” to advise their organizations on digital disruption, they are uniquely positioned to help lead this important conversation.</p>\n<p>But what interests me most about the merger has little to do with digital disruption, and more with the approach to engagement that informed both organizations at their inception. For SNCR — which is known for their industry roundtables — its about creating intimate offline experiences that support professional growth. For The Conference Board — which has been doing industry roundtables since the Wilson presidency — it’s the same thing. Just one big difference: The Conference Board has been doing it at scale. In the end, the opportunity for The Conference Board and SNCR may be to accelerate the next wave of online innovation using the more ancient offline tools of community building. That would be a big change indeed, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/giovannirodriguez/2013/07/27/social-medias-older-but-wiser-ancestor-the-native-american-talking-stick/#2052630f38c5\" target=\"_self\">and one that I can believe in.</a></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Related: Shel Holtz posted a podcast about today’s news <a href=\"http://firpodcastnetwork.com/fir-interview-jen-mcclure-and-alex-parkinson-on-sncr-conference-board-merger/\">here.</a></strong></p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology"},{"id":"channel_3section_76","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Social Media","url":"/social-media"}],"pTagCount":8,"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"Does Social Media Matter?
