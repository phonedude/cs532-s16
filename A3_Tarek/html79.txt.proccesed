       Tesla Motors and SolarCity share a lot -- Elon Musk, a focus on new
       energy technologies, and racy valuations. As of this week, they are
       both also touting efforts to live more within their means. It is a
       sign of the times.
       Racing Partners
       Indexed share price performance

       SolarCity actually [104]got with the program a few months ago when
       it said it would scale back growth in order to rein in costs. Yet
       its latest results, released Tuesday, showed that, so far, there's
       been progress on the slowing down front but not much else:
       [105]Cash burn hit a new record in the fourth quarter. The stock is
       more than 50 percent below where it was in late October.
       Tesla, whose own stock has fallen by a mere 32 percent in that
       time, must hope it can do better. It reported results a day later
       and said it will be cash-flow positive for much of this year. "Cash
       is king," its chief financial officer -- recently installed, like
       SolarCity's -- declared on Wednesday's call. But so is growth:
       Tesla plans to deliver between 55 and 74 percent more vehicles this
       year, as well as tee up the hotly anticipated Model 3 car and, of
       course, crank up the Gigafactory in Nevada.
       A big red flag is how Tesla measures cash flow. High up in the
       shareholder letter released Wednesday, the company touted "$179
       million of positive cash flow from our core operations defined as
       cash flow consumed in operations of $30 million plus cash of $209
       million received from vehicle sales to our leasing partners" -- a
       definition of positive cash flow that looks as engineered as those
       troublesome 'Falcon Wing' doors on the Model X.
       In response to a question on Wednesday evening's call, Tesla
       confirmed this figure is flattered by the cash Tesla receives under
       an asset-backed facility to finance some vehicle deliveries -- or
       "short-term borrowing," as most other people might call it.
       In reality, Tesla actually burned through less cash -- when defined
       as cash from operations less capital expenditure -- in the fourth
       quarter than in the third. Which makes it odd that the
       company chose this quarter to stop reporting free cash flow as a
       separate line in the shareholder letter. Perhaps it is because,
       even with the slower pace, the number was still negative to the
       tune of $441 million.
       It's All Relative
       Tesla's free cash flow

       Source: Bloomberg, the company
       Overall, Tesla burned through $2.16 billion of cash in 2015. That
       is more than double 2014's amount and, since we are on the subject
       of guidance, also more than double the "less than" $1 billion
       Tesla's former CFO projected this time last year.
       Over the course of 2015, long-term debt, net of cash, virtually
       tripled to $1.44 billion. And Tesla now has $1.2 billion of cash,
       with CFO Jason Wheeler saying $1 billion is "a nice comfort level"
       in terms of the minimum needed to run the business. Tesla says it
       won't need to access more outside financing this year. Yet it
       expects capital expenditure to be $1.5 billion, down only slightly
       from last year's level, as it sticks to the [106]growth promises
       that underpin its flagging stock as well as [107]some of the wilder
       Wall Street analyst price targets.
       Like SolarCity, Tesla projects a relatively slow first quarter,
       guiding for just 16,000 deliveries. And, again like SolarCity, that
       means some real acceleration will be required in order to hit the
       annual target. Even at the low end, deliveries will need to average
       more than 21,000 in each of the next three quarters, which is 22
       percent higher than the fourth quarter's record total. That isn't
       ludicrous speed: The roughly 17,500 vehicles delivered in the final
       quarter of 2015 were about 50 percent higher than in each of prior
       year's other three quarters. And the new Model X is only just
       beginning to reach customers.
       In very crude terms, an extra 30,000 to 40,000 vehicles should mean
       $2.5 to $3.5 billion of extra non-GAAP revenue -- which, as so
       often with Tesla, kindles hopes that genuine profitability is just
       around the corner. The problem is that there is such scant evidence
       to date of any operating leverage. Revenue last year jumped by
       almost half, but the gross margin fell by roughly 4 percentage
       points -- and that is on a non-GAAP basis.
       Tesla says this year that it expects operating expenses to rise by
       only 20 percent, again implying that the turning point is at hand.
       Yet, as problems with the Model X launch have shown, stuff happens
       when you are trying to reinvent driving. In one of the more
       memorable exchanges from Wednesday evening's call, Musk had this to
       say about some fiddly seals:

     Yeah, the seals have been a huge pain. I mean, essentially the
     seals had to be redesigned, and then the seals that we did have had
     to be reworked by hand in order to sort of fit correctly. Yeah.
     Seals are a bane.
       Indeed. Such mundanities are also the bane of frothy forecasts and
       share prices. Just like SolarCity, Tesla's new mantra of high
       growth alongside stringent cash and cost management is itself a
       signal that we may have reached a turning point -- in the market's
       patience, at least.
       This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg
       LP and its owners.
