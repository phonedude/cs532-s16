by [57]David Stockman  o  February 10, 2016

   It was a bad hair night for the Beltway. Among the roughly 515,000
   votes cast in the New Hampshire primaries, about 55% or 280,000 went to
   Bernie, the Donald and Senator Cruz. That is, the preponderance of
   Republican, Democrat and independent votes alike went for
   the anti-establishment candidates. Since the latter are basically

How Turkey Blackmailed The EU---Either EUR Three Billion Or Busloads Of
Refugees

by [157]Contributor  o  February 10, 2016

   [158]Tweet about this on Twitter [159]Share on Facebook [160]Share on

   By Keep Talking Greece

   In internal EU memo obtained by Greek media reveals the blatant Turkish
   blackmail on the refugee crisis. The memo contains a summary of the
   dialogue between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with European
   Commissioner Jean Claude Juncker and President of the European Council
   Donald Tusk on 16th November 2015 during the G20 Summit in Antalya,
   Turkey. The three Presidents were discussing the Action Plan to tackle
   the Refugees and Migrants Crisis.

   According to the memo, the bargain was hard and Turkey demanded 30
   billion euro from the European Union in order to refrain from sending
   refugees and migrants to Europe through Greece.

   EU's offer was 3 billion euro in two years, but Erdogan demanded 3
   billion euro per year.

   Turkey EU refugees

   In addition, Ankara threatened, that if the EU does not link the
   refugee issue to Turkey's EU accession then it would:

   1. Send buses full of refugees to Europe via Greece and Bulgaria and
   will let 10,000-15,000 refugees drown on its shores.

   2. Turkey does not accept the 3 billion euro for two years he had
   agreed with and wants 3 billion a year at least, otherwise there will
   be no agreement.

   3. Requests opening all accession funds soon and non instructions from
   the European Commission.

   4. The European Commission deliberately delayed the publication of
   Turkey's progress report, at the same Erdogan's request to help him win
   the election.

   Turkey EU refugees1

   Overwhelmed with arrogance Erdogan complains that the EU treated Turkey
   like a fool for 53 years and did not allow it to become full EU
   member, he compares a country like Luxembourg with the size of small
   Turkish town.

   He also claimed that "Greece received 400 billion euro from Europe"
   during the economic crisis and that in fact Turkey should get a huge
   amount of money too. The two EU Officials told him, not to compare the
   Greek economic crisis with the refugee crisis. He claimed that the 3
   billion euro will go for the refugees and not for Turkey.

   The three-party meeting ended without an agreement.

   What is worth noting is that neither Juncker, nor Tusk informed the
   other EU-member states about Turkey's approach. Also the media covering
   the G20 summit were apparently told that "the ball was rolling". but in
   fact there was a total media blackout on the EU-Turkey negotiations.

   And at the end of the EU-Turkey agreement and Action Plan ...what? The
   EU is expected to start pouring to Turkey -as it seems - part of the 3
   billion euro as of end of February or beginning of March.

   All we can do is to wait and see how Ankara will deal with the refugees
   and migrants.

   I suppose, the EU leaked this internal memo to the Greek media, after
   Turkey complained that [163]it has not received any more yet.

   Turkey can't be ignored or ridiculed. It's a big country and NATO
   member right inbetween Europe and the middle east.Without Turkey on
   board, ISIS can't be defeated. That may be a disagreeable truth, but
   that's the what the world has to relate to...

   let 10,000-15,000 refugees drown on its shores.no problem will
   discourage future immigration

   and finally a use for NATO  station troops on the greek and bulgarian
   borders and turn them back with lethal force if necessary once the
   immigrants get the message you arent getting any futher then turkey
   they will quit comning

   Brutal you bet but lets all sit around the campfire and sing kumbayya
   is what has turned america into the shithole it is today

   do any of you have any idea how much money is being siphoned off the
   refugee crisis

   stop them dead  in their tracks and send them back to their country
   mabey once they figure out its their country they had better do
   something about their problem it will get resolved
