Watch: Donald Trump is Johnny Depp's Most Insane Role of All Time

   You've never seen Depp like this before, and that's saying something.

   "The Art of the Deal: The Movie"
   Funny Or Die "The Art of the Deal: The Movie"

   Forget Johnny Depp's supposed comeback by playing the gangster Whitey
   Bulger in last year's "Black Mass," the actor is really proving his
   chops as Donald Trump in the just-released [138]Funny or Die
   mockumentary "The Art of the Deal: The Movie." Yes, you read that
   correctly, and given the actor's knack for playing bizarre,
   otherworldly characters, it's rather shocking it took him this long to
   sink his teeth into Trump.

   [139]READ MORE: Telluride Review: Johnny Depp is Trying Something Very
   Different in 'Black Mass

   "The Art of the Deal: The Movie," which takes its name from Trump's
   1987 bestselling business book, presents itself as a long-lost film
   Trump made back in the 1980s, now unearthed by one Ron Howard, who
   serves as the documentary's narrator. Other celebrities who appear
   include Alfred Molina, Kristen Schaal, Andy Richter, Paul
   Scheer,  Robert Morse, Patton Oswalt, Jack McBrayer, Michaela Watkins,
   Henry Winkler, Christopher Lloyd, Stephen Merchant and Rob Huebel.

   The project was shot in secret last fall by Funny Or Die
   Editor-in-Chief Owen Burke, long before anyone involved knew that Trump
   would still be the frontrunner in the Republican presidential race.
   "The Art of the Deal: The Movie"
   Funny or Die "The Art of the Deal: The Movie"

   "The plan was to move really fast because we thought Trump would go
   away, as least as a presidential candidate," he told [140]The New York
   Times about the project. "When he bizarrely didn't go away, we had a
   little more time. But that meant keeping the secret for longer."

   "It was a crazy, completely nuts idea that somehow we pulled off,"
   added Adam McKay, co-founder of Funny Or Die and current Best Director
   Oscar nominee for "The Big Short."

   The performance Depp gives as Trump ranks as some of his most bonkers
   work ever, which is saying something, given his recent roles in such
   fare as "Tusk" and "Mortdecai." The entire 50-minute mockumentary is
   now available for a limited time [141]exclusively on Funny Or Die, but
   you can check out some of the absurdity in the hilarious trailer below.
