Wanna be startin' somethin': a history of the Windows Start menu

Microsoft's most identifiable product has had 20 years of ups and downs

By Tom Warren | Illustrations by T.C. Sottek

   Microsoft's Start menu is a big deal. It's the first thing many people
   think of when they think of Windows, or even Microsoft. The simple
   Start menu has existed for more than 20 years now. It started off as a
   way to make Windows easier to use, and now it's the center of how we
   interact with Windows on a daily basis. Whether it's launching apps,
   searching for documents, or simply shutting down your PC, you probably
   use the Start menu more than you think.

   Microsoft's Start menu made its first appearance with Windows 95. It
   quickly became the go-to menu to find everything you needed from your
   PC, and it changed very little until the blue-and-green theme of
   Windows XP. The Start menu became so intertwined with the identity of
   Windows that users freaked out when it disappeared in Windows 8. It
   didn't take long for Microsoft to reverse course: the Start menu was
   brought back to life with Windows 10.

   Microsoft has tried a variety of different Start menus over the years,
   but the Windows 10 version is the best combination of the modern ideas
   the company has attempted and the classic menu. The Start menu is
   iconic, and it's the identity of Windows. As long as Microsoft doesn't
   have any crazy ideas, it's probably here to stay for many, many more
   years.

   Twenty years is a long time for any software, so let's take a look at
   how exactly the Start menu, and by extension, Windows itself, has
   changed since Windows 95.

Start me up

   Windows 95 Back in 1995, people lined up at midnight to get Microsoft's
   latest release of Windows, and it was the first version, alongside the
   enterprise-focused Windows NT 4, to introduce the Start menu. It was
   designed to make Windows easier to use, and group or organize
   applications in a list. Before it arrived, Windows users could access
   apps through Program Manager. It was largely a basic list of apps, with
   no real organization. While Program Manager did have smaller menus,
   most Windows users simply launched apps and used it as a list. Windows
   needed an overhaul. The Start menu was just that overhaul to bring
   Windows into the next era of computing.

   Windows 95's Start menu arrived alongside the taskbar. The taskbar
   offered quick access to volume options, the time and date, and even an
   indication of network activity. Any apps that you launched in Windows
   95 would sit neatly on the taskbar, making them easy to leave open and
   access repeatedly, and you'd find most of them from the new Start menu.
   Microsoft kept the idea of a list of apps in its new menu, but it was
   laid out into categories and neatly organized and you could simply drag
   and drop apps into place. The menu itself became the default way to
   launch apps from a simple click of the Start button.

   The combination of Start button and menu meant you always activated the
   menu from the lower left-hand side. Even when other apps were used, the
   Start button was always visible and ready to be used to access
   additional apps or folders. It negated the need to use Command Prompt
   for the vast majority of users, and became familiar as the first place
   you'd check to find documents, help, settings, or just the ability to
   turn your PC off.

   It kickstarted a trend in Windows that has lasted more than 20 years,
   and made it easy for people new to computers to easily navigate around.
   The Start menu was also an efficient way to store and organize a lot of
   quick shortcuts in one place.

   Windows 98 - 2000 At first glance, the Windows 98 Start menu doesn't
   look very different to the original. A new log off option to support
   98's new multi-user interface was added alongside the same iconography,
   layout, and basic functions as the Windows 95 version. Beyond that,
   Windows 98's Start menu ushered in the internet era. Microsoft added a
   favorites folder on the Start menu to complement the bundling of
   Internet Explorer with Windows 98. Most of the internet-related
   features were designed for the active desktop with widgets, but the
   Windows 98 Start menu played a small, but important role in making
   Windows a little more internet friendly.
   "The internet age was helped along by Windows 98's Start menu"

   The taskbar saw bigger changes. Microsoft introduced a new Quick Launch
   section that let Windows 98 users pin their favorite apps. Quick Launch
   also included the "show desktop" option to quickly check the desktop
   and minimize open apps, even when apps were maximized to take up the
   entire screen. As the desktop contained widgets and Windows users love
   to save documents to the desktop, the show desktop feature became a
   useful option to complement the taskbar, desktop, and Start menu.

   Windows ME might have been full of bugs and issues (it didn't earn its
   nickname "Windows Mistake Edition" for nothing), but the Start menu
   remained a consistent and stable feature. Little changed from the
   Windows 98 version, but Microsoft decided to place the full Windows ME
   branding along the side of the menu. That made it look a little ugly,
   but it was the last time we'd see this type of layout and design for
   the default version of the Start menu.

   Windows 2000 was designed for professionals, but the Start menu was
   almost identical to Windows ME. Microsoft made some minor changes to
   pin Windows Update and set program access and defaults to the top of
   the Start menu. It was a quicker way to access settings to uninstall
   apps or change default apps, and the Windows Update shortcut was
   designed to provide quicker access to all important security updates.

   Just like Windows ME, the taskbar in Windows 2000 remained relatively
   unchanged from Windows 98. This is the last time we'll see the
   traditional gray interface as the default setting for the Start menu.

New experiences

   Windows XP - Windows 7 Windows XP gave us the first significant visual
   overhaul to the Start menu since Windows 95. It looked radically
   different. Microsoft picked a blue-and-green theme for XP's Start menu,
   and many were quick to criticize its "Fisher Price" look at the time.
   The blue theme extended into the entire taskbar, and Microsoft began
   tweaking the system tray to hide unused icons by default. It was easy
   to get them back and drop them into the full system tray, but it helped
   keep the system tray under control at a time when many app developers
   started taking advantage of it.

   The actual Start menu itself split into two panes, with regularly used
   or pinned apps on the left and quick access to documents, settings,
   help, and search on the right. It was familiar, but also very
   different. The traditional application list on the Start menu was
   accessible from the All Programs link, and if you really wanted the old
   Start menu back then you could enable a classic theme. At the time, a
   lot of third-party skinners produced a variety of themes to customize
   the Start menu and overall look of Windows XP.
   "Windows Vista's Start menu put search front and center"

   Microsoft took its Windows XP Start menu changes and tweaked them even
   further with Windows Vista. While the Start menu looked similar, there
   were some fundamental changes that alienated longtime Windows users.
   Microsoft switched to a transparent menu as part of its
   futuristic-looking "Aero Glass" theme. It was a visual look that many
   enjoyed, but the translucent effects were also distracting and
   irritating at times, not to mention taxing for a lot of older and
   lower-end PCs. Microsoft extended this theme throughout the Start menu,
   app windows, taskbar, and even in a new sidebar that contained live
   gadgets.

   The Start menu itself changed to a darker look and feel, with simple
   icons in the taskbar for the Show desktop option and a new 3D flip
   interface that tiled apps together. Vista's Start menu lacked any
   visual cues for links to documents, the control panel, or other
   settings, which made it difficult to scan quickly and access these
   options. It was a long list of text on the right-hand side, and
   frequent or pinned apps on the left.

   Microsoft's biggest change to the Vista Start menu came with built-in
   search. In Vista you could simply hit the Windows key and start typing
   for what you wanted to search for. The importance of the Windows key or
   Windows logo permeated throughout Microsoft's keyboards and mice, and a
   new "ultimate" keyboard shipped with the Windows key in the center to
   quickly access search or the Start menu. Microsoft also removed the
   "start" branding from the Vista Start menu, and replaced it with a
   Windows orb to further push the Windows branding in Vista.

   Continuing the trend of tweaks over the years, Microsoft made very few
   changes to the Start menu with Windows 7. The shutdown button became
   more prominent and easy to spot, but Microsoft kept the lack of visual
   elements and flat text for shortcuts. Microsoft tweaked its search
   feature for the Windows 7 Start menu, with better performance and
   faster queries for documents and settings.

   Most of the Windows 7 interface changes were found in the taskbar or
   the way apps interacted with each other. Microsoft introduced Aero Snap
   to let Windows 7 users snap apps side by side. Aero Shake also appeared
   and allowed users to shake their mouse to initiate the Show desktop
   command. Microsoft even moved the traditional Show desktop shortcut
   from the Quick Launch area to the right-hand side of the taskbar.

The beginning is the end is the beginning

   Windows 8 - Windows 10 Microsoft decided that it was done with the
   Start menu for Windows 8. It turned out to be a mistake that alienated
   and panicked Windows users. The familiar Start menu was replaced with a
   fullscreen Start screen with colorful Live Tiles. Windows 8 was the
   most drastic change to the Start menu in its entire existence, and the
   most drastic change to Windows itself.

   Microsoft removed the familiar Start button because the company was
   focusing on fullscreen touch-friendly apps and design. It made
   navigating to this new Start screen very difficult. The Start screen
   itself was designed to look simplistic, but using it was anything but.
   Microsoft shipped the first version with the built-in apps pinned by
   default, but no quick access to search or shutdown options. It confused
   longtime Windows users and proved difficult to learn for new users, and
   was largely considered too much of a change from the Start menu that
   existed before.

   Most of the changes to the Start menu were related to Live Tiles. These
   new tiles were designed to promote a new type of app that developers
   could build. The new "Metro-style" apps ran fullscreen and were mainly
   designed to be finger-friendly to position Windows 8 as a tablet /
   desktop operating system. Apps used Live Tiles that stood out on the
   new Start screen, but it made it more difficult to find the traditional
   desktop apps that Windows users were accustomed to working with. The
   traditional desktop was designed to be just another app, with the Start
   screen taking control of the entire interface.

   With the desktop as an "app," that meant the taskbar was also hidden
   away by default. Most Windows users had grown used to finding the date
   and time in the lower left-hand side of their screen, but this
   disappeared unless you hovered your mouse to the four hot corners
   Microsoft created. It was difficult to navigate, and it was clear that
   most Windows 8 users just wanted the Start menu back. Some got used to
   it, but many downloaded third-party apps to bring back the familiar
   Start menu; 1.5 million people downloaded a Start menu replacement in
   just a few months from the launch of Windows 8, signalling that
   Microsoft had more work to do to make people happy with its new Start
   screen.
   "Windows 8 trashed the Start menu and introduced the Start screen"

   Faced with negative feedback from the introduction of Windows 8,
   Microsoft was forced to address some of it with its Windows 8.1 update.
   The Start screen persisted, but Microsoft added shutdown and search
   options, and brought back the familiar Start button in the lower
   left-hand side. There was a small visual pointer to scroll downwards to
   access a list of all apps, but the Start screen still wasn't a popular
   option for most Windows users.

   It still felt like the desktop was hidden underneath this new
   touch-friendly interface, and many still found it difficult to find.

   Windows 10 was really designed to keep the good aspects of Windows 8,
   but bring back some of the familiarity of Windows 7. Microsoft listened
   to the feedback this time, but instead of just bringing back the old
   Start menu from Windows 7, the software maker took the old menu and
   merged it together with its new Live Tiles. The Tiles serve as a
   colorful and large canvas to launch or pin favorite apps on the right
   hand-side, and the left keeps quick access to shutdown options,
   settings, all apps, and the familiar most used apps column.

   Microsoft moved the visual search elements of the Start menu down into
   the taskbar, but you can still type to search in the Windows 10 Start
   menu and it's all part of the same interface. Microsoft's Cortana
   digital assistant now sits in the taskbar alongside the Start menu and
   a new Task View option for a quick view of open apps and virtual
   desktops. All these changes were designed with desktop and laptop users
   in mind, and to make everything a lot more familiar and easier to use
   at the same time.

   If you're coming from Windows 7 and you upgrade to Windows 10, it's far
   less jarring than the Windows 8 Start screen experience. Microsoft
   tried to push a touch-friendly UI in Windows 8, but it has clearly
   retreated back to the familiarity of the desktop.

   The overall interface in Windows 10 is a mix of black and white in most
   areas. Built-in apps make use of this design the most, but the taskbar
   and Start menu mix a black theme with touches of transparency. Windows
   10 was released more than six months ago, and it appears that most
   Windows users are happy that the Start menu is back with a fresh design
   and new features.

   The Start menu appears to be back with a vengeance, and this time, it's
   here to stay.
