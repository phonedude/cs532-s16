MySpace Still Exists, Parent Company Sells Social Network's Remains To
Time Inc.

   By [27]Mary Beth Quirk February 11, 2016

   [28]Screen Shot 2016-02-11 at 1.07.25 PM Prepare to transport yourself
   back to 2003, kids, before Facebook, when a profile meant a list of
   your Top 5 friends and a flashy, custom design, and MySpace ruled the
   social media realm (Friendster, sit down). Apparently, it still exists
   today, and Time Inc. now owns what's left of it.

   Parent company [29]Viant sold MySpace -- now dedicated to music and
   videos, though users still have profiles and a list of "top" friends --
   to the magazine publisher behind People, Sports Illustrated, and Time,
   among others (h/t [30]Associated Press).

   The price wasn't disclosed, but Viant promises it can give marketers
   access to more than 1.2 billion users.

   In 2008, the AP notes, MySpace boasted 76 million U.S. visitors before
   Facebook pushed it out of public favor. Justin Timberlake and some
   other investors [31]bought it in 2011 from News Corp. for $35 million.
