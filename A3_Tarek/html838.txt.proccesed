The best way to get to single-digit body fat

   Are you finding a six-pack hard to come by? Bring it out with these
   tips

   [65]Men's Health By [66]Men's Health Posted on February 10, 2016

   Obtaining the coveted single-digit percentage of body fat is a lonely
   path to walk, reserved for bodybuilders, superhero actors and the truly
   dedicated. If you're looking for jaw-dropping abs to go along with your
   gains, it's going to be tough. So how do bodybuilders drop themselves
   to that level?

   [67](Related: how to eat like a bodybuilder)

Carb smart

   The latest nutritional guidelines have shown that [68]fat is in and
   carbs are out for a while now, but many are stuck on the old staple
   that carbs are necessary before a gym sesh. Dead wrong if you're
   gunning for single digits.

   "People need to get it out of their heads that fat makes you fat," says
   pro PT Jason Patmore. "Carbohydrates release insulin, and when insulin
   levels are raised the body is actually prevented from using fat as
   fuel. The goal is to reduce your body to that state."

   Cutting body fat means training your body to use fat stores as fuel,
   something it won't be doing while you're burning through pre-workout
   pasta. Patmore recommends a high-protein breakfast without carbs before
   hitting to the gym, only using carbs after training to improve the
   protein synthesis process - this is the reason most protein shakes have
   a mix of both protein and carbohydrates.

   Your session is going to suck because of the low energy reserves before
   your body adapts, but if you're set on that lonely number it'll all be
   worth it to watch the fat melt away. Eating your carbs later in the day
   is more beneficial in a low-calorie diet, as the journal Obesity
   (Silver Spring) has shown that carbs late in the day reduce hunger
   pangs and improve weight loss.

Myth buster

   One of the biggest body-fat myths around is that you can "spot reduce"
   fat by targeting certain body areas. For example, if you want six-pack
   abs, you'll be able to target subcutaneous fat (belly fat) specifically
   for faster results. But Patmore knows better.

   "Can you spot reduce?" He asks incredulously. "Your body will pile on
   or lose fat, but spot reducing is a myth. Certain areas of your body
   are more likely to store fat, so general fat loss will equate to losing
   flab in certain areas more than others." No targeting your double-chin,
   we're afraid: push through the pain and watch it melt away with the
   rest of your body.

Keep going

   Operating at a calorie deficit, carefully managing your carbs and
   harvesting fat-stores during workouts will begin to drag your body fat
   down below the decade. All that remains is to roll up your sleeves and
   get on with the workouts - and for this, Patmore recommends upper and
   lower-body supersets followed by a steady-state run.

   [70](Related: the HIIT dumbbell workout)

   The following supersets, 15 reps of each with 2 mins rest between
   supersets, should kick your fat-loss journey into overdrive. We'll see
   you on the cover of the mag next year.

   Superset 1:
     * Goblet squat: Stand with your legs slightly wider than
       shoulder-width apart, clasping a kettlebell in each hand in front
       of your chest with palms facing each other.
     * Bend your knees and lower yourself into a squat, keeping the
       kettlebells in the same position and ensuring you don't round your
       black by tensing your glutes throughout. Drive back up and
       repeat.

     * Dumbbell shoulder press: Sit on the bench holding two dumbbells at
       shoulder height with an overhand grip.
     * Press the weights up above your head until your arms are fully
       extended. Return slowly to the start position.

   Superset 2:

     * Dumbbell bench press: Lie on a flat bench holding two dumbbells
       over your chest with an overhand grip.
     * Push up until your arms are straight, then lower under control.

     * Dumbbell split squat: With a dumbbell in each hand, stand facing
       away from bench with one leg resting on it, laces down.
     * Squat down with your standing leg until the knee of your trailing
       leg almost touches the floor. Push up through your front foot to
       return to the start position.

   Follow that lot up with a steady state run at 65% intensity for 5km.
