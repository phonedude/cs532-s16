   Well, this yearâs Super Bowl has come and gone. As the hype of the
   funny commercials and the interesting halftime show dies down, thereâs
   one aspect of the game that still has many people talking â Cam
   Newtonâs now infamous postgame interview (if you can even call it
   that).

   Newton and the Carolina Panthers suffered a surprising loss to Peyton
   Manning and the Denver Broncos, something no professional athlete would
   be happy about. But Newtonâs abrupt departure from his interview after
   the game following a few half-assed answers shows what kind of player
   he really is.

   Refusing to talk to the media because youâve lost is nothing but bad
   sportsmanship. As a professional athlete, itâs part of your job to
   speak to the press, make public appearances and discuss games, whether
   youâve won or not.

   As this yearâs NFL Most Valuable Player, Newton needs to be the MVP at
   all times. Heâs responsible for being a leader both on and off the
   field, setting an example for his teammates and showing what being
   valuable is really about. Walking out of one of the biggest interviews
   of the season because heâs upset with the gameâs outcome just makes him
   look like a baby.

   Would his behavior have been different if the Panthers wouldâve won? I
   guarantee it.Â

   Yes, Iâm sure losing the Super Bowl sucks, especially coming off of a
   17-1 season leading up to the big game. But athletes need to be held
   accountable for their actions, and how you react when youâre not
   winning is just as important as how you act when you are. Newton,
   someone whoâs spent the entire season dancing and dabbing his way into
   everyoneâs hearts, let his emotions get the best of him and essentially
   threw a temper tantrum when he didnât get his way.

   Donât get me wrong â I wouldnât have expected him to be all smiles
   after the game. But I did expect him to pull himself together, answer
   the mediaâs questions and be a good sport, considering he seemed to be
   one all season long. The reason people are so upset is because, letâs
   face it, Newton isnât the first quarterback to lose the Super Bowl and
   he certainty wonât be the last. It comes with the territory of being a
   professional athlete in a league that centers around one very specific
   end goal.

   At the end of the day, Newton is a great player whoâll hopefully learn
   from this experience and come back next season better than ever. I just
   hope he can get a thicker skin and learn to handle himself better in
   times when it really counts.Â

   Itâs finally here. The 2016 NFL offseason is finally upon us and
   already we have non-news stories floating around the NFL. If for some
   reason you missed Americaâs biggest unofficial national holiday this
   past Sunday, the 17-1 top-seeded Carolina Panthers, along with MVP
   quarterback Cam Newton, fell from grace at the hands of the Denver
   Broncos and lost 24-10 in Super Bowl 50.Â

   After a game that was a showcase of the two most outstanding defenses
   in the NFL, Newton abruptly left his interview booth after three
   minutes and refused to speak further with reporters. What was the
   headline of Yahoo Sports the next day? âCam Newton goes from Superman
   to Incredible Sulk in poor postgame showing.â Are you kidding me? I
   guess reporters these days just canât give an athlete a break.

   This wasnât the only sports news outlet that had the same opinion on
   Newtonâs âprofessionalismâ either. âSportsCenterâ had five to 10-minute
   segments tallying the number of âno responsesâ or âignored questionsâ
   by Newton, then proceeded to criticize his character. This man just had
   one of the most electrifying seasons an NFL quarterback has ever had
   and was one game away from an undefeated regular season. The Panthers
   decisively beat almost every opponent in the playoffs before the first
   half was even over, and youâre upset because he wouldnât answer your
   question immediately after losing the biggest game of his life on
   national television?Â

   How highly do these reporters think of themselves? Try to imagine
   yourself in Newtonâs shoes. You just lost the Super Bowl and youâre
   stuck listening to the other team getting interviewed a few feet from
   your booth talking about how you couldnât throw the football. How would
   that make you feel? Would you want reporters in your face asking you
   questions about why certain things happened or what could you have done
   differently? Of course not. I would have gotten up and left too Cam.Â

   Reporters need to find the line between privacy and professionalism
   because, obviously, they have no idea what either of those words means.
   Could you ask him those questions later? Sure â but 10 minutes after
   losing the biggest game of his life, show the man some respect. Newton
   is a winner being treated like a loser. He had strong words to say
   later this week in response to his demeanor.Â

   âI hate losing. You show me a good loser and Iâll show you a loser,â
   Newton said.Â

   Heâs not going to change his competitiveness and nor should he, itâs
   what makes the NFL great. If reporters canât give athletes a pass for
   being human, we shouldnât give them a pass to judge.Â
