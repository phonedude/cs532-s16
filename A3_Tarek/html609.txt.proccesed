    THE ECHO CHAMBER

   David Byrne | February 01, 2016

   Not too long ago some friends were asking each other, "How are Trump
   supporters so seemingly unaware of his lies and bullshit, and the
   ridiculousness of many of his positions and ideas?" (His claim that he
   "watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of
   people were cheering" on 9/11 comes immediately to mind.) Lately it
   seems that anything that contradicts a passionate belief has become
   invisible.

   The avoidance of a "reality-based community"--as the [60]Bush advisors
   derisively called it--is truly puzzling, but the other reasons why
   folks are drawn to Trump and others like him are, in my opinion, pretty
   clear. One reason why folks on either side of the party line are angry
   with how things stand is that both sides sense that Congress is
   beholden to the money of special interests and consequently the voice
   of the people goes unheard. Democrats might blame the Koch brothers and
   I'm sure that conservatives blame some outside influences, too. The
   decision to bailout the banks doesn't sit right with some, and others
   feel that the government wants to regulate their private lives.

   The article [61]"Beyond Distrust: How Americans View Their Government",
   from which a lot of the figures in the BBC article were taken.

   According to a [62]study by Nobel Laureate Angus Deaton and Anne Case,
   white middle class men may be killing themselves due to an increase in
   pessimistic outlooks concerning their financial futures. My guess is
   that the middle class senses the end of the American dream and that
   white middle class Americans are experiencing a lack of mobility and
   opportunity in the economic spheres where they were previously the
   privileged and entitled majority.

   Graph from the Pew Research Center article, "Beyond Distrust: How
   Americans View Their Government", November 2015
   Americans feel disenfranchised--that the government isn't responsible
   to the people and instead only responds to the wishes of special
   interests. In my opinion, the latter is not just a feeling, it's true.
   Add to that the feeling of impotence--that traditional remedies and
   corrections aren't effective anymore--and you have a pretty explosive
   cocktail. This probably drives a lot of Sanders supporters, too, though
   my bias leads me to assume that Sanders isn't propagating outright lies
   and misconceptions--he's actually addressing issues and not simply
   massaging his ego and building his brand.

   That anger explains a lot, but the question still remains: how do folks
   continue to ignore facts? How have people's viewpoints become so
   insular and isolated that any contradictory information never even
   penetrates the bubble? How did we get to a point where dialogue is
   impossible? And I'm not just referring to this presidential race, but
   to many other areas of discussion as well. Am I imagining this or has
   the echo chamber, where one only hears what one agrees with, expanded
   in scope and at the same time had the effect of increasing that anger
   and the inability to have a dialogue?

   The workings of an echo chamber
   It's been suggested that social media has a big hand in this increase
   in insularity. By its nature, a social network is adept at creating
   in-groups that share similar likes and opinions. Like many people
   nowadays, followers of Trump (and other candidates) often get their
   news from social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook--which
   allows users to post articles and video from other sources. (TV is a
   big source of information, too, but then folks still gravitate to shows
   that project  familiar and agreeable point of views.) The problem with
   Facebook and Twitter is that those platforms mostly present a point of
   view that you already agree with, since you only see what your
   "friends" are sharing. We all do this to some extent--your friends
   share news with you and presumably many of your friends share your
   viewpoints. The algorithms built into those social networks are
   designed to reinforce this natural human tendency and expand upon
   it--if you like this, you'll like this. The networks reinforce your
   existing point of view in order to give you more of what you like, as
   that will make you happy and keep you on the network--and, in turn,
   more ads can be accurately targeted your way. You remain blissfully
   happy "knowing" or, rather, believing, more and more about less and
   less. Add that algorithm to folks' natural inclination to seek points
   of view that confirm existing biases and you've got a potent
   combination. Once you've surrounded yourself with only one point of
   view, soon that point of view is all you hear.

   That is why, a friend argued, Trump supporters are immune to criticism
   and to the exposure of his lies and false accusations: for the most
   part these algorithms and subsequent self-censorship make it so that
   they never see anything but what they already agree with. As often
   happens when groups of like-minded individuals discuss something, the
   result is that their points of view are not only reinforced but also
   become more extreme. Cass Sunstein describes this phenomena in her
   article, [63]"[64]Deliberative Trouble? Why Groups Go to Extremes[65]":

   Like-minded people engaged in discussion with one another may lead each
   other in the direction of error and falsehood, simply because of the
   limited argument pool and the operation of social influences. ... The
   point also bears on the design of deliberating courts, legislatures,
   and regulatory agencies. Above all, an understanding of group
   polarization helps explain why like-minded people, engaged in
   deliberation with one another, sometimes go to astonishing extremes and
   commit criminal or even violent acts.

   This is a natural human tendency, and social media seems to encourage
   it. By design. In order to keep the eyeballs happy and people on the
   site, the news is filtered--you get fed content on subjects and people
   you have previously expressed interest in. The algorithm uses that
   information to find more articles, images, etc., that pander to your
   likes. You are an increasingly happier viewer as you see more of what
   you like.

   Below is a selection from an [66]article in The Guardian by Iran's
   "blogfather", Hossein Derakhshan. His blogging was, some years ago,
   very effective as a voice of protest and resistance--so much so that he
   was imprisoned for six years and only recently released. But now he
   senses that the web landscape has changed and voices like his don't
   penetrate as much:

   Instagram - owned by Facebook - doesn't allow its audiences to leave
   whatsoever. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but it
   won't go anywhere. Lots of people start their daily online routine in
   these cul-de-sacs of social media, and their journeys end there. Many
   don't even realise they are using the internet's infrastructure when
   they like an Instagram photograph or leave a comment on a friend's
   Facebook video. It's just an app. But hyperlinks aren't just the
   skeleton of the web: they are its eyes, a path to its soul. And a blind
   webpage, one without hyperlinks, can't look or gaze at another webpage
   - and this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the
   web.

   Iran's "blogfather" Hossein Derakhshan
   Wael Ghonim, who is credited with helping to launch 2011's Tahrir
   Square revolution via his anonymous Facebook page, laments the state of
   things today via the New York Times article [67]"[68]Social Media:
   Destroyer or Creator?[69]":

   We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks
   to social media, we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else. Five
   years ago, I said, "If you want to liberate society, all you need is
   the Internet". Today I believe if we want to liberate society, we first
   need to liberate the Internet.

   We would like to think of the web at a place of pluralism--a place
   where many voices, often at odds with one another, can be heard. A
   place of diversity. A place to find out what wonderful and unexpected
   stuff exists that is different than anything and everything you already
   know. It seems that may have been true with net 1.0, but as market
   forces increasingly take effect, the diversity of voices, while it
   still exists, is now so filtered and targeted that  you may only hear
   echoes of what you already believe. It's human tendency--further
   complicated by the fact that doing so funnels lots of advertising
   dollars into the pockets of big corporations.

   [70]Here's a review in the New York Review of Books by Jacob Weisberg
   of some recent books on this and related phenomena. He writes:

   Some of Silicon Valley's most successful app designers are alumni of
   the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford, a branch of the university's
   Human Sciences and Technologies Advanced Research Institute. B.J. Fogg
   calls the field he founded "captology," a term derived from an acronym
   for "computers as persuasive technology." It's an apt name for the
   discipline of capturing people's attention and making it hard for them
   to escape. Fogg's behavior model involves building habits through the
   use of what he calls "hot triggers," like the links and photos in
   Facebook's newsfeed, made up largely of posts by one's Facebook
   friends.

   A successful app, [Nir Eyal] writes, creates a "persistent routine" or
   behavioral loop. The app both triggers a need and provides the
   momentary solution to it. "Feelings of boredom, loneliness,
   frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight
   pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often
   mindless action to quell the negative sensation," he writes.
   "Gradually, these bonds cement into a habit as users turn to your
   product when experiencing certain internal triggers."

   Facebook's trigger is FOMO, fear of missing out. The social network
   relieves this apprehension with feelings of connectedness and
   validation, allowing users to summon recognition.  ...checking in
   delivers a hit of dopamine to the brain, along with the craving for
   another hit. The designers are applying basic slot machine psychology.
   The variability of the "reward"--what you get when you check in--is
   crucial to the enthrallment.

   ISIS and other radical organizations take advantage of this web-based
   phenomena as well. They too target folks' passions--videogames, for
   example--and their frustrations. Many of their recruits were not
   previously angry or radical, but social media allows all sorts of
   entities--the good and the bad--to tap into our latent feelings. This
   [71]article in Teen Vogue describes just how ISIS uses social media to
   recruit American teens.

   ISIS propaganda
   So what can be done? The article [72]"[73]Terror on Twitter: How ISIS
   is taking war to social media-and social media is fighting
   back[74]" outlines some ways of mitigating the attraction of terrorist
   websites and ISIS's presence on the internet at large, including
   banning jihadist content and ISIS users, counter-recruiting via target
   advertising and hackathons, and gathering counter-intelligence from the
   outside and in.

   But that's just focusing on ISIS. What about local politics? Aren't
   issues of race and immigration similarly ramping up in the U.S. (and
   elsewhere) into intolerant screaming matches? How do you encourage
   tolerance and open-mindedness while promoting exposure to diversity of
   opinion? It's an old question... As Alexander Hamilton wrote in
   The Federalist Papers of 1788, "The differences of opinion, and the
   jarring of parties...often promote deliberation and circumspection, and
   serve to check excesses in the majority." Further to that point, from
   philosopher John Rawls:

   In everyday life the exchange of opinion with others checks our
   partiality and widens our perspective; we are made to see things from
   their standpoint and the limits of our vision are brought home to us.
   ... The benefits from discussion lie in the fact that even
   representative legislators are limited in knowledge and the ability to
   reason. No one of them knows everything the others know, or can make
   all the same inferences that they can draw in concert. Discussion is a
   way of combining information and enlarging the range of arguments.

   Easy for Hamilton and Rawls to say, and for Sunstein to advise
   similarly as to group decision making (i.e., allow for dissenting
   views, limit the power of the leader, etc.). But what about in our
   day-to-day lives? What about the folks who will never hear that Trump
   is full of shit when he says he self-finances his campaign? See no evil
   hear no evil.

   I'm probably as guilty as anyone, though I do scan about four to five
   different news sources during my daily browsing. While none of them are
   presented to me via a social media feed, the newspapers themselves are
   skewing more and more towards likable headlines, topics and subjects.
   Am I then supposed to force myself to read the Post and watch Bill
   O'Reilly from time to time?

   Seriously though, some of those news outlets do skew towards opinions
   that are not reinforcing my pre-existing beliefs (the Financial Times,
   for example). So perhaps I have tempered some of my knee jerk reactions
   in some issues. But still.

   I'm going to suggest that cycling or walking around in different
   neighborhoods gives one a slightly more face-to-face view of the
   diversity of humanity, especially here in New York. I love writing
   songs from different characters' points of view--characters who are
   often saying things I would never personally say, but whose shoes I can
   put myself, sometimes.

   Like most people, I gravitate to others who probably share many of my
   viewpoints... but not always. If it's not already been filtered and
   combed through, sometimes we discover that friends hold some surprising
   viewpoints. And because they're friends--or at least because I respect
   them--I'll take those ideas on board, for a little while at least.
