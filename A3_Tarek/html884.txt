But while being behind the scenes is fun, so is following along from the comfort of your own couch&amp;#8212;especially in the dead of winter. So juice up your phone, update your apps, and keep up with the best beauty looks with these insiders, who&#x27;ll be posting all week long. The Pros Pat McGrath, Makeup Artist Instagram: @patmcgrathreal, Snapchat: patmcgrathreal, Periscope: Pat McGrath A photo posted by Pat McGrath (@patmcgrathreal) on Sep 13, 2015 at 2:34pm PDT Fresh off the runaway success of her bespoke products, Gold 001 and Phantom 002, the legend&amp;#8217;s back for yet another season. The photos of McGrath&#x27;s colorful, out-of-the-box ideas are always the kind you want to print out and hang up for inspiration. Even if you wouldn&amp;#8217;t, say, paint cobalt splotches on your face, it might just convince you to try out bright blue liner. Val Garland, Makeup Artist Instagram: @thevalgarland, Periscope: Val Garland A photo posted by ValGarland (@thevalgarland) on Sep 23, 2015 at 3:22pm PDT The MAC celebrity makeup artist has been around for ages, and for good reason: Her work has this dreamy, otherworldly quality that&#x27;s all her own. Plus, she throws in weirdly cool details&amp;#8212;think fake freckles and a single gold line down the face&amp;#8212;that make the beauty look for every show she helms a fun surprise. Tom Pecheux, Makeup Artist Instagram: @tompecheux A photo posted by tompecheux (@tompecheux) on Sep 15, 2015 at 10:35am PDT Come to Pecheux&amp;#8217;s feed for beauty looks that are feminine and pretty&amp;#8212;more often they not, his models look like super-healthy, well-rested versions of themselves, with a brightly colored lip here and there. But no one will blame you if you get lost in his wanderlust-inducing travel shots. James Pecis, Hairstylist Instagram: @jamespecis A photo posted by James pecis (@jamespecis) on Sep 17, 2015 at 4:57pm PDT Editors chat up Pecis before shows to learn about the hair looks&amp;#8212;and also because he&#x27;s one of the coolest guys we know. But his work, which spans everything from loose, lived-in waves to updos impossible to recreate at home, speaks for itself. Madeline Poole, Nail Artist Instagram: @mpnails, Snapchat: mpnails, Periscope: mpnails A photo posted by Madeline Poole (@mpnails) on Sep 12, 2015 at 9:49am PDT Poole&amp;#8217;s nail art stands out because it&amp;#8217;s not like she pulls off the impossible. Well, sometimes she does, but much of it is DIY-able if you have a steady enough hand. Plus, she dreams up crazy new ways to apply nail polish (last season, it was with the head of a nail). Gucci Westman, Makeup Artist Instagram: @gucciwestman A photo posted by gucciwestman (@gucciwestman) on Sep 16, 2015 at 4:00pm PDT Westman can do a lot of things with makeup, but one of the best is what she does to skin first. She preps it with a sheet mask, sprinkles on a little unicorn dust, and makes it look dewy and flawless before even thinking about adding color. Her Instagram feed gives hints about how she does it (and, of course, other touches like bright fuchsia lips and graphic eyeliner). Katie Jane Hughes, Nail/Makeup Artist Instagram: @katiejanehughes, Snapchat: KatieJaneHughes, Periscope: katiejanehughes A photo posted by Katie Jane Hughes (@katiejanehughes) on Sep 10, 2015 at 11:41am PDT You know those people who seem to be good at everything? Hughes is one of them. On any given day, you can find her posting red carpet makeup looks she&amp;#8217;s recreated on herself. Her nail designs, though, are total originals&amp;#8212;last season, she created a look (above) she dubbed, &amp;#8220;fortunate accident mani.&amp;#8221; The Models Gigi Hadid Instagram: @gigihadid, Snapchat: itsgigihadid, Periscope: Gigi Hadid A photo posted by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Sep 13, 2015 at 6:36pm PDT An easier game to play would be where is Gigi not? She&amp;#8217;s going to be just about everywhere this season&amp;#8212;so follow her and you get what&amp;#8217;s kind of like a free pass into every cool show and after-party. And you don&amp;#8217;t even have to put on pants for them. Kendall Jenner Instagram: @kendalljenner, Snapchat: kendalljenner, Periscope: kendalljenner A photo posted by Kendall Jenner (@kendalljenner) on Sep 11, 2015 at 5:54pm PDT Jenner&amp;#8217;s bound to be just as ubiquitous as&amp;#8212;if not arm-in-arm with&amp;#8212;her bff Hadid. Sure, the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner fam will be there too (gotta support Ye or face his Twitter wrath, you know?) but she&amp;#8217;s the only one in the center of the action. Maria Borges Instagram: @iammariaborges, Snapchat: MariaBorges28 A photo posted by Maria Borges (@iammariaborges) on Sep 17, 2015 at 8:07am PDT Borges made hair history last year when she wore hers natural for the Victoria&amp;#8217;s Secret Fashion Show. Expect to see her gorgeous crop all over the runway this season, too. Imaan Hammam Instagram: @imaanhammam, Snapchat: imaanhammam A photo posted by Imaan Hammam (@imaanhammam) on Sep 20, 2015 at 7:01am PDT In a perfect world, Hammam would be our best friend. Her Instagram feed is a mix of behind-the-scenes sefies and gorgeous runway pics, and it&amp;#8217;s clear she doesn&amp;#8217;t take herself too seriously. Plus, her hair! Just try to look away. It&amp;#8217;s not possible. Herieth Paul Instagram: @heriethpaul A photo posted by Herieth? (@heriethpaul) on Feb 11, 2016 at 6:44am PST She&#x27;s the newest face of Maybelline&amp;#8212;meaning you know her beauty look is special&amp;#8212;and she&#x27;ll give you all sorts of #skingoals for days. The Fashion Week Staples Eva Chen, Head of Fashion Partnerships at Instagram Instagram: @evachen212, Snapchat: theevachen212, Periscope: Eva Chen A photo posted by Eva Chen (@evachen212) on Sep 12, 2015 at 10:12am PDT Chen&amp;#8217;s in charge of fashion partnerships for Instagram, so (lucky for the rest of us) it&amp;#8217;s literally her job to show up and post photos. Keep an eye out for her captivating slow-mo videos of cool details and peeks into the busy world backstage. Milk Studios Instagram: @milk, Snapchat: milk_made, Periscope: Milk A photo posted by Milk (@milk) on Sep 11, 2015 at 9:30am PDT Milk is a big player during NYFW (and, now with a new beauty line, all year round). It&#x27;s like an artists&#x27; hub: Designers have shows at the studios, creative types hang out there, and photographers snap cool, one-of-a-kind shots of the beauty looks. Natalie Suarez, Fashion Blogger Instagram: @natalieoffduty, Snapchat: natalieoffduty A photo posted by Natalie Suarez (@natalieoffduty) on Sep 15, 2015 at 8:35am PDT We love a fashion girl with a signature beauty look, and Natalie has that free-spirited, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll vibe down pat. She&#x27;s usually in the front row, or hanging with her sister, Dylana&amp;#8212;also a blogger, also one of our wavy hair crushes. The two are so cute that you&amp;#8217;ll want to start coordinating your Instagram posts with your own sister or best friend. Mark Leibowitz, Photographer Instagram: @marklphoto, Snapchat: marklphoto A photo posted by Mark Leibowitz (@marklphoto) on Sep 13, 2015 at 11:14am PDT Glamour&amp;#8217;s own longtime photographer (shout out!) catches relaxed, playful moments backstage (a feat, when you consider that everyone&#x27;s working 24/7). Check his feed for close-ups of details you might otherwise miss, like cool nail colors and a sprinkling of glitter. Julia Murphree, Beauty Publicist Instagram: @juliamurphree A photo posted by Julia Murphree ?????? (@juliamurphree) on Feb 17, 2015 at 8:51am PST Murphree is technically the executive director of U.S. public relations for Nars Cosmetics, but she could definitely moonlight as a photographer. She spends much of her time backstage scoping out the coolest makeup looks, and the resulting shots are anything but amateur. Harley Viera-Newton, DJ Instagram: @harleyvnewton, Snapchat: harleyvnewton A photo posted by Harley Viera-Newton (@harleyvnewton) on Sep 15, 2015 at 7:23am PDT It&amp;#8217;s the best of both worlds: Not only is Viera-Newton a front-row fixture, but she also DJs at after-parties during Fashion Week&amp;#8212;if you need going-out makeup and hair inspiration, she&#x27;s the one to look to. Us, of course! Lipstick Instagram: @get_lipstick A photo posted by Lipstick (@get_lipstick) on Sep 11, 2015 at 8:28pm PDT The Glamour beauty team will be backstage reporting, snapping, and uploading all the show-stopping looks at NYFW like its our job (because it kind of is). And the answer is yes&amp;#8212;it&#x27;s as awesome as it seems. Glamour Instagram: @glamourmag, Snapchat: glamourmag A photo posted by Glamour Magazine (@glamourmag) on Feb 11, 2016 at 9:18am PST And don&#x27;t forget our fashion team! Not only will they be capturing all of the great behind-the-scenes fashion moments (and spotlighting the most inspirational women in the fashion industry), they&#x27;ve got great hair and makeup to boot.

The photos of McGrath's colorful, out-of-the-box ideas are always the kind you want to print out and hang up for inspiration.
