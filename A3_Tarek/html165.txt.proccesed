   O n its face, it was just a lights show with some over-the-top
   theatrics, and a half-hearted intrasquad game involving one of the
   country's pre-eminent college basketball programs. There was little
   reason to believe that the 2014 edition of Big Blue Madness, the
   unofficial kickoff of the University of Kentucky basketball season held
   on Oct. 17 of that year, would be anything more than a chance for coach
   John Calipari to promote his team and his school's ample resources.
   Sure, the event was on ESPNU, and those Wildcats would go on to run
   through the regular season undefeated, reach the Final Four, and
   produce four lottery picks and another pair of second-round selections.
   And, of course, Big Blue Nation will eat up anything Wildcats-related.
   Rupp Arena was packed for the glorified scrimmage.
   Give it a few hours, and the event would become host to one of the more
   iconic viral moments in recent sports history. It had everything, minus
   an adorable animal acting like a human, that the Internet loves: high
   celebrity, and high failure. Complex spoke to players, journalists,
   entertainers and observers who were either at Rupp Arena that night, or
   would later closely observer what took place: Drake's infamous airball
   at Big Blue Madness.

   Jerry Tipton, basketball writer, Lexington Herald-Leader: For Kentucky,
   it's kind of a holiday where generally the football team is not doing
   very well. Attention is turning to basketball, which is something of a
   year-round pre-occupation.

   Tod Lanter, UK player, 2012-15: It's become quite a spectacle. My dad
   played at Kentucky in `82. That was actually the first year Kentucky
   started doing madness. He was talking about how back then it was in the
   old arena and they just kind of said your name on the loudspeaker and
   walked out and waved to the crowd...Nowadays it's turned into a
   theatrical performance where we've got music and lights and
   pyrotechnics and all of this stuff.

   Devin Booker, UK player, 2014-15: It was one of the best moments that I
   had experienced. Big Blue Madness as a whole would have to be top
   three. It is when you can see how powerful Big Blue Nation actually
   is.

   Ben Roberts, recruiting writer, Lexington Herald-Leader: It's a circus,
   is what it is.
   Matt Jones, host, Kentucky Sports Radio: I think that year in
   particular--the only one bigger was the John Wall year.
   Indeed, the nature of that year's team only added to the luster of the
   evening. The 2013-14 team had a disappointing regular season, but made
   a surprise run to the NCAA championship game, losing to Connecticut.
   Matt Jones: You had two things: There was the combination of a team
   that had just gone to the NCAA Tournament final, and had a good chunk
   of it back. That doesn't happen in Kentucky. It's very rare that guys
   come back. You had with the Harrison twins and Willie Cauley-Stein, key
   pieces to a team that had gone to a championship game, returning...And
   then you throw in the fact that Karl[-Anthony] Towns was considered the
   No. 1 or 2 ranked player in the country coming in and a group that was
   highly recruited, but not quite a superstar class. It turned out to be
   a superstar class...I think honestly a big part of why that one was so
   big was [the chance of Kentucky going] 40-0.
   Lanter: I'm not going to say we expected to go 40-0, because it's
   nearly impossible. We didn't think there was anybody in the country
   that could touch us on a game-by-game basis.

     "That was the least cool thing he possibly could have done."
     --Bomani Jones

   Regardless, the promise of the team was not going to do all of the
   selling. Big Blue Madness doubles as Kentucky's biggest recruiting
   event, with many possible future Wildcats in attendance. The evening
   had always been a show, but since his arrival in 2009, Calipari has
   taken it up several notches. Enter Drake, the Toronto-area rapper with
   some subtle ties to the University of Kentucky. Drake is friendly with
   William "Worldwide Wes" Wesley (shouted out on the Grammy nominated
   track "Back to Back"), a consultant for CAA, the agency that represents
   Calipari. Drake has frequently credited Calipari with encouraging him
   to get his high-school diploma, and he received a custom championship
   ring in honor of Kentucky's 2012 title run.

   Patrick Patterson, UK player, 2007-10: I had the honor and privilege to
   have met [Drake] in college when I was with John [Wall] and DeMarcus
   [Cousins] and Eric [Bledsoe] and all of them. That's when it pretty
   much kicked off for him, his love for Kentucky. He and Calipari are
   extremely close.

   Sam Malone, UK player, 2011-15: I think it was 100 percent coach Cal
   and coach Cal's personality. The way coach Cal does things drew Drake
   toward him. He has that type of personality that can attract
   superstars...Coach Cal is a superstar. He's big time. Just as much as a
   college coach, he's a celebrity. People on the top, they tend to
   gravitate toward each other. Coach Cal was on the top of college
   basketball. Drake was on the top of rap. It was a good match.

   Matt Jones: I think [recruiting] was a huge part of [their
   relationship] when they initially met. Then I think Cal actually
   started to like him. I think they've actually become legitimate
   friends, which I know makes people laugh.

   Steve Jones, recruiting writer, [Louisville] Courier-Journal: I
   remember him out on the court after that charity-alumni game before the
   [2013-14] season, the season before, that's what I'm thinking, when
   Julius Randle would have been a freshman on the team. They had all of
   these NBA guys come back and play in an alumni game. I think Drake was
   one of the celebrity coaches for one of the teams there.

   POST CONTINUES BELOW

   Drake established his UK fandom before 2014 Big Blue Madness. According
   to Matt Jones, he followed the Wall-Cousins team to Syracuse for the
   regionals in 2010. He would pop up frequently in the years that
   followed. If you take Drake at his word, he has [27]"always" been a
   Kentucky fan. Now, it was time for Calipari to capitalize on his bond
   with the superstar.

   Lanter:  I think the rumors might have been what sparked him being
   there to begin with. UK fans were tweeting at him and whatnot, asking
   him if he was going to make an appearance because he had been courtside
   for the Final Four game the year before. I think it was more the fans
   trying to hype the situation up a little bit. There had never been, at
   least to my knowledge, plans of him being there before those rumors
   started going on. They actually squashed them saying that there was a
   concert out of town and he had something booked that day and wouldn't
   be able to make it. I don't know if that was told to the fans to get
   them to back off of expecting that so that it could be a surprise or he
   made some moves to schedule it to make it that day. They never really
   explained it to us.

   Matt Jones: The day before, UK folks were saying he wasn't [coming], I
   think to get it out of people's minds. I had a buddy [with knowledge of
   private planes flying in and out of Lexington], and he said, "Hey,
   Drake just landed." An hour or two before he was there, I heard he was
   coming. I tweeted it out. And then it kind of circulated.

   Trey Lyles, UK player, 2014-15: Guys were saying that he was supposed
   to come. And then we were hearing that he wasn't going to be coming. He
   walked in right before I walked in. He got there right as my bus was
   pulling up. Seeing that was pretty cool.

   Booker: We were very excited, not many other teams get the opportunity
   to get one of the best rappers of all time to come into their locker
   room. It's great to have built a relationship with him since then as
   well.

   Willie Cauley-Stein, UK player, 2012-15: He came into the locker room
   and he's rocking all the OVO gear and we were like, "Damn, let me get
   some of that OVO gear, blah, blah, blah."

   Malone: If I can remember correctly, he met us in the locker room.
   Coach Cal did his pre-game talk to us in our film room, which is the
   same thing we do before playing any other opponent or anything like
   that. He gave us his pre-season talk. And Drake was [28]sitting down
   amongst us like he was one of the players.

   It was not the most memorable Drake faux-pas of the night, but a
   picture with Drake sitting in the Kentucky locker room, in Wildcats
   warm-up gear, made the rounds on the Internet.

   Lanter: In that picture you're talking about, I was sitting right over
   his shoulder. It was pretty cool to listen to one of Cal's pre-game
   speeches--quote-unquote pre-game speeches--with Drake sitting there
   alongside us.

   Lyles: We weren't really watching video. Coach was just talking to us.
   He was actually sitting next to me. He didn't say much. He was just
   sitting there. In the picture it looked like he was paying attention,
   but I don't know if he was listening to anything [Calipari] was saying.

     "He had a look in his eye
     that was like, `What did I
     get myself into?'"
     --Sam Malone

   Even with Drake in the the team's locker room, only a very select group
   of people knew what his role would be that night.

   Booker: It was really surprising that Drake warmed up with us. We
   thought he was there just to perform and spend time with us. When he
   actually got in the layup line it was really funny to see.

   Malone: There's a long hallway that goes from the locker room to the
   floor. I remember going through that locker room and Drake was talking
   a little to us, talking about some stuff back and forth. As soon as we
   started walking that long hallway, it looked like he was visibly
   nervous to step out on the court.

   Lanter: He was out of his element. As crazy as that sounds to say, our
   guys play on a stage in front of millions of people, with the spotlight
   on, ESPN cameras rolling. I bet if you handed them a mic and walked
   them out on stage at a hip hop concert where Drake is performing,
   alongside him, they'd be nervous, too. I think Drake might have known
   that whatever he was about to do on that court, it was probably going
   to be on ESPN, whether it was Top 10 or Not Top 10. I can understand
   why he was probably nervous.

   Despite the early miss, Drake stayed in the layup line.

   Malone: I was on the opposite side of the court. I remember somebody
   right before him did a crazy dunk.

   Matt Jones: The way that would happen, and this happened a lot but
   especially during Big Blue Madness, is the guys would start to do
   dunks...And then usually the walk-ons made up for not being able to
   dunk by shooting the craziest layup attempt. I always thought Drake did
   not want to be one of the walk-ons that couldn't dunk, but also, he
   couldn't dunk.

   Lanter: Drake knew he couldn't follow a dunk with a layup, I guess.

   Patterson: You've got to start up with some layups and free throws and
   then work your way up to the three.

   Lanter: I had actually gotten the person's rebound who had just shot.
   ... I had gotten the rebound and thrown it back [to Drake].

   Lyles: I was the one rebounding [Drake's shot], so I definitely
   remember it.

   Drake caught the pass, asked `What am I supposed to do?' to nobody in
   particular, and launched a three-pointer (although his foot might have
   been on the arc).

   Matt Jones: He took that shot to try to be the equivalent of the guy
   dunking.

   Malone: He had a look in his eye that was like, `What did I get myself
   into?' Then the airball came. It was just funny. He was laughing.

   Lanter:  I knew it was worth noting. When he airballed it, we kind of
   started laughing and laughed it off and high-fived...It might have been
   my [pass] that caused his airball.

   Booker: I thought he would be able to at least shoot a little bit since
   all over his Instagram he's playing basketball, and I know he's a huge
   fan.

   Matt Jones: I was sitting right under the goal. I took a picture of his
   shot, and his form was ridiculous. That picture became the GIF file
   that exists of him--it was from that picture. He has his hand all up,
   and it's really odd-looking. All I could think of was, `That's a great
   picture.' I secondarily noticed that it didn't hit anything. All of the
   people sitting in the lower seats were kind of giggling. There's so
   much stuff going on. The arena as a whole didn't see it all. The UK
   players, I know this, were kind of giggling. Willie Cauley-Stein, who
   knew him a little more because he'd been there for three years, was
   kind of clowning him a little bit when he did that.

   Cauley-Stein: I started laughing a little bit but then after he
   airballed, I was like, "Get this guy off the court. Give him the mic.
   Give him the mic."

   Kevin Hart, comedian: Drake SUCKS! Shot an airball in front of a
   thousand people.

   Lyles: It was pretty funny. I was laughing.

   Lanter: [Nobody gave him a hard time] that I recall. Definitely not in
   the moment. I don't think anybody gave him a hard time. We shoot
   airballs in warm-ups. It's not surprising in that type of a situation,
   and that type of a crowd, somebody would shoot an airball. Not to
   mention there was all kinds of smoke in the air from the theatrics that
   had just happened before our layup lines. Let's just say that he
   couldn't see the goal. Let's roll with that. Maybe we can get him a
   pass.

     "Drake SUCKS! Shot an
     airball in front of a
     thousand people."
     --Kevin Hart

   As big of a moment as it would become online, not everybody in Rupp
   Arena remembers [31]seeing the shot.

   Roberts: I could have been up there typing something or looking around
   at something else. I don't remember the shot. I was sitting with
   people, and I don't even remember anybody playing it up. I went home,
   and the next day people are talking about this airball. And I said,
   "What do you mean, airball?"

   Steve Jones: I don't think I mentioned it in the story that I wrote. I
   think I remember in retrospect thinking that I should have put that in
   my story. It became somewhat of a memorable thing.

   Tipton: There may have been some chuckling about how inept he seemed as
   a basketball player. Then we moved on to other things. It wasn't
   dwelled on.

   Of course, it blew up on the Internet. Social media ate up the videos
   and photos, creating meme after meme after meme. Drake even [32]posted
   something on Instagram.

   Matt Jones: My Twitter exploded. It's only exploded like that one other
   time, which was during the Rick Pitino-Karen Seifert [sexual assault]
   trial. It exploded. I was just seeing it everywhere.

   Malone: I knew it had been overhyped and blown out of proportion.

   Steve Jones: I can totally see how that's a classic, in this day and
   age of social media, viral tweet, Vine candidate. It's a big celebrity
   on a very famous basketball team. Both fans of that team and fans who
   hate that team would both get a kick out of it. UK fans love that he
   loves them. Fans who don't like UK probably love that he looked
   foolish...while he was playing there.

   Matt Jones: I've been on the Internet long enough that I know what the
   Internet likes. Once I saw that people were taking that picture, and
   photoshopping it into historical events, I could tell it had blown up,
   sort of like the Michael Jordan crying face. It had reached that level
   where I was going to see it for a long time. And then there were
   pictures from that night that UK released. The other picture was of him
   in the film room, him watching film. I know Bomani {Jones} in
   particular thought that was hilarious. I could just tell Drake at Big
   Blue Madness was becoming a thing.

   Bomani Jones, ESPN radio & TV personality: First of all, what the hell
   is he doing in the layup line? This is just taking it a step too far. I
   understand that you want to kick it with the team. But what are you
   doing in the layup line? I've always said about Drake: Most people, if
   they had the access he does, would do a lot of the same things that he
   does. He's a fan and he does fan things. That Kentucky thing, when he
   was in the tunnel and then he was in the layup line and then we saw the
   picture of him in the film room, like he was really taking notes on the
   film. It was like, "Nah, nah, nah. If you're going to do all of that,
   you've got to hit the rim."
   [DrakeAirball36_2_rowof6.jpg ] Image via USA TODAY Sports/Mark Zerof

   The embarrassing moment did not sour the relationship. What's the big
   deal, anyway? LeBron and Melo occasionally miss everything. Although
   multiple people said Drake did not return to Lexington during the
   season, he was at the Final Four in Dallas, and a projection of him
   introducing Calipari was part of this past year's Big Blue Madness.

   Lyles: The whole year, he was posting Kentucky pictures, wishing us
   luck, telling us good luck. It was a cool thing for all of us. A lot of
   us, me personally, we listen to his music, we follow him and do all of
   that kind of stuff. For him to be interactive with us, it was a really
   cool thing.

   Bomani Jones: One thing that I think gets forgotten from watching a lot
   of NCAA basketball is that regular people shoot airballs fairly
   regularly. It's not like they shoot an airball 50 percent of the time.
   But if you go somewhere and play pickup basketball, it's not a terrible
   shot when someone puts up a shot and it's an airball. These things
   happen. There is certainly a human element to that. But that's why most
   of us don't play basketball in front of an audience.

   Patterson: Hey, we've all airballed a three some time. I've airballed a
   three in a game before. It's all good.

   Lanter: He was there cheering alongside us. We [had] met him before
   [that night]. But he was actually dressed in our sweats, going through
   warm-ups with us. It was a little bit surreal.

   Bomani Jones: I'm fascinated by the idea that this guy is No. 1 in the
   rap game. There have always been rules for a guy like Drake. It's just
   odd that he is the guy. It's very interesting that the No. 1 rapper
   isn't really that cool. That was the least cool thing he possibly could
   have done--go out there and shoot an airball...It is another part of
   the tapestry that is Drake.
