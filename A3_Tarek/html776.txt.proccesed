Turn your iPad in to a second display for your Mac or Windows machine

   By Steve, on July 12th, 2015

   I'm used to using my large 27 inch iMac at home, I rarely use
   applications full screen though, you start to suffer from moving your
   head from left to right, like you are watching a tennis match on Centre
   Court!! So I tend to divide the screen between two apps at a time. Mail
   and Skype, or Safari and Twitter etc.

   Quite often I will drag a tab out of Safari and sit it next to the
   other Safari window, so I have the two side by side. I can see both
   that way. I can place the mouse cursor in one Safari window, whilst the
   flashing on-screen cursor is in the other and happily copy links from
   one window with the mouse and paste them in the other with a key stroke
   without having to change the active window, it just works brilliantly
   for that simple function.

   I'm writing this post whilst away from home on my Macbook Pro, the same
   resolution screen as I have at home, but smaller screen size. Resizing
   windows to fit two side by side isn't so practical on a 13 inch screen,
   but with a simple app I have gained a second display using my iPad.

   My iPad isn't particularly new, it's the 3rd generation one, but with
   the [24]Duet App loaded it functions as a second display when connected
   via the USB cable to the Macbook Pro.

   The app lets you configure the screen resolution to use on the iPad
   separately to your main display, which side of your main display the
   iPad is stood on and a few other features.

   Even on my old iPad there is no detectable lag or delay in the cursor
   movement, the second display acts just like it is the main display. If
   you press the home key on the iPad to come out of the app, any windows
   or apps you had placed on the iPad screen are moved back on to the main
   screen without having to close them or reopen them.

   It apparently works with Windows machines as well, although I've not
   been able to test it with one as I don't have any Windows machines
   these days.

   So if you have a spare iPad you aren't sure what to do with it... turn
   it in to a second display for your laptop or even your Mac or PC at
   home.

       I wonder if this works for a Samsung Galaxy Tab.

            Hi Alan,
            I'm sure there might be an Android equivalent out there
            somewhere, but I'm not aware of one.

       Only slightly related - I hope to travel very light on vacation
       this summer, but about half-way through I need to do about half a
       day's work. I plan to take my Samsung tablet, with the bluetooth
       keyboard and bluetooth mouse - making it a mobile computer for
       under a kilo.
