   For the first time, carnival in Brazil has been characterized by
   popular campaigns on social networks demanding respect for women,
   clarifying the difference between flirtation and harassment, and even
   providing men with step-by-step instructions on how "not to be a
   sleaze".

   Reports of sexual harassment have already emerged from Rio, São Paulo
   and Salvador, where 461 cases of violence against women were registered
   by the municipal authorities.

   For the first time, carnival in Brazil has been characterized by
   popular campaigns demanding respect for women.

   On Saturday afternoon, S.F., 16, was resting on a bench with a friend
   during a parade in Ipanema, Rio, when they were approached by two men.

   "They started to touch us, asking "What are the two of you doing
   sitting here if you don't want to do anything?" said the student.

   Other men appeared, who appeared to be part of the same group. "One of
   them, who was very tall and strong, gave me a hard slap on my neck and
   I fell down. There's not much you can do about it, because we report it
   but nothing ever happens. Everyone thinks it's normal, because at
   carnival anything goes. I've always loved carnival, but this year I
   just felt very sad," she said.

   A few weeks before the event, the magazine AzMina launched the campaign
   #CarnavalSemAssédio (#CarnivalWithoutHarassment), in partnership with
   the Rio-based feminist carnival group Mulheres Rodadas and others. The
   aim was to teach men how to behave respectfully towards women in the
   parades.

   The group launched a pamphlet describing various types of harassment,
   such as pulling women's hair and grabbing their arms in order to hurt
   them.

   Nana Queiroz, 30, executive-director of AzMina, said that this is the
   first carnival in which the issue of harassment has been confronted so
   explicitly by society.
