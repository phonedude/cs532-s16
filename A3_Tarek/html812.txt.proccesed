   My main feeling when [242]first watching this fox struggle to
   understand the difference between two common white substances -- snow
   and cotton / poly blend fabrics -- was that I wanted this fox very
   badly. I shouldn't have this fox, because I live in a small apartment
   and foxes pee on stuff for no reason. They also suffer the "October
   crazies," according to this fox's owner. I have no idea what that
   means, but I assume it entails me getting bitten by a fox.

   But if I can't have this fox, at least I can help this fox. I feel very
   strongly that someone should explain the difference between sheets and
   snow to this poor dear so that she can get on with her life. As you can
   see, it's a field of study that she really struggles in.

   Maybe that person should be me?

   Dear fox,

   If you're reading this, how?

   If you're reading this, congrats.

   If you're reading this, you've honestly done enough for today and might
   not want to exert yourself further. That's okay. Learning about what
   sheets and snow are can wait for another day.

   However, I assume that a fine creature like yourself prefers not to be
   the subject of prolonged ridicule, and I have to break it you, fox --
   people are watching you and laughing. I don't say that to be harsh,
   it's just the truth. My mother and I had a similar conversation after I
   auditioned for my high school's production of 42nd Street. It is oft
   better to know where we stand.

   The truth is that snow is one thing, and sheets are another. Snow is
   often outside, and sheets are not. That is, unless someone has tracked
   snow inside with their boots / paws, or unless someone's damp sheets
   have been hung outside to become less damp.

   Don't look at me like that, there are exceptions to just about every
   rule. It's not my fault.

   If you look carefully, snow is tiny crystals of frozen water. Sheets
   are not that, and never will be. Unless someone is referring to a
   "sheet of ice," which is merely a turn of phrase. I know you won't be
   fooled, smart cookie that you are.

   Please stop peeing on the floor.

   Things are what they are, and they are not other things. Just like you
   are a fox, and I am a girl, and we are not friends, and you will never
   come live with me.

   I have accepted that, fox.

   So please accept that sheets are sheets, and snow is snow, and you can
   have both, because the world is your oyster. But you can't just go
   around not knowing which is which.

   Thank you, that is all.

   Also, I love you.
