   Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked the
   Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) to "urgently investigate the conduct of
   lawyers to the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, for walking out on the
   Code of Conduct Tribunal on Thursday.

   The tribunal had refused their application for stay of proceedings in
   the asset falsification trial against the Senate President.

   SERAP said that "It is the role of Sakari's lawyers to serve their
   client's best interests but in doing so they should not act in a manner
   that would put the administration of justice and the society's
   confidence in the judicial system and the fight against corruption at
   risk."

   In a statement Thursday by SERAP executive director, Adetokunbo Mumuni,
   the organisation said that, "walking out on the Code of Conduct
   Tribunal for simply and correctly applying section 305(e) of the newly
   enacted Administration of Criminal Justice Act is disrespectful.

   "SERAP believes that a lawyer's duty to the court is a fundamental
   obligation that defines a lawyer's role within the adversarial system.
   Lawyers should at all times act to promote the rule of law and the
   public's confidence in the administration of justice and not to be seen
   to undermine it or facilitate an infringement of the law.

     "As we have seen many times, without the rule of law, the rule of
     the jungle takes hold and the economically and socially vulnerable
     fall victim to the strong and nobody is safe. The rule of law also
     creates a disincentive for would-be corrupt officials. Senior
     lawyers especially have a responsibility to act as the guardians of
     the rule of law by contributing to a strong judicial and legal
     system which is crucial to a well-functioning democracy and which in
     turn is necessary to satisfactorily prevent and combat years of
     official corruption in the country. If at all Saraki's lawyers are
     dissatisfied with the ruling of the Tribunal, there are laid down
     processes that they should have followed to demonstrate their role
     as officers in the temple of justice rather than granting media
     interviews and literally abusing the Tribunal. We urge the NBA to
     urgently investigate what exactly happened and to punish any
     professional misconduct that may have occurred."
