   There's one type of marker that you may have passed right by in the
   woods without giving it a second thought.

   As KETK [34]reports, however, ignoring this one particular warning sign
   - even by virtue of just not knowing what it means - can land you at
   risk with the law, or worse.

   Reaching as far back as 1989 in Arkansas, the "Purple Paint Law" lets
   landowners use the color to mark the boundaries of their land, and is
   tantamount to a "no trespassing" sign in the eyes of the law.

   Across the U.S., at least 10 states have such laws on the books,
   including Texas, as land owner and broker Jonathan Kennedy
   [37]explains:

     "The reason the Texas legislature did that is they were trying to
     keep landowners from constantly having to replace signs. In Texas as
     we know, people like to take target practice at signs so they are
     having to replace them frequently."

   As a more economical and practical way to [38]mark property boundaries,
   the paint must be "readily visible to any person approaching the
   property," and can be placed on fence posts or trees.

   While purple seems to be the most widely used color for the law -
   likely because it [39]stands out in a natural setting and isn't already
   used by the foresting industry - other states allow orange or even lime
   green paint to symbolize the same thing.

   These states [40]include:
     * Illinois
     * Missouri
     * North Carolina
     * Maine
     * Florida
     * Idaho
     * Arkansas
     * Montana
     * Arizona
     * Kansas

   So next time you're hunting, fishing, or hiking, keep an eye out for
   these brightly-colored markings, or you may find yourself up against an
   angry land owner or even slapped with a first-degree trespassing
   charge.
