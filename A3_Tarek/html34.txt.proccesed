SETRA and Social Emotional Research

   February 11, 2016 By [49]Karen Effrem [50]1 Comment

   20167-0126-DataMining-Psych-Web-3

   Although there are [51]several major problems with the reauthorization
   of the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) now called The
   Strengthening Research Through Education Act (S 227, SETRA), the most
   pressing and concerning is the expansion of federal education research
   to psychologically profile our children beginning in preschool:

   Section 132 of the bill (page 28, line 16-21) inserts the following:

     "and which may include research on social and emotional
     learning, and the acquisition of competencies and skills, including
     the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, evaluate
     evidence, and communicate effectively..." (Emphasis added).

   Here are more of the many concerns:

   1)  Lack of Constitutionality - The federal government has no
   constitutional authority (Tenth Amendment) to be involved in education,
   much less doing research and collecting data on the attitudes, beliefs,
   and behaviors of our innocent children.  The Fourth Amendment to the US
   Constitution says:

     "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
     papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
     seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but
     upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
     particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or
     things to be seized." (Emphasis added).

   Having the federal government sanction and fund psychological profiling
   of children is the worst kind of privacy invasion.

   2) Subjectivity These parameters are admitted even by experts in the
   field to be extraordinarily subjective and difficult to define and
   measure.  There is still no agreement about their meaning or even their
   selection over a period of ten years:

   Challenges Involved in Infant and Early Childhood Diagnosis
     *  "Diagnostic classifications for infancy are still being developed
       and validated..."
     * "Lack of longitudinal outcome studies"
     * "Broad parameters for determining socioemotional outcomes are not
       clearly defined" (National Center for Infant and Early Childhood
       Health Policy [52]Addressing Social Emotional Development and
       Infant Mental Health in Early Childhood Systems 2005 (Emphasis
       added)

   Engage the Community in Collectively Defining SEL Standards

     The process of collectively defining standards provides a great way
     to address the first two pitfalls. Developing collective standards
     and engaging all stakeholders in the process of constructing the
     standard help to ensure that everyone understands and supports the
     implementation of the learning standards.  - [53]Social and
     Emotional Learning Research Review: Avoiding Pitfalls 12/1/2015

   Here are some quotes from leading researchers in the field cautioning
   against using these measures for accountability reported
   by [54]Education Week:

     Or, as researchers [55]Angela Duckworth and David Yeager put it in a
     May essay "perfectly unbiased, unfakeable, and error-free measures
     are an ideal, not a reality..."

     "...Current data and theory suggest schools that promote personal
     qualities most-and raise the standards by which students and
     teachers at that school make comparative judgments-may show the
     lowest scores and be punished, whereas schools that are least
     effective may receive the highest scores and be rewarded
     for ineffectiveness," they wrote.

   This is analogous to the difficulty of making accurate diagnoses and
   predictions in the realm of psychiatry, and especially in child
   psychiatry:

     At present, most psychiatric disorders lack validated diagnostic
     biomarkers, and although considerable advances are being made in the
     arena of neurobiology, psychiatric diagnoses are still mostly based
     on clinician assessment.|| (Jeste, D (President of the American
     Psychiatric Association) The New DSM Reaches the Finish
     Line [56]Huffington Post 12/11/12.

     Childhood and adolescence being developmental phases, it is
     difficult to draw clear boundaries between phenomena that are part
     of normal development and others that are abnormal.|| (World Health
     Organization (2001) World Health Report)

   To then have highly sensitive information collected under extremely
   subjective criteria be in a child's lifelong academic record affecting
   grade advancement, special education referrals, college entrance and
   future employment is completely unacceptable.

   3) Horrific Data Security in the US Department of Education The US
   House Oversight and Government Accountability Committee chaired by Rep.
   Jason Chaffetz has held two hearings dealing with the deplorable state
   of student data security in the US Department of Education.  Here are
   some of their findings (emphasis added):
     * The Committee learned at the [57]November 17, 2015 hearing that the
       US Department of Education:
          + Holds 139 million unique Social Security numbers;
          + Continues to be "vulnerable to security threats" according to
            the IG, and has repeat findings in annually-required FISMA
            audits;
          + Failed to detect a penetration test of its systems conducted
            by the IG during its FY2015 [58]FISMA audits [Federal
            Information Modernization Security Act];
          + Received an "F" on the Committee's FITARA
            scorecard[59] [Federal Information Technology Acquisition
            Reform Act].
     * The Committee learned at the [60]February 2, 2016 hearing:
          + The Department of Education's (ED) Chief Information Officer
            (CIO) Danny Harris received substantial bonuses despite poor
            performance in securing IT systems at the Agency and
            significant ethical lapses in judgment.
          + Despite the IG's evidence to the contrary, Acting Secretary
            King asserted that Mr. Harris did not violate any law,
            regulation, policy, or standard of ethical conduct.
          + Mr. Harris testified his home theatre installation and car
            detailing activities were "hobbies" and not businesses. The IG
            testified that these activities qualified as businesses.
          + It was in excess of two years before ED responded to the IG's
            initial report of findings and referral for administrative
            action.
          + The Department of Justice (DOJ) declined to prosecute the IG's
            criminal referral and deferred to ED leadership for action.
            Acting Sec. King deemed verbal counseling and a three-page
            ethics guidance letter as appropriate consequences.

   Does anyone really want psychosocial research and assessment results
   housed in the US Department of Education under these circumstances?

   4) Dangerously weak and gutted Family Educational Rights and Privacy
   Act (FERPA) After the Obama administration's regulatory hatchet job on
   the already weak data protection efforts of FERPA, there was an entire
   section of FERPA regulations that allow sharing of student data without
   parental consent. (See the [61]Formal Response to the Chief State
   School Officers' Letter on Student Data Privacy for details). To then
   have sensitive and subjective socioemotional data gained by research or
   assessments such as is the plan with Common Core assessments PARCC and
   SBAC is extremely concerning:

     "Comply with and where applicable coordinate with the ED staff to
     fulfill the program requirements established in the RTTA Notice
     Inviting Applications and the conditions on the grant award, as well
     as to this agreement, including, but not limited to working with the
     Department to develop a strategy to make student - level
     [individual] data that results from the assessment system available
     on an ongoing basis for research, including for prospective linking,
     validity, and program improvement studies; subject to applicable
     privacy laws" (Emphasis added)

   5) Consent Issues - If curriculum and assessments are used to gather
   this data, will the consent requirements for this socioemotional
   research be circumvented by that loophole in Protection of Pupil Rights
   Amendment (PPRA)? PPRA, cited in section 82 as [62]20 USC 1232h,
   prohibits the collection of psychological, political, religious, and
   other sensitive data in surveys, however, the law says that these
   prohibitions do not apply to "curriculum and instructional materials"
   or to "tests and assessments," such as those required to be aligned to
   Common Core in most states.

   Here are a few statements from the US Department of Education and other
   major national education groups showing that a major purpose for Common
   Core curriculum and assessments, which are still required in a vast
   majority of the United States, is clearly psychosocial:
     * "In national policy, there is increasing attention on 21st-century
       competencies (which encompass arange of noncognitive factors,
       including grit), and persistence is now part of the Common Core
       State Standards for Mathematics." ([63]US Office of Educational
       Technology -emphasis added.)
     * "[64]ASCA [American School Counselors Association] Mindsets &
       Behaviors align with specific standards from the Common Core State
       Standards through connections at the competency level. (Emphasis
       added)"
     * "[A]s new assessment systems are developed to reflect the new
       standards in English language arts, mathematics, and science,
       significant attention will need to be given to the design of tasks
       and situations that call on students to apply a range of 21st
       century competencies that are relevant to each discipline. A
       sustained program of research and development will be required to
       create assessments that are capable of measuring cognitive,
       intrapersonal, and interpersonal skills." ([65]US Office of
       Educational Technology-emphasis added.)
     * "There are important opportunities to leverage new and emerging
       advances in technology (e.g.,educational data mining, affective
       computing, online resources, tools for teachers) to develop
       unprecedented approaches for a wide range of students." ([66]US
       Office of Educational Technology -emphasis added.)

   This type of research should not be done at all, especially under these
   potentially very questionable consent scenarios.

   For these and many other reasons, please continue to contact your US
   House member at 202-224-3121 to let them know of the dangers of this
   bill. Please let them know that not objecting to an unrecorded voice
   vote or voting yes in a recorded vote will be considered allowing
   federally sanctioned psychological profiling and invasion of your
   children.

Campbell's Law

   "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social
   decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures
   and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes
   it is intended to monitor."
