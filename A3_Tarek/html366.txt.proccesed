   A Wisconsin man was charged with first-degree intentional homicide on
   Friday after he allegedly killed one of his former coworkers in the
   parking lot of the market where they both worked.

   Christopher O'Kroley, 26, is accused of shooting dead 24-year-old
   Caroline Nosal at Metro Market Cottage Grove in Madison on Tuesday, a
   day after he was fired from his job.

   Coworkers described the relationship between O'Kroley and Nosal, of
   Stoughton, as one that soured after O'Kroley 'wanted more'.

   O'Kroley's bond was set at $1million on Friday after he was pushed into
   the courtroom in a wheelchair while wearing a suicide-prevention smock,
   according to [67]WKOW. An anti-suicide smock is a tear-resistant
   noose-proof form of clothing that officials put detainees in if they
   are on suicide watch.

   He was also charged with first-degree reckless endangerment.

   Two weeks before the shooting, O'Kroley was suspended from work after
   Nosal told a store manager that she was being harassed by him.

   O'Kroley told police that following his suspension, he began planning
   to kill Nosal and himself if he was fired, according to the
   [68]Wisconsin State Journal.

   He also told police when he was arrested on Wednesday that he would
   have shot Nosal to death a day earlier but he wanted to practice
   shooting the gun he had bought Monday before using it.

   He went to their workplace Monday evening after practicing, but Nosal
   had left work. So O'Kroley went home, watched movies and ordered pizza
   before returning the next day to attempt the shooting again, police
   said.

   He returned to the market on Tuesday and shot Nodal in the head and
   abdomen as she walked through the parking lot as she left work, a
   criminal complaint said.

   O'Kroley had learned through former co-workers via text message - on
   the pretext of collecting his belongings from the store when Nosal was
   not there - that Nosal finished work at 8pm on Tuesday.
   O'Kroley told police officers that it was 'easy' to kill Nosal because
   she had 'ruined my life'

   O'Kroley said he planned to kill Nosal and himself if he was fired from
   Metro Market after his suspension
   But after the shooting of Nosal, he realized that he couldn't kill
   himself, he told police

   O'Kroley said he planned to kill Nosal and himself if he was fired from
   Metro Market after his suspension. But after the shooting, he realized
   that he couldn't kill himself, he told police. Nosal is pictured above
   on Facebook

   He told police that he knelt down beside her car, and when he saw Nosal
   turn the corner, he stood up and shot at her chest.

   When she fell, he shot her once more in the head, he told police.

   He said that it was 'easy' to kill Nosal because she had 'ruined my
   life', and that he killed her out of anger. He described himself to
   police as a 'sociopath'.

   'I killed Caroline and I'm about to kill myself. So don't be surprised
   when I don't respond anymore,' O'Kroley wrote in a text message to a
   coworker after the shooting.

   But he realized that he couldn't kill himself, he told police, and that
   his plan was to 'hijack someone's car at gunpoint', but he instead fled
   the scene in his own car.

   O'Kroley was arrested on Wednesday about four miles from an area where
   his car was found abandoned. Police used K9s and a drone to search for
   him, according to [76]Channel 3000.

   He exchanged gunfire with Madison Police Officer Michele Walker before
   he was arrested, which led to a first-degree reckless endangerment
   charge on Friday.

   'I'm glad I didn't hit her,' he said in court of firing at the officer
   twice. 'I don't know what else, I guess I'm sorry but... I don't know
   if I am sorry, I'm just glad I didn't hit her.'

   Madison police spokesman Joel DeSpain said the department believes that
   O'Kroley 'purchased the firearm locally and legally at a store, however
   that part of the investigation is still ongoing'.

   Wisconsin Legislature eliminated a 48-hour waiting period for
   purchasing a handgun last year.

   A former girlfriend of O'Kroley told the Wisconsin State Journal that
   he had been mentally ill for the past decade and tried to commit
   suicide in 2014.

       pregnant Longmont woman who was stabbed and had her baby cut from
       her womb last year, took the stand Wednesday morning in the trial
       of the woman accused of the attack. Dynel Lane is on trial for
       attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy for the
       March 2015 attack on the then-27-year-old Wilkins. Lane has pleaded

       apartment in Longmont to buy baby clothing when she was attacked.
       Lane is accused of then taking the baby to the hospital and telling
       doctors the baby was hers. Lane is accused of striking Wilkins with
       a lava lamp, then using two knives to stab and choke Wilkins,
       cutting the baby from her womb. Lane then allegedly left Wilkins

       McCartney turned away at a Grammy after-party ... not once, BUT
       TWICE. Paul, Beck, and Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins went to
       Argyle in Hollywood Monday night to hobnob at the bash hosted by
       Tyga. Security was not impressed and told them they were not
       welcome. You hear Paul say, "How VIP do we gotta get? We need
       another hit." After a second failed attempt, the trio bails and
       they make their way to Hyde for the Republic Records party. They
       had better luck there.\nBYLINE MUST READ : AKM-GSI-XPOSURE\n***UK
