3 family members arrested after pulling guns during fight at BREC park

   BATON ROUGE - Three family members are behind bars on attempted murder
   and other charges Thursday after a fight with their daughter and her
   boyfriend at a BREC park ended in shots being fired.

   The victim's parents, 48-year-old Thaddeus Vallery Sr. and 43-year-old
   Tiffany Vallery, and her brother, 20-year-old Thaddeus Vallery Jr.,
   pulled into BREC's Highland Road Community Park in the 14000 block of
   Highland Road at around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday in separate vehicles to
   confront the couple's daughter and her boyfriend. Sheriff's deputies
   said the mother, father and brother used their vehicles to block the
   younger couple in.

   After they'd gotten out of their cars, the family members surrounded
   the woman's vehicle, each armed with a handgun. Deputies said they then
   began to use their guns to beat on the woman's car, threatening to kill
   them if they didn't get out of the vehicle.

   The victims were able to speed away from the scene eventually with the
   family opening fire on them as they fled. They hid at an area store
   after they called 911 to report the shooting.

   Deputies responded to the scene and examined the victim's vehicle,
   noting broken windows and other damage that matched the victims' claims
   that the family members had attacked the vehicle with their weapons. A
   bullet hole in a flat rear tire was discovered by a deputy.

   Deputies said they also found further evidence at the scene of the
   incident at the BREC park that was consistent with what the victims
   told investigators.

   The three family members were booked into EBR Parish Prison early
   Wednesday evening. The Vallerys were booked on two counts of attempted
   first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated assault with a firearm,
   one count of criminal damage to property and one count of simple
   criminal damage to property.
