   Martin Keown has hailed [170]West Ham United ace [171]Martin Samuelsen.

   [174]Pundit Martin Keown has told the Daily Mail that [175]West Ham
   teenager Martin Samuelsen reminds him of former Arsenal star
   [176]Aliaksandr Hleb.

   Samuelsen, 18, left the Manchester City academy last summer in order to
   sign for West Ham United, and after a host of impressive pre-season
   displays, fans were excited to see the Norwegian in [177]Premier League
   action.

   However, [178]the Hammers chose to send the playmaker out on loan to
   League One side Peterborough United, where he has been impressing so
   far.

   The wonderkid played against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup on
   Wednesday night, and ran rings around the Baggies defence with some
   exceptional skill and superb technique.

   The plaudits have been pouring in for Samuelsen, who looks to have a
   huge future ahead of him - and pundit Martin Keown has had his say on
   the youngster.

   [179]Speaking to the Daily Mail, Keown admitted that he though
   Samuelsen was the best player on the pitch against West Brom, and felt
   his confidence was incredible.

   Keown also compared Samuelsen to former Arsenal star Aliaksandr Hleb,
   who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2009 - and West Ham will
   no doubt be hoping that he has similar success to the Belarusian during
   his time with the club.

   "I did the commentary for the game and he was fantastic," said Keown.
   "For someone so young to play with that sort of confidence on that
   stage, it was incredible to see. Technically he looked like the best
   player on the pitch and that's against a Premier League side - although
   he did come through Manchester City's academy before they let him go to
   West Ham last summer, before his loan move to Peterborough."

   "He's confident on the ball, travels with it really and could transfer
   from left to right foot with ease. He ran with real quality. He
   reminded me a bit of Alex Hleb at Arsenal. Sometimes he looked like he
   was about to lose possession because often he shows the ball to his
   opponent but he quickly transfers it and whips it away. I was very
   impressed," he added.

   Do you think Samuelsen will be a star of the future at West Ham?
