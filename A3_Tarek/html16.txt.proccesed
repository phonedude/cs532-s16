   The Associated Press

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A female Sumatran tiger was killed at the
   Sacramento Zoo by her mating partner Wednesday after the two felines
   were put in the same enclosure for breeding, zoo officials said.

   The male tiger became aggressive with the 15-year-old Baha minutes
   after a physical introduction, the zoo said in a statement.

   Staff monitoring the introduction from outside the enclosure used a
   water hose and fire extinguishers to separate the animals. Once the
   male tiger was secured, veterinarians rushed to help Baha, but she had
   already died, officials said.

   They say that since arriving at the zoo from Tennessee in December, the
   12-year-old Mohan had had visual contact with Baha.

   Staff decided to introduce the felines because the tigers' behavior
   indicated it was the proper time, the zoo said.

   Baha had been at the Sacramento Zoo since 2002 and had successfully
   bred with three other partners, giving birth to five offspring.

   Mohan, who is on loan from a zoo in Memphis as part of a tiger breeding
   program, had also successfully bred before with other partners, the zoo
   said.

   "We are truly devastated at the passing of Baha," said Matt McKim, the
   zoo's animal collection director. "Not only was she a wonderful
   ambassador and a truly attentive mother, she was a one-of-a-kind tiger
   that inspired many."
