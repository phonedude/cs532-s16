   Time is quickly winding down for Saturday's Serie A showcase at
   Juventus Stadium. All of two days remain before the clear-cut top two
   teams in Italy square off against one another in a game people have
   been hyping up and anticipating for days on end now. We all know the
   circumstances and what's at stake. If anything, we've been thinking
   about that stuff for even longer than those in the Italian press.

   Both teams will walk into Juventus Stadium on the back of lengthy
   winning streaks. One team has a longer one, but we won't rub that in
   the face of the current league leaders right now. (Although, 14
   straight wins is pretty damn  good.) Both teams will are playing some
   damn good football these days, and they're both pulling away from the
   rest of the pack in the top third of the table because of it.

   But what has allowed Napoli to not only get off to such a strong start
   this season, but also maintain it? That's what we're here to try and
   find out about. We've enlisted the help of Conor, the resident Napoli
   expert here at SB Nation who just so happens to write about Juve's
   opposition on Saturday night on a pretty regular basis over at [70]The
   Siren's Song.

   So, without further adieu, we had some questions for the exalted ruler
   of both the network's Napoli blog and all of SBN Italia as a whole, and
   he had some answers for us all.

   BWRAO: Let's get right to the point. Is Gonzalo Higuaín human? Or, in
   an easier way of phrasing it, just how dominant of a striker he's been
   this season?

   TSS: I think he's been replaced with a T-1000. It's the only real way
   to explain it.

   Seriously, though, there's a couple of reasons. He got healthier over
   the summer, changing his diet so he could have more energy and drop
   some weight. Between that and the tactical adjustments made by Maurizio
   Sarri, both in terms of team shape and approach, and Higuain has been a
   huge beneficiary of that.

   More than anything else, though, he's been more consistent this season.
   In previous years, Higuain has tended to go on white-hot runs of form,
   then spend upwards of two months not doing much at all. This season,
   he's been consistently involved and consistently effective, and it's
   been a joy to behold.

   BWRAO: Since Juventus and Napoli last saw one another, neither team has
   had many slip ups. From the Napoli point of view, what has enabled them
   to pick up point so consistently?

   TSS: They play as a unit, not just with each other but for each other.
   They spent the last two seasons playing in a bunch of individual roles
   in a system that demanded many of Napoli's players to do things they
   weren't comfortable with or were well-suited for, and teamwork was
   almost a secondary concern. This season, Sarri has set them up in a way
   that plays to their strengths and imbued a sense of togetherness that
   Napoli had sorely lacked. These players play for each other, fight for
   each other, and win for each other. That is why they've been so
   consistent, because when one man falters, another steps up to cover him
   and lift him back up.

   BWRAO: What's an area of Napoli's squad that might not be getting as
   much recognition as it deserves due to Higuaín's insane season?

   TSS: Just how f**king good their midfield has been. The trio of Marek
   Hamsik, Jorginho, and Allan have controlled almost every match the trio
   has played together, keeping possession with ease and flying all over
   the pitch to break up the opponents' play and help spring Napoli's
   fierce, quick-developing attacks.Their balance and ability to work
   fluidly together is top-notch, and they can adjust to almost any
   threat. Watching them do their thing this season has been all kinds of
   fun, and hopefully they're just going to keep getting better and
   better.

   BWRAO: Lorenzo Insigne is already in double digits when it comes to
   goals and assists. Is this the player Napoli fans thought he would be
   when he first burst onto the scene a few years ago?

   TSS: I think he's more than that player. Back then, fans saw a
   miniature Ezequiel Lavezzi, who at the time was a very good player but
   not nearly as complete and well-rounded as Insigne is today. His
   ability to disrupt defenses and score goals has never really been in
   doubt -- a couple rough runs of form aside -- but his playmaking skill
   has taken massive strides over the last couple of years, with
   improvements coming by leaps and bounds this season. He's becoming a
   special player right in front of our eyes, and this payoff of the years
   of love and trust the fans have given Insigne is simply wonderful.

   BWRAO: Does this game being played at Juventus Stadium and not the San
   Paolo worry you much?

   TSS: Nah. Has to be played somewhere, and Napoli already whooped
   Juventus at the San Paolo, so that means it has to be played outside of
   Naples for the sake of fairness.
