Corn on the Cob Day

   [45]Corn on the Cob Day

   Each day of the year is often times a food holiday that is unique and
   fun to celebrate. So I've done the research to bring you a fun food
   holiday each day!!

   Corn on the Cob Day is celebrated each year on June 11th!!  While this
   is a delicious treat, here in Missouri it isn't quite ready to go just
   yet.  But there is always the frozen or store bought kind to help us
   out in a pinch!! But my favorite corn on the cob comes out of a garden
   locally grown!! We have about another month to wait for this delicious
   food to set on.  So in the meantime I guess I will dream about the
   first ear of corn!!

   Enjoy yours with butter, salt and of course a little pepper!!

   Happy Corn on the Cob Day!
