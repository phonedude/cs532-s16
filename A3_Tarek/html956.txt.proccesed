   Social networks   Swedish authorities will consider an age limit

Sweden proposes age limit for social media use

   [18]Tweet

   Thursday February 11, 2016 4:35AM ET

   Per Bolund The Swedish government proposed an age limit for teenagers
   who want to interact on social media as a result of data protection
   rules at the European Union (EU) level.

   Swedish authorities will consider an age limit between 13 and 16 as a
   result of a data protection directive finalized by the EU in December,
   according to Consumer Minister Per Bolund.
   "It is a binding directive, so somewhere in that range is where the
   Swedish rules will end up," Bolund told public broadcaster Swedish
   Television.
   Children who have not yet reached the age limit will need their
   guardian's consent to use social media applications or websites,
   Swedish Television reported.
   "I might question whether these rules are necessary at all, but we are
   not at liberty to choose since this is an EU directive due for
   implementation at the national level," Bolund told daily newspaper
   Dagens Nyheter.
   Sweden's Data Inspectorate agency said the EU law would be drafted and
   turned into Swedish law by April or May of this year. fS
