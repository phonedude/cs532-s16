Einstein's gravitational waves 'seen' from black holes

   By Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent, BBC News
     * 11 February 2016
     * From the section [58]Science & Environment

   Scientists are claiming a stunning discovery in their quest to fully
   understand gravity.

   They have observed the warping of space-time generated by the collision
   of two black holes more than a billion light-years from Earth.

   The international team says the first detection of these gravitational
   waves will usher in a new era for astronomy.

   It is the culmination of decades of searching and could ultimately
   offer a window on the Big Bang.

   The research, by the [59]Ligo Collaboration, has been published today
   in the journal [60]Physical Review Letters.

   The collaboration operates a number of labs around the world that fire
   lasers through long tunnels, trying to sense ripples in the fabric of
   space-time.

   [62]'Astonishing' waves: The numbers don't do them justice

   [63]Prof Norna Robertson: "We've finally done it"

   [64]WATCH: Five ways gravitational waves matter

   The signals they detect are incredibly subtle and disturb the machines,
   known as interferometers, by just fractions of the width of an atom.

   But this black hole merger was picked up almost simultaneously by two
   widely separated Ligo facilities in the US.

   The merger radiated three times the mass of the sun in pure
   gravitational energy.

   "We have detected gravitational waves," Prof David Reitze, executive
   director of the Ligo project, told journalists at a news conference in
   Washington DC.

   "It's the first time the Universe has spoken to us through
   gravitational waves. Up until now, we've been deaf."

   Prof Karsten Danzmann, from the [65]Max Planck Institute for
   Gravitational Physics and Leibniz University in Hannover, Germany, is a
   European leader on the collaboration.

   He said the detection was one of the most important developments in
   science since the discovery of the Higgs particle, and on a par with
   the determination of the structure of DNA.

   "There is a Nobel Prize in it - there is no doubt," he told the BBC.

   "It is the first ever direct detection of gravitational waves; it's the
   first ever direct detection of black holes and it is a confirmation of
   General Relativity because the property of these black holes agrees
   exactly with what Einstein predicted almost exactly 100 years ago."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ripples in the fabric of space-time
     * Gravitational waves are prediction of the Theory of General
       Relativity
     * Their existence has been inferred by science but only now directly
       detected
     * They are ripples in the fabric of space and time produced by
       violent events
     * Accelerating masses will produce waves that propagate at the speed
       of light
     * Detectable sources ought to include merging black holes and neutron
       stars
     * Ligo fires lasers into long, L-shaped tunnels; the waves disturb
       the light
     * Detecting the waves opens up the Universe to completely new
       investigations
     __________________________________________________________________

   That view was reinforced by Prof Stephen Hawking, who is an expert on
   black holes. Speaking exclusively to BBC News, he said he believed that
   the detection marked a key moment in scientific history.

   "Gravitational waves provide a completely new way at looking at the
   Universe. The ability to detect them has the potential to revolutionise
   astronomy. This discovery is the first detection of a black hole binary
   system and the first observation of black holes merging," he said.
   Media captionFive reasons why gravitational waves matter

   "Apart from testing (Albert Einstein's theory of) General Relativity,
   we could hope to see black holes through the history of the Universe.
   We may even see relics of the very early Universe during the Big Bang
   at some of the most extreme energies possible."

   Team member Prof Gabriela González, from Louisiana State University,
   said: "We have discovered gravitational waves from the merger of black
   holes. It's been a very long road, but this is just the beginning.

   "Now that we have the detectors to see these systems, now that we know
   binary black holes are out there - we'll begin listening to the
   Universe. "

   The Ligo laser interferometers in [66]Hanford, in Washington, and
   [67]Livingston, in Louisiana, were only recently refurbished and had
   [68]just come back online when they sensed the signal from the
   collision. This occurred at 10.51 GMT on 14 September last year.

   On a graph, the data looks like a symmetrical, wiggly line that
   gradually increases in height and then suddenly fades away.

   "We found a beautiful signature of the merger of two black holes and it
   agrees exactly - fantastically - with the numerical solutions to
   Einstein equations... it looked too beautiful to be true," said Prof
   Danzmann.
   Media captionProf Stephen Hawking: "This provides a completely new way
   of looking at the universe."

   Prof Sheila Rowan, who is one of the lead UK researchers involved in
   the project, said that the first detection of gravitational waves was
   just the start of a "terrifically exciting" journey.

   "The fact that we are sitting here on Earth feeling the actual fabric
   of the Universe stretch and compress slightly due to the merger of
   black holes that occurred just over a billion years ago - I think
   that's phenomenal. It's amazing that when we first turned on our
   detectors, the Universe was ready and waiting to say 'hello'," the
   Glasgow University scientist told the BBC.

   Being able to detect gravitational waves enables astronomers finally to
   probe what they call "dark" Universe - the majority part of the cosmos
   that is invisible to the light telescopes in use today.

Perfect probe

   Not only will they be able to investigate black holes and strange
   objects known as neutron stars (giant suns that have collapsed to the
   size of cities), they should also be able to "look" much deeper into
   the Universe - and thus farther back in time. It may even be possible
   eventually to sense the moment of the Big Bang.

   "Gravitational waves go through everything. They are hardly affected by
   what they pass through, and that means that they are perfect
   messengers," said Prof Bernard Schutz, from Cardiff University, UK.

   "The information carried on the gravitational wave is exactly the same
   as when the system sent it out; and that is unusual in astronomy. We
   can't see light from whole regions of our own galaxy because of the
   dust that is in the way, and we can't see the early part of the Big
   Bang because the Universe was opaque to light earlier than a certain
   time.
   Media captionScience correspondent explains gravitational waves and
   what their discovery means for science

   "With gravitational waves, we do expect eventually to see the Big Bang
   itself," he told the BBC.

   In addition, the study of gravitational waves may ultimately help
   scientists in their quest to solve some of the biggest problems in
   physics, such as the unification of forces, linking quantum theory with
   gravity.

   At the moment, General Relativity describes the cosmos on the largest
   scales tremendously well, but it is to quantum ideas that we resort
   when talking about the smallest interactions. Being able to study
   places in the Universe where gravity is really extreme, such as at
   black holes, may open a path to new, more complete thinking on these
   issues.
     __________________________________________________________________

     * A laser is fed into the machine and its beam is split along two
       paths
     * The separate paths bounce back and forth between damped mirrors
     * Eventually, the two light parts are recombined and sent to a
       detector
     * Gravitational waves passing through the lab should disturb the
       set-up
     * Theory holds they should very subtly stretch and squeeze its space
     * This ought to show itself as a change in the lengths of the light
       arms (green)
     * The photodetector captures this signal in the recombined beam
     __________________________________________________________________

   Scientists have sought experimental evidence for gravitational waves
   for more than 40 years.

   Einstein himself actually thought a detection might be beyond the reach
   of technology.

   His theory of General Relativity suggests that objects such as stars
   and planets can warp space around them - in the same way that a
   billiard ball creates a dip when placed on a thin, stretched, rubber
   sheet.

   Gravity is a consequence of that distortion - objects will be attracted
   to the warped space in the same way that a pea will fall in to the dip
   created by the billiard ball.

Inspirational moment

   Einstein predicted that if the gravity in an area was changed suddenly
   - by an exploding star, say - waves of gravitational energy would
   ripple across the Universe at light-speed, stretching and squeezing
   space as they travelled.

   Although a fantastically small effect, modern technology has now risen
   to the challenge.

   Much of the R&D work for the Washington and Louisiana machines was done
   at Europe's smaller GEO600 interferometer in Hannover.

   "I think it's phenomenal to be able to build an instrument capable of
   measuring [gravitational waves]," said Prof Rowan.

   "It is hugely exciting for a whole generation of young people coming
   along, because these kinds of observations and this real pushing back
   of the frontiers is really what inspires a lot of young people to get
   into science and engineering."
