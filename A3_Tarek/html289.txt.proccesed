This is how America rations health care

   Hepatitis C is a debilitating illness that wreaks havoc on the liver,
   making it unable to filter blood and letting toxins spread throughout
   the body. It kills about 15,000 people annually.

   In 1990, David Morton found out he had it. Recently, he got some good
   news: There had been an incredible medical breakthrough for people like
   him. His doctor prescribed a new drug called Harvoni, which has a 90
   percent chance of curing this previously incurable disease.

   Then last fall, Morton received an astonishing letter from his
   insurance company. In order to get the drug, his insurer explained,
   he'd have to wait for his disease to get worse. The hepatitis hadn't
   yet done enough damage to Morton's liver to merit Harvoni.

   "Essentially they're saying I have to get closer to becoming a liver
   cancer victim before I can have treatment," says Morton, 62, who lives
   in the Seattle area.

   The drug is part of a wave of expensive and effective hepatitis C
   treatments that came onto the market in 2015. But these drugs come with
   a catch. One course of Harvoni costs $94,500. Each pill has a price tag
   above $1,000.
   ""Essentially they're saying I have to get closer to becoming a liver
   cancer victim before I can have treatment""

   Harvoni (and its predecessor, a similar drug called Sovaldi) is among
   the most expensive drugs to hit the American market in recent memory.
   It's not that these drugs contain some excessively expensive
   ingredient. Rather, drugmakers have found that hepatitis C patients are
   desperate enough for a cure to allow these types of prices.

   Insurers did the math. They knew that there are 3.2 million people in
   the United States living with hepatitis C -- and the costs of buying
   Harvoni for all of them would cause premiums to skyrocket. Some began
   to ration access. Morton's insurer, Group Health, decided to limit
   coverage to hepatitis C patients with more advanced liver disease.

   Another Seattle-area insurer, Regence BlueShield, [31]says that "given
   the high cost of oral medications ... coverage is limited to patient
   population at the highest risk of severe complications."

   Patients are starting to fight back. Morton is part of a class-action
   lawsuit that argues these insurers must make good on their contractual
   promise to pay for "medically necessary" services. The complaint is
   unique -- and the eventual ruling could have national consequences as
   more expensive new drugs come onto the market.

   "I think we're in new ground with this," says Kevin Costello, senior
   associate director of Harvard's Center for Health Law and Policy
   Innovation. "It's an emerging issue, as we're seeing this explosion of
   high drug prices."

   The Morton case is a window into how America's especially high health
   care prices lead to rationing. The fact that we pay thousands of
   dollars more for Harvoni and countless other drugs means we can't
   afford to buy as many prescriptions. It means that our system, even if
   we don't like to admit it, has to pick and choose who gets access to
   lifesaving drugs -- and in this case, Morton was not one of the lucky
   ones.

The big question: What counts as medically necessary?

   Harvoni Harvoni

   Harvoni costs more than $1,000 per pill -- or $94,500 for a full course
   of treatment. (Baltimore Sun)

   Somewhere in the fine print of nearly any insurance contract is a
   promise to cover all "medically necessary" services for whoever decides
   to buy a policy.

   The Morton suit argues that hepatitis C treatment is of course
   necessary for a hepatitis C patient. Left untreated, the virus has an
   85 percent chance of causing a chronic liver infection. Somewhere
   between [32]1 and 5 percent of hepatitis C patients die from the
   disease's complications.

   There is plentiful evidence that Harvoni can cure hepatitis C for
   early-stage patients. The American Association for the Study of Liver
   Disease [33]recommends that all hepatitis C patients have access to
   medications like Harvoni, except for those whose disease is so far
   progressed they have little chance of survival.

   "Defining "medical necessity" isn't always easy"

   But defining "medical necessity" isn't always easy. There's no one list
   of treatments that do or don't count. Insurers set their own
   definitions, and they're usually vague. Medicare, for example, defines
   medical necessity as "reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or
   treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a
   malformed body member." A gym membership, for instance, would likely
   "improve" the body's functioning -- a trip to a nice spa might do the
   trick, for that matter -- but insurers don't feel compelled to provide
   such benefits.

   And there are more serious edge cases, like chemotherapy treatments
   that work in a small handful of patients. If there's a chance they
   might work, but the chance is small, should those get included?

   Group Health, Morton's insurer, defended the policy as evidence-based.

   "We reference widely adopted guidelines from national professional
   organizations to inform the clinical treatment options available to our
   members," spokesperson Jackson Holtz said in a statement. "And we are
   continuously re-evaluating recommendations from a number of research,
   policy, regulatory and advocacy bodies to help our members achieve
   better health outcomes."

   ""Insurers are saying, 'We'll treat you once your disease has become
   more severe'""

   The idea here is that Group Health isn't denying treatment and would
   certainly intervene before Morton's disease progressed toward liver
   failure or cancer. Fifteen percent of hepatitis C infections clear up
   without any treatment; it's possible his could be one of them.

   "Insurers are saying, 'We'll treat you once your disease has become
   more severe,'" says Harvard's Costello. "This is medically equivalent
   to saying, 'We'll stand back and observe and be careful about not
   letting anything get out of control.'"

   Morton's hepatitis C is still in early stages. On the 4-point scale
   used to measure the severity of the disease, with 4 being cirrhosis, he
   ranks between 0 and 1. Still, he gets pain around his liver and fatigue
   that he attributes to the disease.

   "What I'm looking forward to, and what I've heard from others who have
   been cured, is really getting my energy back," he says. "I would like
   to feel fatigue-free. It's a disabling condition. I would like to live
   my life and be a contributing member of society."

Poor patients are fighting the exact same battle

   When Harvoni, Sovaldi, and other expensive hepatitis C drugs came onto
   the market in 2015, the public insurance program Medicaid created
   similar restrictions to those that insurers like Group Health and
   Bridgespan have now.

   One study this summer found that 33 state Medicaid programs restricted
   access to the sickest patients, those who had scores of 3 or 4 on the
   4-point fibrosis scale. Additionally, 35 states required patients to
   abstain from drinking in order to gain access to the drug.

   A separate study found that at least half of Medicaid patients
   prescribed these drugs were denied coverage because the treatment
   wasn't "medically necessary."

   "The combination of the high cost of treatment and insufficient
   Medicaid budgets precludes programs from providing widespread access to
   treatment," Lauren Canary, Monina Klevens, and Scott Holmberg wrote in
   a review article about state policies.

   A memo from the Obama administration this past November urged Medicaid
   programs to revisit these policies to ensure that no patients were
   inappropriately denied medically necessary care. But it stopped short
   of outlawing such practices.

   "Some Medicaid programs have thought about ending dental coverage to
   pay for Harvoni"

   There's no easy answer for Medicaid programs. They are required, by
   law, to provide beneficiaries with medically necessary benefits.
   Medicaid is already the biggest budget item in most states' budgets,
   and getting legislators to provide even more funding can be an
   impossible battle.

   "What dictates coverage is the money coming out of the state's general
   revenue," says Matt Salo, director of the National Association of
   Medicaid Directors. "If you can't get blood out of that stone, then
   you're a bit stuck."

   Salo says that states end up in tough positions. Missouri, for example,
   considered eliminating all dental coverage for adults in order to pay
   for the pricey new hepatitis C drugs.

   "That's not something anyone wants," he says. "But the trade-offs end
   up being very real."

The real problem is American drug prices. But nobody talks about that.

   The reason this battle plays out in the United States -- and not in
   Canada, or European countries, or really anywhere else -- is that the
   United States doesn't regulate drug prices.

   Other countries have negotiated with the drugmakers to get better
   deals. The United Kingdom, for example, pays $55,000 for the hepatitis
   C drug Sovaldi; the United States pays $84,000. For all the
   scaremongering about British health care, the country doesn't ration
   this drug like we do. Instead, it recommends Sovaldi for all hepatitis
   C patients -- something it can do in part because it pays less for it.

   Federal law specifically bars Medicare from negotiating drug prices in
   the way Britain does. Individual health plans can negotiate on their
   own behalf, but there are thousands of them scattered across the
   country, so they have little leverage in asking for a discount. The
   result is the United States ends up with the highest drug prices in the
   world, even though we're taking the exact same pills. Sometimes those
   prices lead to real rationing -- as in the case of Morton.

   "The United States pays more than other countries for drugs"

   Drugmakers argue that the higher American prices allow them to do more
   research and offer better drugs. There is at least some research that
   shows this is true. But one undeniable consequence is that we end up
   with these types of legal battles about who gets treatment -- and who
   pays. When the bill is so big, it's impossible not to.
