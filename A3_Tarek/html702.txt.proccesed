   Calgary Region restaurants - food shots Calgary Region restaurants -
   food shots

   By Chad Hason, Content Contributor

   I travel a lot, and often relied on the kindness of people who appear
   both local and well-fed to steer me to the best places to eat.

   It's not enough to be delicious - I also appreciate a good deal.

   Why should my home town and surrounding region be any different?

   Without further adieu - here are my top five recommendations for anyone
   who wants to eat deliciously inexpensive local treats!


1. [28]La Vida Loca

   Calgary Region restaurants - mexican Calgary Region restaurants -
   mexican

   Located downtown Calgary on sunny 17th AVE SW, La Vida Loca offers
   authentic Mexican cuisine - we're talking about momma's recipes passed
   down to her son.

   An owner who passes her passion for the art of Mexican food along to
   those who appreciate little touches and big flavour.

   Fresh guacamole is made right in front of you.

   The tortillas are warm, soft and homemade and the masterful
   presentation of each unique plate is the only reason to hold yourself
   back from devouring each item - if only for a brief, spectacular
   moment.

   All for a price that makes it hard to understand whether this is chic
   dining or good ol' street food.

   Mondays and Wednesdays are taco night - where you get the same amazing
   tacos (your choice of fillings) at a discounted price. Perfect for
   first-time tasters.

   Speaking of perfect - I recommend enjoying them with a freshly blended
   margarita on their oversized patio surrounded by palm trees and classic
   lanterns...once the weather warms up, of course.

   Between its patio, price and portions - you'd be hard-pressed to find
   better Mexican cuisine this side of Mexico.

   Top Five Dishes

   Personal Favourite:
   Fish Tacos

   Authentic Dish:
   Chicken Mole Classic Tacos (with guac, of course)

   Veggie Lover:
   Ceviche (take your pick- they are all amazing)

   Sweet Tooth:
   Fresh Churros!


2. [31]Without Papers

   Calgary Region restaurants-pizza Calgary Region restaurants-pizza I try
   to keep an open mind when it comes to some things - but when it comes
   to the best darn thin-crust pizza in Calgary - you'd be hard-pressed to
   beat Without Papers.

   Now to be fair - I love a lot of pizza places in Calgary - and I agree
   that different strokes appeal to different folks.

   But when my friend Jordan originally gave me a bite of the cold Without
   Papers Pizza leftovers he forgot in his car - even that, at the time,
   was the best pizza I've ever had.

   Their authentic, thin-crust style makes the only type of pizza that has
   me looking forward to getting to the crust - in fact, I personally roll
   each slice up so that I get a taste of the crust in every bite.

   They are perfect for takeout on the way out of downtown, and in the
   spring, they deliver their pizza on old-school cruiser bikes - if you
   live close enough.

   But the true experience involves going up the stairs to their sit-down
   restaurant.

   Featuring a mix of comfortable booths and tables, the food is
   complemented by the showing of classic retro movies projected on the
   walls next to their colourful wall-mounted "movie-esque" posters,
   creatively promoting a wide variety of their patented pizza options.

   And if you have problems sticking stuff to your fridge - good news,
   they let you take their fridge magnets home.

   Top Five Dishes

   Personal Favourite:
   The Hutch Pizza

   Authentic Dish:
   Parma Pizza

   Veggie Lover:
   Shroom Pizza

   Sweet Tooth:
   Sweet Julie Dessert Pizza


3. [34]Tuk Tuk Thai

   Calgary Region restaurants - tuk tuk thai Calgary Region restaurants -
   tuk tuk thai

   Fast and flavourful. That's their slogan - and if you know anything
   about the history of this newly opened 17th Ave Thai take-out - you can
   be sure it lives up to its name.

   First of all - if you have lived in Calgary for any length of time, and
   have sought out the best Thai restaurants, I have no doubt you've
   already come across Thai Sa-on Royal Thai Cuisine.

   Located on 10th AVE, this sit-down restaurant has been rated the best
   Thai food restaurant by the likes of John Gilchrist, Where Calgary,
   Fast Forward and even by Jackie Chan.

   Known for delicious, authentic Thai, the ownership group decided to
   take their offering to the busy streets of Calgary.

   They opened a small take-out restaurant that offers some of their most
   popular, authentic, hand crafted, family-recipe Thai dishes - without
   the soothing, sit-down Asian decor and award-winning wine list offered
   at Thai Sa-on.

   But that isn't to say it doesn't have its own unique and attractive
   decor.

   Featuring photos from the owner's home land and a real Tuk Tuk crafted
   into a display case cooler, there are plenty attractions while you wait
   for your food.

   Open late and providing a refreshing change from late-night burgers and
   pizza, Tuk Tuk Thai is the place to go for those who crave a little
   variety and aren't afraid of a little spice!

   Moo Moo Lemon

   Authentic Dish:
   Pad Thai with Chicken

   Veggie Lover:
   Basa Garden

   Sweet Tooth:
   Fried Bananas


4. [37]Evelyn's Memory Lane Cafe

   CRP Restaurants-300 CRP Restaurants-300 It's not always easy to write
   with any measure of certainty that a place can always be expected to
   consistently deliver deliciousness.

   Especially one with a regularly changing menu, with features based on
   seasonal favourites

   However, if you've ever been to High River's Evelyn' Memory Lane Cafe,
   you know this to be the case.

   Just like the model train running around the roof and the mini
   jukeboxes in every booth - this longstanding cafe-style restaurant
   offers the type of fun, selection and comfort-style cooking you used to
   have at Grandma's.

   From shepherd's pie to made to order sandwiches featuring Evelyn's
   freshly made grain bread - it's the type of place you always leave
   feeling good about what you ate.

   And don't worry - just because it's home style cooking, doesn't mean
   you gluten-free, vegans and vegetarians don't get their own tempting
   selections.

   Not to mention the ever-rotating selections of homemade pies and even
   small-batch, handcrafted ice cream?

   What can top that?

   Top Five Dishes

   Personal Favourite:
   Tough to say - is the chili on the menu, if not - Reuben Sandwich.

   Authentic Dish:
   Fresh, handcrafted, small-batch ice cream.

   Veggie Lover:
   Health Nut Sandwich

   Sweet Tooth:
   Strawberry Rhubarb Pie


5. [40]Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus

   Calgary Region restaurants - birthday Calgary Region restaurants -
   birthday

   First thing - don't show up here with a family of eight on Saturday
   morning and expect to be seated within the hour.

   They are usually quite busy - and for a very good reason!

   Yet, no matter how many times I talk about it socially, I keep meeting
   people who still haven't had the pleasure.

   Frankly, it doesn't need my endorsement - and there isn't much I can
   say about it that hasn't already been covered by Global, the Food
   Network, You Gotta Eat Here! and a plethora of other reviews you can
   read on their walls.

   Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus is a family-friendly, locally owned slice
   of authentic Holland cooking known worldwide for their Dutch
   "Pannenkoek" (similar to a crepe) served with toppings and fillings
   that are either savory or sweet.

   It can be a meal or a treat. It's the one place I'm willing to share my
   food with others. Well... willing to trade. It's pretty fun to eat
   there.

   Frankly, Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus, the only restaurant of its kind
   in Canada, is somewhere you need to experience to fully appreciate.
   [41]The only restaurant of its kind in Canada...somewhere you need to

   Top Five Dishes

   Personal Favourite:
   Mushroom Soup (try it before your Pannenkoek)

   Savory Classic:
   Potato, Onion, Bacon & Cheese Pannenkoek (with a side of sour cream)

   Sweet Classic:
   Banaan en chocoladesaus Pannenkoek (Banana and chocolate sauce)

   Have to Try:
   Kaneel roll (Brown sugar, cinnamon, cream cheese icing and baked apple)

   __________

   There you have it - a 25-year insider's review of restaurants you
   absolutely must try.

   Consider yourself deliciously informed!

   How about you? Do you have any favourite hidden local eats that you
   want to share?

       MMM...yummy. Still remember that mushroom soup. SO good. Glad
       Pfanntastic made your list.
       Have you ever made your way out the Saskatoon farm? It's
       delightful.
