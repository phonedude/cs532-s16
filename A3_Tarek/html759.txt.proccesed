Ford is launching an on-demand bus service in Kansas City

   The carmaker is teaming up with Bridj, a pop-up bus service from Boston

   Public transportation in Kansas City is about to get a lot brand-ier.
   Next month, Ford is teaming up with Bridj, a data-driven pop-up bus
   company, and the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) to
   roll out a fleet of shuttle vans that residents can summon with the tap
   of an app. Ten Ford Transit shuttle buses, manufactured in Kansas City
   and sporting both Ford and Bridj's logos, will start picking up and
   dropping off passengers in those KC neighborhoods underserved by
   existing public transportation.

   This is how it will work: Kansas City residents call up the [241]Bridj
   app (available in iOS and Android), input their location and their
   destination, and then choose from a list of available prearranged times
   that one of Ford's shuttles will arrive at a nearby pop-up bus stop. By
   selecting one of the times, the rider is reserving a seat on that
   shuttle, each of which can only carry 14 passengers.

   The one-year pilot program initially will include downtown Kansas City,
   the near east and west sides, Hospital Hill, Crown Center, portions of
   Midtown, University of Kansas Medical Center, and the Historic 18th and
   Vine Jazz district. As more riders use the service and more data is
   collected, more neighborhoods will be added, the organizers say. The
   service will essentially operate as an on-demand private bus service
   with a blessing from the city's public transportation agency.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ""It's not superfluous, it's a core service.""

   "This is not supplementing existing transportation," Matt George,
   founder of the Boston-based Bridj, told The Verge. "We're just
   providing the end-user with another option." The new (and rather
   awkwardly named) Ride KC: Bridj project will utilize drivers who are
   working for KCATA in shuttle buses owned by the city, he said. "It's
   not superfluous, it's a core service," George added.

   Ford, Bridj, and KCATA are pitching this project as the "first U.S.
   public-private collaboration [to] bring together a major US transit
   system, an automaker, and an urban technology company to enhance
   existing mass transit." Robbie Makinen, president and CEO of KCATA,
   called the project "microtransit" insofar as it creates "a seamless and
   borderless transportation network for our residents that is easy to
   use, comfortable, and affordable."

   It will also serve as the first big test for Ford's Smart Mobility
   Initiative, which the carkmaker bills as [242]its marquee effort to
   reduce car traffic, solve transportation challenges, and hopefully sell
   some vehicles in the process. Previously, that initiative has featured
   an [243]on-demand shuttle service at Ford's Dearborn, Michigan, campus,
   and ridesharing pilots in New York, London, India, and Germany. Ride
   KC: Bridj will be the latest plank in that initiative.

   "A sign of the times for public transportation "

   Ford is not the only legacy automaker to dip its toes into ridesharing
   and public transit. Last month, General Motors announced it
   was [244]launching a new car-sharing service called Maven in Ann Arbor,
   Michigan. This spurt of activity is meant to signal that the auto
   industry does not intend to let Uber, Lyft, and all those millennials
   trending away from car ownership and toward ride- and car-sharing
   negatively effect into its bottom line.

   It also could be a sign of the times for public transportation
   agencies, which are [245]facing hundreds of billions of dollars in
   repairs while their taxpayer-funded budgets dry up. If a deep-pocketed
   car company and a fancy, out-of-state tech firm come along and offer to
   help pay for expanded service, what transit agency could possibly say
   no?

   Ride KC: Bridj will just be the latest new transit option for Kansas
   City residents, who are about to get a shiny new streetcar for their
   downtown's main drag. The [246]KC Streetcar is expected to start
   operating this spring, although the new service [247]keeps getting held
   up by cars parking on the tracks.
