   For one of the last times during the recruiting process -- maybe the
   last time -- the phone of Nacogdoches safety Brandon Jones buzzed in
   the early moments of National Signing Day, about eight hours or so
   before Jones was set to announce his decision on ESPNU. [82]Texas
   Longhorns head coach Charlie Strong was on the other end.

   "Where you at?" Strong asked, not trying to pressure, just trying to
   communicate.

   "I don't know, coach. I don't know if I'm going to be able to sleep
   tonight," Jones replied.

   While it's not clear whether Jones actually did sleep that night, at
   some point after Strong called, in those early hours of Wednesday
   morning, the former five-star prospect came to his decision. When it
   came time to announce a few short hours later, Jones lingered before
   delivering the final critical words in his statement, "I decided for
   the next four years, I will be furthering my education and my football
   career to..."

   For the next 10 interminable seconds, live on television across the
   world, he freed a lone hat from a black bag.

   It was burnt orange, with a silver snap strap and sparkling silver
   thread on the logo.

   "...The University of Texas," Jones finished, already drowned out by
   celebratory cheers from those in attendance at his high school, having
   chosen the Longhorns over the Texas A&M Aggies and [83]Baylor Bears,
   his other two finalists.

   Meanwhile, in Austin, the coaches were also going wild in celebration.

   Most of them, at least. One of the best visuals from the Texas coaches
   on National Signing Day was tight ends coach Jeff Traylor sitting deep
   in thought with no outward reaction to the decision by Jones as the
   other staff members celebrated. Perhaps the National Letter of Intent
   was already in hand from Jones. Perhaps Traylor just knew that he had
   put in the necessary work to win out over the Aggies. A pretty penny or
   two for those thoughts, indeed.

   "My decision was made last night and last night was the first time that
   I was able to think of stuff on my own," Jones[90] told AggieYell after
   his announcement. "I was talking to my mom and all three schools are
   really good schools and I've really enjoyed everything they've done for
   me. I really loved all the coaching staffs, so it was just one thing
   that separated them from each other.

   "I just felt more at home, honestly, at UT."

   Traylor himself had played a critical role in Jones feeling that way at
   Texas.

   "He kinda took that place as a father figure and he was always there
   for me," [91]said Jones, who recently lost his own father to cancer.

   As calm as Traylor looked during that exultant moment, the process was
   likely much more difficult for him this year than it was last year,
   when he was *merely* the high school coach receiving calls about where
   his star cornerback [92]Kris Boyd was going to go. The irony wasn't
   lost on Strong.

   "I told Traylor that last year you were on the other side because you
   had Kris Boyd and we kept calling you, 'What's he going to do? Now you
   have Brandon [Jones] and now you try and what's he going to do?'"

   "He kinda took that place as a father figure and he was always there
   for me." -- Jones on Jeff Traylor

   More than just the fact that Texas was able to land the consensus top
   safety in the country, winning the critical recruiting battle against
   Texas A&M, the longtime favorites with Jones, was even more crucial for
   the Longhorns after the Aggies mostly dominated the East Texas region
   in the 2015 cycle, securing signatures from Piney Woods stars like
   defensive tackle [93]Daylon Mack, safety [94]Larry Pryor, and
   safety/outside linebacker [95]Justin Dunning.

   "You look at him coming out of Nacogdoches," Strong said. "It was
   important for us to get out into East Texas, and to go into East Texas
   and get us one. He is going to be a really unbelievable player for us."

   Since "unbelievable" is the go-to superlative for Strong when
   discussing any subject, it's not always the most precise word for him.
   But Jones truly has a chance to be an unbelievable player for the
   Longhorns -- he possesses a rare combination of poise, the mental and
   emotional makeup to succeed, the drive to continuously strive to
   improve, and the physical skills that make such lofty projections
   possible.

   As an athlete, it's instructive to watch Jones playing with the ball in
   his hands in the return game and on offense as a senior after missing
   most of his junior season due to injury. The result? Eight touchdowns
   on offense and special teams, including a 59-yard touchdown run against
   Corsicana.

   If Jones' elite-level agility on defense wasn't enough to declare him a
   superb athlete, it doesn't take much time watching his senior film to
   see it on offense and special teams. He can stop-start, take the edge,
   show some physicality by breaking tackles with leg drive and stiff
   arms, and finish with touchdowns due to a combination of top-end speed
   and pure desire.

   On defense, he returned to his sophomore form, notching 124 tackles,
   including 16 tackles for loss, and two interceptions. Is Jones the deep
   safety to serve as the last line of defense and ballhawk on deep passes
   with his sensational range or the in-box safety capable of blowing up
   screen passes and running plays near the line of scrimmage. The answer
   may actually be both.

   And even if Jones only ends up excelling in one of those areas, which
   seems unlikely, he will still bring tremendous value to Strong's
   secondary, as he can run and strike, alternately wrapping up and
   driving defenders back and delivering big strikes as an enforcer over
   the middle, along there, or wherever he may find . Instincts, closing
   speed, it's all there.

   Sometimes, the best plays are the little ones -- in one highlight, the
   Nacogdoches opponent opts to sky kick away from Jones, who sprints up
   the sideline to decleat an opponent with one block, then finds another
   target, still at full speed.

   As a sophomore, he ran a 4.56 40-yard dash at the Houston NFTC, posting
   a 4.36 shuttle and a 34-inch vertical as well. As a junior, he ran a
   10.78 100m, and based on his senior film, it wouldn't be a surprise if
   he could now best all of those numbers -- that's just how hard he
   trains. In any case, his film speaks in a louder and more strident
   language than any testing numbers need to for Jones.

   As the consensus No. 40 prospect nationally and the No. 1 safety, Jones
   is the highest-rated pledge in the 2016 class for Texas and although he
   may not be the most crucial addition to the 24-man group, the line in
   front of Jones is not a long one. In the Internet era of recruiting,
   he's the highest-rated safety the Longhorns have landed besides Drew
   Kelson in 2004. Kelson was the No. 1 safety and the No. 28 prospect
   overall, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings. Just a little
   perspective there -- he's arguably the most important safety signee for
   the Longhorns in well more than a decade.

   Since the Longhorns desperately need an upgrade at both safety
   positions from what Strong and defensive coordinator Vance Bedford
   received last year from starters [97]Jason Hall and [98]Dylan Haines,
   Jones has an excellent chance to play early and often for Texas. And
   all signs point to the Nacogdoches product maximizing his unbelievable
   talent and joining the long line of greats at DBU.
