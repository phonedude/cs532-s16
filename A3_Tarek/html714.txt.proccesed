We Hate Autoplay Too: 3 Experts on Landing Page Video Best Practices

   Autoplay video seems to be growing in popularity, despite unanimously
   being seen as a real pain in the butt. We've all scrambled red-faced
   for the mute button at one time or another, and we know first-hand that
   it flat out annoying - and even embarrassing.

   This guy's not a fan of your autoplay videos. [19]Image source.

   But does that embarrassment translate to a dip in conversions on your
   [20]landing page?

   We asked three [21]landing page video experts this question, along with
   other questions to help you make the most of your investment in a
   [22]landing page video. Here's the advice they shared.

   Spoiler: the first five [23]seconds of your video are more important
   than you may think.

What can video do that text can't?

   Let's start at the beginning: why video?

   We all know that many [24]landing page visitors are skimmers, glancing
   over text and images to get a quick sense of your [25]unique value
   proposition. Why would we ask our users to spend an additional minute
   or two watching a video?

     Videos are the |ab0158f1983a26a9533350a0b657b3a0|

   That's from Maneesh Garg, Digital Marketing Manager at video production
   company [26]Broadcast2World.

   As he explained, when your users watch a video, they get so much more
   information than they would by simply reading text. They get:
     * A |de226405f1fb19c3ea0ffe3f6c35f9d3| of your product.
     * An |af58f2c466e81a10dd94200d17e78cd7| to your company through video
       components like color and music.
     * The opportunity to |6fb1bb1e125ce6dfb479c9616ad2c30d|--according to
       the [27]University of Alabama at Birmingham, 30 percent of the
       population understands and retains information better by listening
       than by reading.

   There's |5f959a8af54257d42a4699a419176c05|of using video on your
   landing page, and we'll let Sarah Nochimowski, Marketing Manager at
   ecommerce video platform [28]Treepodia, explain it:

     |4abff6815b859c741a49271482ca3d80| filling the void created in the
     online world by disconnecting from a physical store. This results in
     sales conversion increases.

   In other words:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Adding a video to your landing page is like adding a salesperson.
   [29]Click To Tweet
     __________________________________________________________________

   Take a look at this [30]explainer video from [31]Tapinfluence. It has a
   friendly, personable salesperson acting as your guide, along with a
   walkthrough that'll give you a visual understanding of the product:

   IFRAME: [32]https://player.vimeo.com/video/97870239

   That's what a landing page video can do that text can't. Are you ready
   to learn more?
   |a62ea339e60c114ad4f5c334c3faacb5|

   "We recommend 30-second videos," Nochimowski told me.

   She cited a statistic from [33]The New York Times/Visible Measures that
   indicated 19.4 percent of users stop watching video after the first 10
   seconds, and 44 percent stop watching after 60 seconds.

     This basically means that it's crucial to
     |c2213fd980f1165adde3a32ec6f672b5|

   "The first five seconds are crucial enough for people to decide if they
   want to proceed further or not," Garg went on to explain. "If you make
   the first five seconds of your video interesting, it's very likely that
   most people will watch your video all the way to the end and take
   further action, which you want them to do through your [34]call to
   action."

   Here's an example of a landing page video that Broadcast2Video created
   for [35]LockerGenie. Pay close attention to the first five seconds:

   IFRAME: [36]https://player.vimeo.com/video/130489010

   Not only do they |0103c2c212219e611b3d405da1b41bb3|, but the
   five-second mark ends right as the cartoon man is running across the
   screen with an armful of laundry.

   You want to know what's going to happen to him, right? That's
   |6a8e7a399810783057a4a947b1a4e5bd|-- you're curious about what's going
   to happen next, and you are putting emotional stakes into this cartoon
   man's journey.

   Broadcast2Video and LockerGenie used the first five seconds of this
   video to relate to prospects and then build investment in the story to
   keep `em watching.
   |1a123f29b0bb411a3cb92b06916439c0|

   Who among us hasn't lunged for our headphone jack or mute button after
   opening a page that contains an unexpected autoplay video? Well, it
   turns out that |e4c9fac74b5fc632da4af1d3a2cab111|Nochimowski explained:

     This can be perceived as aggressive to the user.

   Garg added, "I believe that anything which is pushed on users irritates
   them and make them suspicious about your product or service."

   What's the best solution? Nochimowski suggests that "the best is to
   have a |2e0d6cb7cd3ccd2df00485f6d1c9e235|displayed on the landing pages
   (above the fold, for example)."

   Garg agrees, with a caveat:

     Ultimately, the only way to decide if your video should play
     automatically is to [37]A/B test|2dc5fec53c229f728cf540752d7549c3|
     of your video landing page; one with an auto-play video and another
     that gives users control over landing page elements like video.

   Conversion optimization blog [38]ConversionXL suggests that Facebook
   and Twitter's recent adoption of autoplay video might [39]prime your
   users to be more accepting of autoplay.

   Video production company [40]Basetwo Media reminds us that Facebook and
   Twitter often use [41]silent autoplay video (that is, the user sees the
   video play automatically but has to manually activate the sound), which
   is one more option for you to consider -- and test!

   Here's one more video data point for you: Treepodia's research states
   that adding a play icon to your video
   |21d57698c8bc2c1be67af0b4c0299141|. So if you decide against autoplay,
   make sure your prospects know they're supposed to press play.
   |319da582d80b7b48ffaad1aeb363886e|

   |4d43ad578eabf7f347c772d1a271a5f7|In our experience, when used on
   landing pages, animated videos convert significantly higher than
   live-action videos," Garg told me. "Animation is simply more conducive
   to helping your target audience understand your brand, product, or
   idea, which is why explainer videos are so successful."

   What can animation do that live action can't? Garg explained that
   animation helps you communicate ideas with "simplicity and the right
   emotions." He also notes that animation is often best for
   |d6acbb4e3cf100b141d71bacc5e9fd39|

   Check out how user analytics company [42]CrazyEgg uses simple
   animations and lighthearted emotional pull to explain how heatmaps
   work:

   IFRAME: [43]https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cL2DzEdyMQ

   Does animation always outperform live-action?

   As with autoplay video, |0ad2df84fe41686b6da5469fe6f02c35|

   As Nochimowski puts it:

     We create animated videos but we also give our clients the option to
     upload full-production videos and let them be A/B tested one against
     the other. Results vary; sometimes
     |7f0c5b57fe0a44178df02711abaf6189|

   |397a6123cca77e2b91d6c3459a1c3d76|

   "When buying products, |5b4ff52e48b4e1bfdc06e4a78a8b69f6| I believe it
   needs to be the most practical and useful as possible," Nochimowski
   stated.

   Unbounce's Oli Gardner calls this the [44]hero shot:

     A visual representation of your offer that demonstrates how your
     product or service actually works so your prospects can picture
     themselves using it.

   Here's a video from [45]Screenr that shows the hero shot in action:

   IFRAME: [46]https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCs7KWgL-Bo

   After watching that video, you can picture yourself using Screenr,
   right? You can picture exactly how using it will help solve your
   screencasting woes. That's why the hero shot works.

   As Unbounce's Oli Gardner put it:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Your hero shot should sell the hell out of your product. Make it clear
   & dominant.

   If you aren't yet sold on the idea of adding landing page video to your
   website, here's one more fact for you, from Treepodia: according to an
   [48]Adobe Digital Report, 61 percent of businesses indicate online
   video as their |5ec9d5cea8e7d50bdc4fd37929cfa353|

   So now you know |4e20d00986e818ac4a3e6a1bde282b6b| and you have tips to
   help you |cacbbea8cb4df4a523240f6fee85f758|

   Are you ready to start thinking about adding video to your landing
   pages? If not, it's time to read this article again -- or maybe we
   should have made it into a 30-second video!
