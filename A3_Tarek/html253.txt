To date, the needle of the global compass points at Mohenjo-Daro, a remarkably advanced city built around 2,600BC in the Indus Valley. Abandoned just 700 years later, it lay buried until its rediscovery in 1922. The pool may have been a public bath, of course, yet for thousands of years, public baths and swimming pools have often been one and the same thing. A touch ironically, the city and its pool, located in what is Pakistan today, appear to have vanished in a great flood.</p><p>The most impressive public swimming pool built in recent years is surely the Aquatics Centre, designed by Zaha Hadid for the London 2012 Olympics. This beautiful, wave-like concrete, glass and timber-ceilinged building opened to the public this month and to the evident delight of thousands of schoolchildren from the east of the city who have had very few places to swim locally until now.</p><p>A fear of water &minus; and even a fear of personal hygiene &minus; held back the development of public baths and swimming pools in many countries until very recently. In fact, the modern craving for pools really only began with the re-invention of the Olympic Games, held in Athens, in 1896. From then on, towns and cities of advanced nations appeared to vie with one another to see which could build the best and most opulent pools.</p><p><strong>Bread and circuses</strong></p><p>Naturally, the burghers and architects of such towns and cities turned to Ancient Rome for precedence and guidance, for the greatest bathing and swimming complexes were built under the direction of extravagant Roman emperors. The Baths of Caracalla, dating from the early 3rd Century and those of Diocletian, from around a century later, must have been stunning places to visit. Featuring hot and cold pools, spas, gyms, restaurants, libraries and fecund walled gardens, and designed in the very grandest of architectural styles, these vast buildings were open to everyone. They were at the heart of the imperial Roman policy of &lsquo;bread and circuses&rsquo;: keeping the people docile by lavishing them with free food and popular entertainment.</p><p>Today, lucky bathers taking a dip in the exquisite underground pool of the distinctly private RAC Club in London&rsquo;s Pall Mall, do so in surroundings that, although built and decorated shortly before World War I, recall those hedonistic days of Roman bathing. British cities up and down the country invested in ambitious public baths at much the same time as the palatial Royal Automobile Club Club was on the drawing boards of Mewes and Davies, among England&rsquo;s finest Edwardian architects, and best known perhaps for London&rsquo;s Ritz Hotel. They went on to design Pompeian style swimming pools for ocean liners during the heyday of these imperious floating palaces.</p><p><strong>Eastern promises</strong></p><p>Grand, architect-designed baths can be found around the world, ranging from the magnificently austere to the decoratively decadent and overwhelmingly kitsch. One of the most gloriously grand baths can be found in the Art Nouveau-style Gellert Hotel in Budapest, rising from the site of an ancient thermal spring. The baths, completed in 1918, stayed open throughout the turmoil of World War II and, though the hotel itself was rather run down during the Cold War years, the baths remained as opulent as they had ever been, a steamy, watery realm in which hotel guests and the public alike could forget, for a few hours at a time, that they lived under the yoke of the Soviet Union.</p><p>One of the most remarkable public pools of all time &minus; the world&rsquo;s largest &ndash; could once be found in the very heart of the Soviet Union. This was the deeply curious open pool lapping in the foundations of what was to have been the Palace of the Soviets in central Moscow, a monumental congress hall, taller than the Empire State Building, that was to have been topped by a 100m statue of Lenin. The site of the proposed building, designed by Boris Iofan, was that of the 19th Century Orthodox Cathedral of Christ the Saviour: on Stalin&rsquo;s orders, this was blown up in December 1931. The palace was never built, while the pool remained open until work began on an identical replacement for the desecrated cathedral in 1995. So here was a ghostly architectural pool, where swimmers could imagine the immense bulk of either the Palace of Soviets or the Orthodox cathedral above their heads as they gazed at the Moscow skyline, heads in the snow, bodies in warm water.</p><p>I was wholly entranced in the elemental beauty of the Thermal Baths at Vals in Switzerland. Designed by Peter Zumthor, and opened in 1996, this dream-like spa is built into the landscape like some strange, yet enchanting geological outcrop. Its dark, locally quarried stone walls gleaming with quartz, form a series of gently lit underground caverns. You negotiate these ethereal spaces before swimming up into an open pool with a view of snow-capped mountains. It is a truly sensational experience conjuring a feeling of near profound delight as opposed to the splashes, spills and thrills of many modern public and hotel pools decked out with all the latest, luridly coloured family fun flumes and scream-a-minute rides.&nbsp;</p><p>In the UK, the Thermae Baths Spa offers a very different view than that of the Swiss Alps, from its rooftop pool. Designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and opened in 2006, the ultra-modern and supremely sleek New Royal Bath is set within an architectural frame of restored 18th Century spa buildings. This ensemble works well, especially for swimmers popping up to find themselves outdoors on the roof of the new building and surrounded by the buildings of one of Europe&rsquo;s finest historic city centres.</p><p>More discreet and easily overlooked by visitors to Helsinki is the city&rsquo;s Yrj&ouml;nkatu baths, its modest entrance tucked into a corner of a street in the looming shadow of the famous Torni Hotel where Cold War spies once swapped secrets &minus; or so it&rsquo;s fun to believe &minus; as regulars dived into the waters of the city&rsquo;s first public pool. Opened in 1928, the Yrj&ouml;nkatu baths were designed by the architect Vaino Vahakallio in a confident 1920s neo-classical style, as simple as the Gellert Baths are ornate.</p><p>Vahakallio was also the architect of the astonishing state-owned Alko distillery and brew house on the waterfront in Helsinki. Resembling a power station this, significantly or not, was Finland&rsquo;s biggest building to date, offering citizens of a country squeezed with its back to the Baltic by the brute power of Stalin&rsquo;s neighbouring Soviet Union, welcome solace in 1920, just as the Yrj&ouml;nkatu baths had done in the 1920s, when prohibition kept Finland &lsquo;dry&rsquo;.</p><p>All great, architect-designed or architecture-related pools have offered something of these special sensory and tactile delights. From spick-and-span and slightly chilly 1930s English Lidos and ambitious structures designed for Olympic Games, to the loucheness and sensuality of Ancient Roman and Art Nouveau baths, public pools have been some of the most diverting of buildings, with Zaha Hadid&rsquo;s alluring Aquatics Centre &minus; emerging from a tangled, rough-and-ready patch of east London &minus; only the latest in a long line stretching back through the Baths of Caracalla to that of Mohenjo-Daro, as dry as parchment today, 5,000 years later.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else

a child many of my favourite books had food as a theme. One in particular told the story of a boy who helped save his local burger bar by becoming a gastro-sleuth to track down a lost secret ingredient.</p><p>Long after losing track of the book and forgetting its title, I found myself in Edinburgh to interview Alexander McCall Smith. He was already the mega-selling author of The No 1 Ladies&rsquo; Detective Agency series, but years earlier, he had published a few children&rsquo;s books. There among them on a shelf was The Perfect Hamburger.</p><p>It was my book. Except that it wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; not really. While burgers do indeed feature in lip-smacking detail, this time it was clear to me that The Perfect Hamburger is actually a tale of corporate greed and the fate of small businesses forced to compete with big chains.</p><p>Revisiting kids&rsquo; books in adulthood can yield all sorts of weird and wonderful subtexts, some more obvious than others. How could Dr Seuss&rsquo;s How the Grinch Stole Christmas be anything other than a parable of consumerism? Why would it not seem blindingly clear that CS Lewis&rsquo;s The Chronicles of Narnia are in fact a fantastical re-imagining of Christian theology?</p><p>Similar close readings have rendered the Paddington Bear books fables about immigration and Babar the Elephant an endorsement of French colonialism. Alice&rsquo;s Wonderland adventures have been seen as everything from a paean to mathematical logic to a satire about the War of the Roses or a trippy caper with drugs as an underlying theme. And what about The Little Engine That Could? You might know it as a story about trains that fosters can-do optimism, but it has also been taken as a you-go-girl feminist tale. (The eponymous little engine is a lady train and when she breaks down, only another female train will stop to help out.) As for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: why, it&rsquo;s an allegorical representation of the debate surrounding late 19th Century US monetary policy, of course.</p><p><strong>Digging deep</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to poke fun at some of these more outlandish readings. Could they perhaps be the products of parents so addled by a text that, following their umpteenth nightly recital, the words start acting like one of those magic-eye images? Stare at them long enough and sense will materialise. Or nonsense. How else could a 22-page picture book like The Very Hungry Caterpillar yield capitalist, Christian, feminist, Marxist, queer and anti-liberal messages?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01vn57q\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can ever dig too deeply for meaning,&rdquo; says Dr Alison Waller, Senior Lecturer at the University of Roehampton&rsquo;s National Centre of Research for Children&rsquo;s Literature. Her favourite class involves applying psychoanalytical theory to Judith Kerr&rsquo;s The Tiger Who Came to Tea, resulting in some decidedly Oedipal interpretations of that big cat and his relationship to the family.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a very simple story, but simplicity is not the same as a lack of depth. There are some exquisite picture books that tackle existential issues like death and sadness head on: Michael Rosen&rsquo;s Sad Book and The Red Tree by Shaun Tan are great examples.&rdquo; Just because we might not be aware of such adult messages when we read books as kids, doesn&rsquo;t mean we aren&rsquo;t absorbing them, she adds. &ldquo;However far this kind of &lsquo;message&rsquo; seems to leap out at the adult reader, it is probably closer to the truth to say that the message has always been there but the knowledge that allows it to be recognised has not.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, sometimes meanings seem hidden because we&rsquo;re too caught up in the story, or because we&rsquo;re simply too young. Only as an adult does Waller recognise the motivation of Max&rsquo;s mother in sending him to bed without supper when she reads Maurice Sendak&rsquo;s Where the Wild Things Are.</p><p>Such layered meanings are crucial to the longevity of stories that become classics, fairy tales being a prime example. According to the Austrian-American psychoanalytic thoerist Bruno Bettelheim, Hansel and Gretel is far more than an account of parents who abandon their offspring and the evil witch who tries to kill them. It is about children&rsquo;s regression and &nbsp;&lsquo;oral greed&rsquo;, about separation anxiety and starvation fear. Bettelheim&rsquo;s 1976 study The Uses of Enchantment explains the therapeutic importance of fairy tales in children&rsquo;s education. Applying neo-Freudian analysis to stories including Cinderella and Snow White, he showed how these narratives address the unconscious in a language similar to dreams, helping kids deal with a plethora of unspoken fears and desires, from sibling rivalry to ambivalence toward their parents.</p><p><strong>No age limit</strong></p><p>So-called children&rsquo;s literature has plenty to offer adults, too argues Dr Sheldon Cashdan, professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. As he explains in his book The Witch Must Die: The Hidden Meaning of Fairy Tales, these stories enable kids to see the struggle between good and bad &ndash; a struggle that they feel within themselves &ndash; acted out on the page, with good prevailing and the witch meeting an invariably gruesome end.</p><p>These battles persist throughout life. &ldquo;Notions of greed, of wanting more than you actually need &ndash; you can see this in the bonuses of hedge fund managers and [people who have] houses with five bathrooms. Or the subtle, maybe not so subtle, ways that people lie &ndash; dating and telling things that aren&rsquo;t exactly true, fudging their income tax returns&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01vn5bn\"}}</p><p>To underscore his point, he&rsquo;s just published a novel called Emma von N, about a woman who goes into therapy with Freud as a young girl then returns as an adult and becomes Freud&rsquo;s mistress. She is consumed by fairy tales and constantly refers to them, finding them useful metaphors for all that life throws at her. Even when she&rsquo;s trapped in a miserable arranged marriage, she can imagine herself to be the heroine of Rumpelstiltskin, awaiting the one who will help her spin gold from straw.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only as adults that we make the mistake of thinking that children&rsquo;s literature, along with fairy tales, is essentially escapist. When we pick these books up decades later, we&rsquo;re surprised to learn what we doubtless always sensed as kids, even if we lacked the vocabulary to articulate it: that these stories are about eternal human strengths and weaknesses, about how to exist in the world.</p><p>Then again, the hidden nature of their messages is crucial to their magic. As Bettelheim noted, explaining to a child what makes a story so captivating would ruin it. Its power to enchant &ldquo;depends to a considerable degree on the child&rsquo;s not quite knowing why he is delighted by it&rdquo;.</p><p>In other words, the next time your children nag you to read The Very Hungry Caterpillar at bedtime, think of it as the tale of one creature&rsquo;s obsessive-compulsive quest to fill a hole that can&rsquo;t be filled, or as a prose poem about demonic possession &ndash; just be sure to stick to the words on the page.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The hidden messages in children’s books","HeadlineShort":"Hidden messages in kids’ books","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Adults often find surprising subtexts in children’s literature – but are they really there?

Just as Netflix made binge viewing of television popular, book publishers are now looking to feed readers&rsquo; craving for sequels to beloved novel series by releasing follow-up instalments more quickly than ever before. Call it binge reading, a concept that, up until now, was only possible with series that already had multiple volumes on bookstore shelves.</p><p>Publishers know a feeding frenzy when they see one. Fans of suspenseful series like Divergent and The Hunger Games devoured those books as soon as they were published, even with a wait of a year or morebetween sequels. So did Game of Thrones readers. But those fans are also notorious for complaining about author George RR Martin&rsquo;s slowness in finishing the saga&rsquo;s final two books. Blogger <a href=\"http://bookrockbetty.com/2014/01/20/bestbookseries/\">Book Rock Betty</a> writes, &ldquo;Sometimes I even hesitate picking up the next book of a series as soon as it is released because I know the wait for the next or final book will seem like an eternity.&rdquo; Publihsers have heard those complaints: &nbsp;the blockbuster success of EL James&rsquo; Fifty Shades of Grey series marked the advent of a new strategy aimed specifically at binge readers &ndash; the binge release. Unlike Thrones or The Hunger Games, all three Fifty Shades novels were released within six months.</p><p>I had my first experience of binge reading when I was 12. I would go to the library almost every day after school &ndash; in the last aisle on my left, I would crouch before the lowest shelves and pluck out the next in the mega-series <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/sweetvalley/\">Sweet Valley High</a>. I would take the battered copy to a nook in the back corner and read it, transforming myself from a baffled pre-teen into the beautiful blonde Wakefield twins, Elizabeth and Jessica. Soon, in my head, I&rsquo;d be careening around the streets of southern California in a red Fiat Spider convertible, squabbling about who can join the high school sorority. I would get through roughly one book per sitting, which was fine since there were about 50 of these published before I got to high school.</p><p>Today, it&rsquo;s even much easier to be a binge reader. The first instalment of Jeff VanderMeer&rsquo;s sci-fi series <a href=\"http://www.fsgoriginals.com/books/detail/annihilation\">Annihilation</a> hit shelves in February, with a second and third to arrive by September. Likewise, February thriller <a href=\"http://www.mistydwaters.com/p/archetype.html\">Archetype</a> by MD Waters will get a follow-up, Prototype, by July. Penguin Berkley and NAL Publishing Groups started a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BingeReads\">Binge Reads Facebook page</a> and a #bingereads hashtag to promote series fit for rapid consumption, like JR Ward&rsquo;s paranormal romance series, The Black Dagger Brotherhood and Fallen Angels. It seems to be working: the page already has nearly 10,000 fans after just a week online. It makes sense that a release cycle geared to bingeing is inviting for publishers &ndash; it means making more money in a shorter period. My experience bears this out: if I had to pay to get each new Sweet Valley High book, I would have shelled out as much of my allowance as fast as I could.</p><p><strong>Supply and demand</strong></p><p>Binge releasing works better with some series than others. Could publisher Random House have counted on holding the audience&rsquo;s interest for years on end with the Fifty Shades series? Better to strike while the S&amp;M fad is still hot. And in the case of my beloved Sweet Valley High &mdash; as well as countless contemporary teen series &mdash; the core audience will inevitably outgrow the obsession and move on.</p><p>A later-in-life reading encounter I experienced proves binge reading&rsquo;s financial incentive for publishers. I read Bridget Jones&rsquo;s Diary a little later than the rest of the world, in 2000, when it already had a sequel. This was lucky, since I ended up finishing the book in a matter of days during a business trip to Atlanta. I read at Starbucks, in the lift and under the covers of my hotel bed. I reluctantly took a break the next day to conduct some actual business, then rushed back to my bed, ordered room service and finished by about 10 pm.</p><p>I suddenly felt bereft without Bridget to keep me company. How many pounds was she losing now? Was she still in love with Mark Darcy? I brooded over these questions until I remembered that the answers were out there &ndash; Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason was on the shelves of a bookstore somewhere, waiting to give them to me. We used the internet differently in those days and I was in an unfamiliar city: I could neither find an open bookstore nor order online. I had to wait three long days until I returned to Chicago, rushed to my Barnes &amp; Noble and embraced my new friend once again. It barely mattered that the second book didn&rsquo;t live up to the first, as long as I felt like Bridget was still with me for a little longer. This is the kind of obsession on which publishers are banking.</p><p><strong>Mad about the book</strong></p><p>My Bridget Jones encounter highlights one of the best parts about binge-reading: it&rsquo;s an experience in which you suspend critical judgment and allow pure joy to take over. You like hanging out with these characters, regardless of their literary merit &ndash; which explains why many binge-reading candidates seem to fall into mainstream genre-fiction categories rather than being Nobel Prize winners. As the writer Phil Edwards <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-edwards/stop-bingewatching-and-st_b_4832548.html\">points out</a>: &ldquo;If you ask a&nbsp;House of Cards&nbsp;fan what happened in season two, episode four, they'll have no idea because they gorged too quickly. Binge-reading is the same thing, but with books. Practically, it can mean everything from skimming opening and closing paragraphs to completely skipping the stuff you don't like.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, go too crazy too fast with binge reading and you can feel as awful as you do after traditional bingeing on food and drink: overfilled, dazed and in need of sunlight and exercise. The good news? Even the worst binge reading has got to be among the most productive of binge behaviours. Yes, it may cause you to obsess a little &ndash; see <a href=\"http://www.fiftyshadesofgreyfan.org/\">Fifty Shades of Grey fans</a> &ndash; and it may make you feel irrationally close to the characters, as if you actually know them or even have lived their lives. But as someone who writes books for a living and has also been a life-long reader, I can tell you: that&rsquo;s the dream for both parties.</p><p>And sometimes a great book simply overtakes you, even if it&rsquo;s far from a guilty pleasure. When I read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Columbine-Dave-Cullen/dp/0446546925\">Dave Cullen&rsquo;s astonishing book Columbine</a>, a deep investigation into the 1999 school shootings in Littleton, Colorado, I stayed up several nights reading until I couldn&rsquo;t keep my eyes open then suffered terrible dreams when I nodded off. But Cullen&rsquo;s work was so great, and so terrifying, it literally kept me up at night; frankly, that felt like the most rational response to this particular story. Sometimes we need to escape the world, sometimes we need desperately to engage with it. The magic of books is that we can do both through them, with nary an extra calorie or hangover to show for it.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our</em><em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;<em>page or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\">Twitter</a>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:13:26Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"A mostly healthy obsession: The joy of binge reading","HeadlineShort":"The joy of binge reading","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Publishers are satisfying the demand for more books more quickly, reports Jennifer Armstrong, who shares her own experience of obsessive marathon reading.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwculture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":null,"RelatedTag":[],"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Publishers are satisfying the demand for more books more quickly, reports Jennifer Armstrong, who shares her own experience of obsessive marathon reading.","SummaryShort":"When page-turners become an obsession","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-10-21T08:13:26Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"beb3aba6-1885-4803-b992-c220974f7a68","Id":"wwculture/story/20140317-the-joy-of-binge-reading","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-08-18T11:00:12.960248Z","Project":"wwculture","Slug":"20140317-the-joy-of-binge-reading"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwculture/story/20140317-the-joy-of-binge-reading","_id":"56c5bc55d274b758aefdd5f7"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>A few years ago the director Wes Anderson was browsing the shelves of a bookshop in his adopted home of Paris when he made a chance discovery. He took down a copy of Beware of Pity, a 1939 novel by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, recently re-released in English after years out of print. &ldquo;I think I read the first page in the store and thought, &lsquo;OK, this is a new favourite writer of mine,&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/markets-festivals/wes-anderson-talks-about-his-grand-influences-1201091911/\">Anderson told Variety</a>.</p><p>When the credits roll at the end of Anderson&rsquo;s latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, the first one goes to Stefan Zweig, whose writings inspired it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically plagiarism,&rdquo; the director joked at a press conference before <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20140207-wes-andersons-new-hit-in-berlin\">the film&rsquo;s premiere at the Berlin Film Festival</a>. But it is actually a fantasia on themes from Zweig&rsquo;s life and works, a homage to the writer and his refined vision of Europe before World War II.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that Wes Anderson took so long to find Zweig, who until recently was almost forgotten in the English-speaking world. At the Strand Book Store in New York City (motto: &ldquo;18 miles of books!&rdquo;), there are currently just eight titles in stock. But in Dussmann, Berlin&rsquo;s vast &lsquo;cultural department store&rsquo;, Zweig&rsquo;s many works have a shelf all to themselves. In France, they have never been out of print. Until Pushkin Press and the New York Review of Books began to re-issue new editions in recent years, Zweig was known outside continental Europe by just a small group of literary aficionados and students in university German departments.</p><p>Zweig&rsquo;s fall from fame is remarkable given he was regularly billed as &lsquo;the world&rsquo;s most translated author&rsquo; throughout the 1920s and &lsquo;30s. His pacy novellas and vivid psychological biographies were international best-sellers, devoured by fans from London to Buenos Aires. His speaking engagements drew huge audiences and he could sell out New York&rsquo;s Carnegie Hall. He spoke regularly on the radio and was interviewed by the BBC in an early experiment with television in the &lsquo;30s. An avowed cosmopolitan, Zweig travelled extensively and knew all the major intellectual and artistic figures of the time, corresponding with Einstein and giving the eulogy at the funeral of Sigmund Freud.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tm3mj\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;He was one of the first star authors, and even in an age with no TV and very few pictures in the newspapers, people recognised him wherever he went,&rdquo; says Zweig&rsquo;s biographer Oliver Matuschek, who has spent 20 years researching the writer&rsquo;s life and works. &ldquo;The sheer volume is unbelievable,&rdquo; says Matuschek. &ldquo;In the collected works in German there are 36 volumes, and that doesn&rsquo;t include the 500 pieces of journalism that were published in newspapers and magazines in his lifetime.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Be my guest</strong></p><p>In many ways Zweig, the urbane man of letters who collected manuscripts by Goethe and owned Beethoven&rsquo;s desk, symbolises an idea of European sophistication that vanished with the Nazis&rsquo; rise to power. He was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Vienna in 1881 and his privileged background meant he could devote himself to writing without worrying about money. His popularity made him richer still and as his fame grew, he travelled widely to lecture and promote his books, staying in opulent hotels all over Europe. It is little wonder that so many of his stories play out in grand guesthouses.</p><p>&ldquo;The hotel is the best stage you could invent for a writer like Zweig,&rdquo; says Matuschek. &ldquo;There are all sorts of people there, from very grand guests to humble members of staff. And of course many of the people who read his books would never have stayed in a five-star hotel. But they would have had their own ideas and used their imagination to create this world.&rdquo;</p><p>In The Post-Office Girl, a lowly postal clerk in Austria after World War I receives an invitation to an Alpine resort, where she is intoxicated by the grand surroundings. She dresses up in fine clothes and affects the manners of the hotel&rsquo;s guests &ndash; but is sent packing in disgrace when her humble background is exposed. Zweig&rsquo;s 1927 novella 24 Hours in the Life of a Woman also revolves around a scandal in luxury lodgings, and like The Grand Budapest hotel, it is narrated as a story within a story, one of Zweig&rsquo;s favourite devices. Wes Anderson has borrowed from both works and from Zweig&rsquo;s contemporary Thomas Mann, whose rakish title character in The Confessions of Felix Krull rises from the modest station of lift-boy in a grand Parisian establishment by charming and seducing the wealthy guests.</p><p><strong>Gone but not forgotten</strong></p><p>The Grand Budapest Hotel builds to a rollicking finale, but there is an air of sadness that mirrors the sudden and tragic end to Zweig&rsquo;s life. Just a week after the fall of Singapore, at the height of World War II, newspapers across the world cleared room to report the news of his death. Many found space on the front page. His last years were lived in exile in Britain, the US and finally Brazil. Zweig read the writing on the wall with the rise of National Socialism and fled his home in Salzburg in 1934 before his beloved Austria was annexed by the German Reich. His books were banned and burned, and his citizenship revoked.</p><p>On the evening of 22 February 1942, Zweig and his second wife took a massive dose of barbiturates and lay down next to each other on their bed in Petr&oacute;polis near Rio de Janeiro. &ldquo;The world of my own language sank and was lost to me,&rdquo; he wrote in his suicide note, &ldquo;and my spiritual homeland Europe destroyed itself.&rdquo;</p><p>Zweig&rsquo;s slide into obscurity in the English-speaking world began shortly afterwards. Why did this happen? &ldquo;His books are very much products of pre-war Europe,&rdquo; says Adam Freudenheim, publisher and managing director of Pushkin Press. &ldquo;They probably didn't resonate very much in the 1940s to the &lsquo;60s.&rdquo; Another reason for his recent obscurity is the reluctance of readers in the US and UK to read literature in translation. Studies in both countries suggest that these books make up only 3-4% of total sales. And the quality of the previous translations &ndash; rendered in leaden, heavy-going prose &ndash; was also undoubtedly to blame. &ldquo;It's generally a good idea to have books re-translated every few decades,&rdquo; says Freudenheim. &ldquo;It does seem to be the case that languages &ndash; at least English &ndash; change enough that older translations can sometimes, perhaps often, feel stale.&rdquo;</p><p>Wes Anderson&rsquo;s new film is a new translation of sorts. He has boiled Zweig&rsquo;s life and works down to their marrow, and re-imagined them in his unique cinematic language. As artists, the two couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Zweig&rsquo;s works are serious, restless and psychological and they have the stiffly formal quality of his times. Wes Anderson&rsquo;s films are witty, cool and ironic, more concerned with surfaces than interiors. But despite its frothy tone and galloping pace, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a kind of monument &ndash; it begins, after all, in mock-sombre fashion with a teenage fan&rsquo;s pilgrimage to the statue of a great author. Wes Anderson&rsquo;s massive enthusiasm for his &ldquo;new favourite writer&rdquo; is there in every frame, and will turn a whole new audience on to a wonderful author we almost forgot.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-11T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Stefan Zweig: Grand Budapest Hotel’s inspiration","HeadlineShort":"The writer behind Budapest Hotel","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Stefan Zweig was once ‘the world’s most translated author’ – then he faded into obscurity in the English-speaking world.

Brian Godawa, a California filmmaker who specialises in spiritual stories, cares for the environment but speaks for many in the religious community when he says: &ldquo;Christians don&rsquo;t want their sacred story to be turned into a parable for environmentalism!&rdquo;</p><p>In recent years accusations of a perceived agenda have been made against a wide range of Hollywood movies. Sometimes the charges come as a surprise. The creators of 2011&rsquo;s Happy Feet Two, a children&rsquo;s story about a penguin reluctant to dance, found a Christian movie website had judged their film to be loaded with messages.&nbsp; According to Movieguide: The Family Guide To Movie Reviews, the picture had a &ldquo;very strong mixed pagan, politically correct worldview promoting homosexual same-sex partnerships and homosexual adoption and promoting radical environmentalism and global warming hysteria throughout.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Building blocks of criticism</strong></p><p>One of the more frequently voiced complaints is that Hollywood films have a left-wing agenda. Even though it has made handsome profits with box office takings in excess of $360m worldwide, enough to make any capitalist happy, The Lego Movie, released last month, was singled out as being &ldquo;practically communist&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/lego-movies-antidote-to-kids-movie-clichs.html\">by one American reviewer</a> who was by no means alone in his assessment.</p><p>This children&rsquo;s animation, populated by characters made up of the well-known interlocking toy bricks, has as its prime antagonist a rather unpleasant CEO called President Business, voiced by Will Ferrell. The film satirises corporate practice. Charles Payne, a contributor to the Fox Business Network, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rprB_VNm3L8\">expressed grave concern</a> over the content of The Lego Movie. On the air he declared: &ldquo;Hollywood has its own agenda and we&rsquo;re used to this, but it feels a little bit more threatening when they start to push this out to our kids over and over.&rdquo;</p><p>The Lego Movie is part of what Hollywood&rsquo;s critics might call its ongoing anti-corporate, pro-liberal agenda &ndash; a trend that&rsquo;s been evident for decades. As far back as 1936, Charlie Chaplin brought moviegoers a satire of industrial capitalism with his classic Modern Times, in which he played a worker with no autonomy stripped of his dignity on an assembly line.</p><p>Much more recently, in 2008 the Disney animated picture Wall-E was described as anti-capitalist &ndash; or anti-consumption &ndash; because it featured video-addicted humans too fat to walk and controlled by a gigantic corporation that had rendered them moronic.</p><p>The following year brought director James Cameron&rsquo;s Avatar which was described as Marxist in some circles. It depicted a US mining corporation cruelly expanding its activities on the planet Pandora, threatening the indigenous people and its ecosystem.</p><p>Many of the films with alleged anti-corporate subtexts are made by Hollywood studios who are part of big media conglomerates. It&rsquo;s interesting to ponder whether or not studio executives fully recognise the content of so-called &lsquo;subversive&rsquo; pictures before they give them the green light. Did Warner Bros, for instance, scrutinise The Lego Movie's screenplay and see that it had what many are describing as an overtly anti-corporate subtext &ndash; and, if so, did they care?</p><p>Noah Gittell, who writes on films and politics for The Atlantic thinks &ldquo;they probably did see it. I think it&rsquo;s a delicate thing, and I&rsquo;m not sure whether these movies really push an anti-corporate message or whether this is a case of an industry co-opting that message, and I think the jury&rsquo;s still out on that one,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>These allegedly anti-business films are perhaps in some way trying to tap into topical anxieties. Opinion polls show that Americans, while concerned about corporate influence, see big government and its impact on their lives as a greater threat. But it is true that in many communities Americans routinely deal with faceless corporations in areas of life where they used to turn to individuals or smaller institutions. This can cause frustration and isparticularly true in areas of health care and education.</p><p>To Gittell, Hollywood is responding to real concerns. &ldquo;Americans and other people around the world have grown weary and skeptical of corporate influence,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s reflecting that in our films. The cluster of films that exist is evidence that Hollywood thinks this is a message America wants to hear right now.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Corporate cosmology</strong></p><p>Studios may well be backing films that have ostensibly anti-business themes because in reality they&rsquo;re very corporate friendly.&nbsp; Toby Miller, author of Global Hollywood 2, thinks The Lego Movie is hardly anti-corporate, especially when you discover the true colours of the demonised CEO.&nbsp; &ldquo;The supposedly nasty corporate figure turns out to be loving, malleable, pliant and even a good dad,&rdquo; he says. The picture is also designed to promote consumption. Miller notes, &ldquo;The entire movie is about Lego and how Lego is a wonderful toy &ndash; it&rsquo;s a commercial.&rdquo;</p><p>In a way the peddling of these allegedly subversive films shows just how accommodating corporate capitalism can be in generating profits by selling consumers a film that appears to be anti-establishment.</p><p>&ldquo;Corporate bashing in movies is something that corporations are very good at making money on,&rdquo; says political essayist Emmett Rensin. &ldquo;This has been true for a long time. Very large corporations are good at actually profiting off of criticism of themselves by selling it to people.&nbsp; You can buy your counterculture from a mainstream cultural institution which maybe neutralises it to some extent.&rdquo;</p><p>Studios only really get significantly involved in patrolling films deemed to have an &ldquo;agenda&rdquo; if there&rsquo;s a threat to the box office. Darren Aronofsky has made it clear that he wants to depict Noah as &ldquo;the first environmentalist.&rdquo; Mindful this could alienate religious audiences, a key group that Paramount Pictures is targeting, the studio has for quite some time been engaged in reportedly tense negotiations with Aronofsky over the film&rsquo;s storyline.</p><p>Really, the bottom line for Hollywood is that so long as its films make money, there&rsquo;s little concern over content. Also, Hollywood is hardly an anti-establishment agitating force &ndash; the studios are not going to back films which encourage the citizenry to rise up &ndash; but this doesn&rsquo;t mean the satire that emerges is neutral or lame.</p><p>Eric Brown, a political writer at the <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/\">International Business Times</a>, clearly sees The Lego Movie&rsquo;s theme song Everything is Awesome as an astute reflection on corporate control. It satirises an obedient citizenry that behaves well and allows itself to be exploited by corporations &ndash; all with the aim of making money.&nbsp; The refrain is the kind of anthem you&rsquo;d expect to hear employees with happy faces singing at a US corporate retreat: &ldquo;Everything is awesome. Everything is cool when you're part of a team. Everything is awesome, when we're living our dream!&rdquo;</p><p>So the news that there&rsquo;s now going to be a sequel in the wake of the spectacular success of The Lego Movie may possibly have prompted life to imitate art in Hollywood with some in the film world responding with the rejoinder: &ldquo;Everything is awesome!&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-12T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Do Noah and The Lego Movie have hidden agendas?","HeadlineShort":"Blockbusters with hidden agendas?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Critics claim recent films contain subversive political messages.

But in adulthood that joy tends to become a forgotten pleasure. We have so little time to read and there are so many great books that we&rsquo;ve yet to get around to (War and Peace looms large on my literary guilt list&minus; never mind the ceaseless tide of new releases). You could read a book a day for the rest of your life and still not make it through even a quarter of the titles published in 2013 in the UK alone. With the shelves thus groaning, pulling down a well-thumbed favourite feels an unconscionable indulgence.</p><p>Yet if my admittedly unscientific research on Facebook is anything to go by, furtive re-readers are everywhere in our midst. For certain fans, re-reading The Lord of the Rings is an annual ritual. Devotees of The Great Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice and Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles also return regularly to the book they prize above all others. One friend told me that Jane Austen&rsquo;s Emma can still surprise him, despite his having reading it over 50 times. Another literally read to bits her copy of Leo Rosten&rsquo;s comic masterpiece, The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N.</p><p>Now, two new bibliomemoirs have arrived to showcase the insights &ndash; both literary and personal &ndash; that are to be gained from that ultimate guilty pleasure: re-reading. Journalist Rebecca Mead, a long-time Englishwoman in New York, first encountered George Eliot&rsquo;s Middlemarch at 17. Since then, she has read it again every five years. With each re-reading, it has opened up further; in each chapter of her life &ndash; as she itched to leave home, as she moved to America, had love affairs and become a mother &ndash; it has resonated differently.</p><p>Reaching her 40s, Mead decided on a fresh approach: she would apply the tools of her day job to this private passion. Her aim was to discover what writing the novel meant to Eliot, and how reading it has shaped her own life. She chronicles her relationship in The Road to Middlemarch (published in the US as My Life in Middlemarch), a delightful book filled with sharp observations and told in a voice poised between chatty confidant and brilliant teacher.</p><p>Playwright Samantha Ellis has clocked up even more time with Wuthering Heights. She was 12 when she first read Emily Bront&euml;&rsquo;s gothic romance, and without fail, she&rsquo;s returned to it annually in the run-up to her birthday. This year when she will turn 39 might just be the first time that she skips it, but only because all those re-readings have now inspired a book, How to Be a Heroine.</p><p>It begins with a heated conversation Ellis had with her best friend while on a pilgrimage to Yorkshire in the north of England, where the novel is set. Which heroine was best, Jane Eyre or Cathy Earnshaw? As they quarrelled, Ellis realised she&rsquo;d spent her life trying to be Cathy when Jane was a far savvier role model. This sets her off on another journey, back to the books that shaped her ideas about how to move through the world as a woman. It&rsquo;s a risky enterprise because, just as Mead knows, though the words on the page stay the same, our readings of them change.</p><p><strong>Security blanket</strong></p><p>Both Mead and Ellis testify to the myriad ways in which really good books not only stand the test of repeat reads, but also bestow fresh gifts each time we crack their spines. These kinds of books grow with us. The writers also explore the motivations behind re-reading.</p><p>For children, it&rsquo;s a comfort. As we become accustomed to a world in which change is the only real constant, the familiarity of the book at bedtime is something to cling to. Adults aren&rsquo;t immune to those feelings, either. To quote the septuagenarian writer Larry McMurtry: &ldquo;If I once read for adventure, I now read for security. How nice to be able to return to what won&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;</p><p>Except that often, that&rsquo;s not quite the case. We notice fresh details. Our interpretations change as we evolve &ndash; cheerleading for the strivers, for instance, gives way to admiration for characters who are slow and steady.</p><p>Vladimir Nabokov had a theory about this. He believed that the process of moving our eyes from left to right, line after line, page after page, stood between us and artistic interpretation the first time round. By the fourth reading, the experience has apparently assumed more of the directness of looking at a painting. &ldquo;One cannot read a book: one can only re-read it,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Scientists have weighed in, too, citing the mental health benefits of re-reading. Research conducted with readers in the US and New Zealand found that on our first reading, we are preoccupied by the &lsquo;what?&rsquo; and the &lsquo;why?&rsquo;. Second time round, we&rsquo;re able to better savour the emotions that the plot continues to ignite. As researcher Cristel Russell of the American University explained of re-readers in an article published in the Journal of Consumer Research, returning to a book &ldquo;brings new or renewed appreciation of both the object of consumption and their self&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Heart of the matter</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s true that we often find former selves on the pages of old books (literally, if we&rsquo;re fond of scribbling in the margins). But even without the aid of marginalia, these texts can carry us back to a time and place, and remind us of the kind of person that we were then.</p><p>We&rsquo;re changed not only by lived experience but also by read experience &ndash; by the books that we&rsquo;ve discovered since last reading the one in our hand.</p><p>More so than the movie director or the musician, the writer calls upon our imaginations, using words to bid us picture this declaration of love or that betrayal. It&rsquo;s not surprising that in my social media poll, of the many and varied titles that people returned to, only one was non-fiction (Enemies of Promise, Cyril Connolly&rsquo;s hybrid of literary criticism and memoir). A book is a joint project between writer and reader, and for its alchemy to work, we must pour so much of ourselves into reading that our own life story can become braided with the story that&rsquo;s bound between the book&rsquo;s covers.</p><p>Perhaps what&rsquo;s really strange is that we don&rsquo;t re-read more often. After all, we watch our favourite films again and we wouldn&rsquo;t think of listening to an album only once. We treasure tatty old paperbacks as objects, yet of all art forms, literature alone is a largely one-time delight. A book, of course, takes up more time, but as Mead and Ellis confirm, the rewards make it amply worthwhile. They needn&rsquo;t be anointed classics, either. Sabbath&rsquo;s Theatre by Philip Roth, EL Doctorow&rsquo;s Ragtime and Donna Tartt&rsquo;s The Goldfinch are all on my re-reading list &ndash; just as soon as I&rsquo;ve finished War and Peace, that is.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCCulture\"><em>Facebook </em></a><em>page or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:13:26Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Re-reading: The ultimate guilty pleasure?","HeadlineShort":"Are you a re-reader?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"With so many books and so little time, re-reading seems an indulgence.

But music can be a devastating tool of psychological warfare, says Herbert Friedman, a former US army sergeant major who has researched the <a href=\"http://www.psywarrior.com/MusicUsePSYOP.html\">subject</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;There are two main purposes,&rdquo; Friedman told the <a href=\"https://audioboo.fm/boos/1979667-the-music-used-in-warfare#t=3m32s\">BBC&rsquo;s Today programme</a>. &ldquo;One is that for your side it&rsquo;s a great morale booster &ndash; it encourages your men to march forward, to fight. At the same time, it can terrify your enemy; it can keep them awake, lower their morale. It can actually confuse them, if the music is odd enough.&rdquo;</p><p>In his book <a href=\"http://www.jonronson.com/goats_04.html\">The Men Who Stare at Goats</a>, British journalist Jon Ronson documents how the US Army played music to Iraqi prisoners of war to disorient them before interrogation. Their selection ranged from Metallica&rsquo;s Enter Sandman to the I Love You song from the children&rsquo;s TV show Barney &amp; Friends.</p><p>In turn, the right choice of song can be a form of defence. British naval officers have found that blasting Britney Spears hits from their ships deters attacks by Somali pirates. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so effective the ship&rsquo;s security rarely needs to resort to firing guns,&rdquo; Second Officer Rachel Owens told <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/27/britney-spears-songs-used-to-scare-off-pirates-in-somalia-4163217/\">Metro</a>. &ldquo;As soon as the pirates get a blast of Britney, they move on as quickly as they can.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Show no mercy</strong></p><p>At the Battle of the Alamo in 1836, the Mexican General Santa Anna played El Deg&uuml;ello, a song that appealed to the enemy to surrender or die by the sword, in an attempt to frighten the Texan defenders into either fleeing or surrendering. &ldquo;It meant nobody survives, we kill everybody,&rdquo; says Friedman. &ldquo;When you heard that, you knew the line had been drawn and you&rsquo;d die.&rdquo;</p><p>During the siege of the Iraqi city of Fallujah in April 2004, Associated Press reported that US marines played songs including AC/DC&rsquo;s Hell&rsquo;s Bells to unnerve insurgents, while in 1989 American troops used <a href=\"http://www2.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/nsa/DOCUMENT/950206.htm\">rap and pop</a> &ndash; including Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley &ndash; to flush out the Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega from his hiding place in the Vatican Embassy.</p><p>Music has other uses in conflict besides aural assault. It can lift the spirits of soldiers and bond them together. During World War II, songs like When the Lights go on Again and Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition motivated Allied troops &ndash; while German forces listened to Wagner&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/arts/musreich.htm\">Ride of the Valkyries</a> for inspiration. The music by Hitler&rsquo;s favourite composer went on to feature in an iconic scene from the Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now &ndash; and was played by US troops in the 1991 Gulf War. &ldquo;Nobody can hear The Ride of the Valkyries without seeing the helicopters coming in,&rdquo; says Friedman. &ldquo;When we crossed the border in Desert Storm, our helicopters played it.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>&nbsp;page or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_culture\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-21T08:19:43Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Ear assault in Ukraine: Music as a weapon","HeadlineShort":"Ear assault: Music as a weapon","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"Ukrainians in Crimea have responded to Russian propaganda by blasting back the songs of Cher.

With a cast including Orson Welles, Mick Jagger and even Salvador Dal&iacute;, as well as a musical score by Pink Floyd, it has become one of the most famous movies never made.</p><p>&ldquo;They never rolled camera... They storyboarded the entire film from beginning to end &ndash; 3,000 images,&rdquo; says Frank Pavich, who has directed a documentary about the project. Jodorowsky&rsquo;s Dune features interviews with the director, producer and artists who worked on the project. It shows that a failure can still be a source of inspiration.</p><p>The storyboard artwork was collected in a book and sent out to studios. Although they loved the idea, the eccentric&nbsp; Jodorowsky bewildered them &ndash; his earlier films included the &lsquo;acid Western&rsquo; El Topo, and the surreal fable The Holy Mountain.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe the project was supposed to end there,&rdquo; says Pavich. &ldquo;And then those ideas came out of that book and started to infect the world to a certain extent, [to] inspire other films.&rdquo;</p><p>Jodorowsky&rsquo;s Dune was proposed in 1974, before Star Wars had proved that sci-fi films could be blockbusters, and is seen as the forerunner to movies like Alien and Bladerunner.

The future of one iconic seller is currently uncertain. The Polare bookstore in Maastricht came under threat when Polare &lt;a  href=&quot;http://www.nltimes.nl/2014/02/25/polare-bookstore-bankruptcy/&quot;&gt;declared bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; in February. It remains open for the time being under the name &#39;Boekhandel Dominicanen&#39; but staff have launched a &lt;a  href=&quot;http://www.polaregaatdoor.nl/dominicanen/&quot;&gt;crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; to save it from closure. Converted from a 13th Century Dominican church in 2006 by architects Merkx+Girod (now &lt;a  href=&quot;http://merk-x.nl/&quot;&gt;Merk X&lt;/a&gt;), Polare is a temple of books that raises reading to a religious experience.

To find their way into the 4,000 sq m underground space beneath Wutishan Stadium, visitors follow a yellow-striped road; inside, a replica of Rodin’s The Thinker sits alongside a cash till made out of old books, and pillars with famous literary verses carved into them. Another branch of the shop is housed inside Nanjing’s Presidential Palace – this one has managed to bring the palatial underground. (Photo: PR)"

Passersby could leave money in a coffee can. Now, the store has nearly 1m books – many of which are still sold through an honour system – as well as a courtyard where browsers can play chess under the shade of an apple tree. (Photo : PR)"

Named after a bookstore frequented by Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway and James Joyce during the 1920s, the shop on Paris’s Left Bank has become equally legendary. Opened in 1951 by the American George Whitman – and run by his daughter Sylvia since his death in 2011 – it became a gathering place for Beat Generation writers like Allen Ginsberg and William S Burroughs. From the start, Whitman allowed travelling artists and writers to lodge at the shop, which is also a lending library; the spirits of past authors haunt its crowded walls.
