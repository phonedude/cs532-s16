   [87]Submitted by Ingrid Carlqvist via The Gatestone Institute,
     * The atmosphere on Swedish social media is now almost revolutionary.
       People post videos of themselves accusing the government of murder,
       of filling Sweden with violent people.
     * When Alexandra Mezher was murdered, she was alone in the residence
       with ten asylum seekers. She was stabbed by one of the "children"
       she cared for.
     * When National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson appeared on the
       "Good Morning Sweden" TV show, the day after Mezher's murder, he
       expressed sympathy for the murderer, but barely mentioned the
       victim. This sparked frenzied outrage on social media.

   Mass immigration is continuing to claim victims in Sweden. Murder,
   assaults and rape have become everyday occurrences in this small
   country, with a population just short of ten million, which last year
   opened its doors to almost [88]163,000 immigrants. The latest victim is
   22-year-old Alexandra Mezher. She was stabbed to death last week by a
   so-called [89]unaccompanied refugee child at the asylum house where she
   worked.

   Although the massive influx of asylum seekers has decreased drastically
   since January 4, when Sweden implemented border controls on the
   Swedish/Danish border, the people who are already here pose a giant
   problem to municipalities, police and citizens. The police are
   [90]fighting a losing battle against street crime, as well as daily
   incidents at asylum houses - general disturbances that include fights,
   rapes and threats.

   The asylum houses are in a state of anarchy. On January 27, police were
   dispatched to a home for teenagers in Lindås, where a riot had erupted.
   Policeman Johan Nilsson [91]told the local paper, Barometern:

     "One [of the youths] was refused when he tried to buy candy, and got
     angry with the staff. He gathered some 15 friends, and the staff was
     forced to lock themselves in while the mob smashed windows and other
     things. The instigator, supposedly 16 years old, is suspected of
     having started the riot, and another one is suspected of making
     unlawful threats and of violent rioting."

   That suspect was later released, after producing a document that stated
   he was under 15, and thus not criminally responsible.

   Another, more serious incident occurred at the asylum house Signalisten
   in Västerås on January 20. Ten policemen arrived at the facility due to
   reports of the [92]repeated rape of a 10-year-old boy. The policemen
   were met by a large mob standing in a corridor, shouting and shaking
   their fists. The situation escalated to the point where the police were
   [93]forced to flee for their lives. One of the officers later wrote in
   his report that it was only due to the presence of a police dog handler
   that he and his colleagues were able to escape:

     "Even more people appeared behind us. I was mentally prepared to
     fight for my life. We were 10 police officers in a narrow corridor.
     And I heard someone yell that there is an emergency exit. I felt
     that we could easily have been outmaneuvered, considering the
     environment and the number of counterparties."

   The policeman also wrote in his report that he hoped for more training
   in the future, on "how to handle crowds in confined spaces."

   That the Swedish police are no longer able to do their duty is evident.
   National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson recently [94]demanded 2,500
   more officers and 1,600 more civilian employees for the police, to
   handle the heightened terror threat and the increased influx of
   refugees. Considering the length of time needed to train policemen, it
   will probably be a while before the police can increase its numbers.
   Eliasson also demanded a budget increase of between 1.8 and 2.8 billion
   kronor ($214 million - $332 million), because the "migrant situation
   means a significantly higher workload for the police."

   He [95]identified at border controls and asylum houses as especially in
   need of greater resources, all over the country: "We need to be there
   often, there are fights and disturbances."

   On January 26, what everyone had been dreading finally happened. The
   police arrived at an asylum house for "unaccompanied refugee children"
   in Mölndal early in the morning, after reports of a knife fight. By the
   time they arrived, it was too late. Asylum house employee Alexandra
   Mezher lay bleeding on the floor, [96]stabbed by one of the "children"
   she cared for. She died in hospital a few hours later.

   The police arrested a person claiming to be a 15-year-old from Somalia
   on suspicion of murder, as well as the attempted murder of one of the
   youths who allegedly tried to intervene. He was later [97]remanded.
   According to the local daily, GT, the staff had previously [98]warned
   on several occasions that the suspect had psychiatric problems.

   The Mezher family are Lebanese Christians who fled the violence in
   Lebanon 25 years ago. Alexandra's mother, Chimene Mezher, [99]told the
   British paper, The Daily Mail:

     "We left Lebanon to escape the civil war, the violence and the
     danger. We came to Sweden where it was safe, to start our family.
     But it is not safe any more. ... And I just want to know why... why
     Alexandra? She wanted to help them, but they did this. I just want
     answers."

   Chimene Mezher now accuses Swedish politicians of murdering her
   daughter. The dramatic recent population increase in Mölndal, a suburb
   of Gothenburg, has scared many of the 60,000 residents. In less than a
   year, 8,000 asylum seekers have moved in -- half of whom are so-called
   "unaccompanied refugee children."

   It has now emerged that staff at the asylum house where Alexandra
   Mezher was murdered had repeatedly complained about unreasonable
   conditions. A year ago, employees warned about being understaffed and
   working alone: "So far, nothing serious has happened, but it will,"
   [100]said a desperate employee who called the Health and Social Care
   Inspectorate ("Inspektionen för vård och omsorg" or IVO). IVO inspected
   the asylum house, but found everything was in order. When Mezher was
   murdered, she was alone in the residence with ten asylum seekers. So
   far, no motive for the murder has emerged.

   When the National Police Commissioner appeared on the "Good Morning
   Sweden" TV show, the day after Mezher's murder, he [101]expressed
   sympathy for the murderer, but barely mentioned the victim. This
   sparked frenzied outrage on social media. Eliasson said:

     "Well, you are of course distraught on behalf of everyone involved.
     Naturally, for the person killed and her family, but also for a lone
     young boy who commits such a heinous incident. What has that person
     been through? Under what circumstances has he grown up? What is the
     trauma he carries? This entire migration crisis shows how unfair
     life is in many parts of the world. We have to try to help solve
     this best we can."

   The atmosphere on social media is now almost revolutionary. People are
   posting videos of themselves accusing the government of murder, of
   filling Sweden with violent people and completely ignoring Swedes.

     Alexandra Mezher (left) was murdered in the home for "unaccompanied
      refugee children" where she worked. She was stabbed to death by a
   resident who claims to be 15 years old and from Somalia. When National
   Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson (right) spoke on television about the
    murder, he expressed sympathy for the murderer, but barely mentioned
                                 the victim.

   What does the Swedish government really think? Does it maintain that
   the right of asylum is more important than everything else -- even the
   safety of its own people?

   Gatestone Institute called Sofia Häggmark, a non-partisan official at
   the Department of Justice unit for migration rights. Here is the Q & A:

     Should everyone get to seek asylum in Sweden, even if it leads to
     Sweden's undoing?

     "The right of asylum is very strong. We have international rules and
     EU rules that say that if a person comes to an EU country, that
     person has a right to seek asylum."


     Is it all right to say no if there are groups in your country that
     are being threatened by the asylum seekers -- minority populations
     such as Roma, Jews and Sami [Lapp]? Or that Sweden cannot afford it?

     "No, if a person has grounds for asylum or risks the death penalty
     or torture in their home country, you cannot deny them asylum."


     Is it not the Swedish government's primary task to protect Sweden
     and the Swedish people?

     "We need to abide by international rules; we are obliged to do that.
     We can be dragged before the Court of Justice of the European Union
     if we do not allow people to seek asylum."


     Which is more important - Swedish lives, or the risk that you might
     end up before the Court of Justice of the European Union?

     "I cannot answer that question; I can only tell you what the rules
     are."


     So you are saying that if 30 million people come here to kill us, we
     have no defense, we cannot stop it?

     "I can only tell you that the right of asylum gives very strong
     protection."


     But not for the Swedes?

     "If a person kills someone here in Sweden, the criminal justice
     system handles that and tries them. We need to look at every
     individual asylum case."


     Do you think it has ever happened at any time in the history of the
     world that a country cared more for the citizens of other countries
     than its own?

     "I cannot answer that. But there is no rule that sets a limit for
     how many [asylum seekers] Sweden can accept."


     So there is no plan for what to do when the country is full and the
     citizens are scared?

     "No, there is not."


     Do you personally think that feels okay?

     "I cannot answer that. That is not my job."


     If several millions of Muslims come here and implement Sharia law,
     then the right of asylum has effectively contributed to abolishing
     the democracy in our country, replacing the Swedish people and
     annihilating the whole concept of Sweden. Have none of you pondered
     these fateful issues?

     "I understand your thoughts."

   The measures taken by the government on January 4 were a way to stop
   immigration without compromising the almighty "right of asylum,"
   because only those who actually set foot on Swedish soil have the right
   to seek asylum. The government imposed carriers' liability for the
   train and ferry companies operating on the route between Denmark and
   Sweden, which [102]means that those companies had to hire guards to
   refuse passage to anyone that cannot show a passport or other valid ID.
   This is the first time people cannot travel freely between the Nordic
   countries since the [103]Nordic Passport Union was introduced in 1952.

   The new identity checks have created a problem for Denmark, which was
   not at all keen to get stuck with all the asylum seekers headed for
   Sweden. Thus, Denmark introduced its own controls on the German border.

   Otherwise, Denmark has chosen a different path from Sweden. Instead of
   preventing people from seeking asylum, the Danish Parliament adopted
   [104]a new law on January 26, which includes sharp austerity measures
   towards asylum seekers - measures that the government hopes will
   discourage migrants from coming to Denmark. The new rules include:
     * Shorter residence permits
     * Postponement of the right to bring in relatives
     * The right of the state to seize a migrant's assets to cover asylum
       costs
     * Stricter qualifications to get permanent residency
     * An easing of the process for revoking the residency of refugees
     * A 10% cut in cash benefits for asylum seekers

   Even the Danish Social Democrats supported the law. In 2010, the party
   demanded that Europe "make way for Islam," but now it has apparently
   made a complete U-turn. Social Democratic Faction Chairman Henrik Sass
   Larsen wrote in an [105]opinion piece in the daily, Politiken:

     "We will do all we can to limit the number of non-Western refugees
     and immigrants to this country. That is why we have gone far - much
     farther - than we ever dreamed of. We do this because we do not want
     to sacrifice the welfare state in the name of humanism. Because the
     welfare state is ... the political project of the Social Democrats.
     It is a society built on the principles of freedom, equality and
     solidarity. Mass immigration - look at Sweden for example - will
     undermine the economic and social foundation of the welfare state."

   But protecting the welfare state that generations of Swedes have built,
   does not seem to be a priority for the Swedish Social Democrats. Some
   have long claimed that the Social Democratic affinity for immigration
   has to do with the party's desire to fill the country with "election
   cattle," and fuel has now been added to that fire. Muslims most often
   seem to vote for the left, studies show. For example, [106]93% of
   French Muslims voted for Socialist President François Hollande, and
   almost [107]90% of American Muslims voted for President Obama.

   Judging by recent polls, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven will
   indeed need the Muslim votes in order to remain in power. The respected
   polling institute, Sifo, recently presented a report on party
   sympathies for the month of January. The Social Democrats got a pitiful
   23.2% - the [108]worst result since polling started in 1967. The party
   got 31% in the [109]general election of 2014, and that was considered a
   rotten result.

   Meanwhile, after the new border controls were implemented in January,
   and the number of asylum seekers arriving in Sweden decreased from a
   peak of over 10,000 a week, to 820 (during the third week of January),
   no one could tell if this was due to the border controls or the wintry
   weather.

   In total, [110]162,877 people sought asylum in Sweden in 2015. That is
   almost twice as many as the year before and many times the average
   [111]during the 2000s, which was roughly 33,000 a year.

   Now, Minister for Home Affairs Anders Ygeman [112]tells the Dagens
   Industri business paper that he has tasked the police and the
   Immigration Service with the deportations of up to 80,000 of the asylum
   seekers who arrived last year. The government plans on using chartered
   planes. Anders Ygeman describes the operation as a "very big
   challenge."

   Assasination is an under-utilized form of protesting politicians'
   actions these days.  Obviously, I'm not advocating such barbarity, just
   observing that it doesn't seem to get used much in Western societies
   any more.  Seems overdue for a comeback.  Like bell bottoms.

   A basic, important point is being overlooked here:

   The core belief of the Government of Sweden is that people are, by
   nature,  GOOD !


   A lot of people = GOOD
     more people = BETTER !

   Unleash the cops, I say!

   It's the libertarian thing to do.

   "Cops must be unleashed, and allowed to administer instant punishment,
   subject of course to liability when they are in error. Again: unleash
   the cops to clear the streets of bums and vagrants. Where will they go?
   Who cares?"

   There is no "death by immigration", only death by stupidity.
   Incidentally, that's also how evolution works: the stupid ones are not
   surviving too long...

   I beg to differ. The world is chock full of stupid people - overflowing
   in fact.

   I forget who said this, but it rings true: Stupidity must confer some
   sort of evolutionary advantage or there wouldn't be so much of it.

   Analogies from nature are useful, nonetheless. To me, Sweden looks like
   a bee colony that's been invaded by mites.

   Stupidity has a low survivability rate, partially compensated through a
   higher reproduction rate at the individual level. However, how many
   long lasting stupid societies do you know ?

   In that same vein...

   "We can be dragged before the Court of Justice of the European Union if
   we do not allow people to seek asylum."

   Pray tell, what would be the worst this court could do to Sweden?
   Publish a strongly worded opinion statement?

   Moreover, what is it about gov't workers 'just doing their jobs'?  Is
   this how Third Reich bureaucrats rationalized their existence?

   Q: "How do you personally feel about the camps?"

   No, I'm no freemason. You're a liar, which is quite typical of
   Christians. You've made it a habit now for centuries. Your efforts are
