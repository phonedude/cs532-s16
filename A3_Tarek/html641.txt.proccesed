Does Social Media Matter? (Yes, Because Its Changing)

   Last week -- at an industry event that I helped to organize in Silicon
   Valley -- the great marketing strategist Geoffrey Moore was asked to
   reflect on the impact of one of the most enduring catch phrases in
   business. I'm not talking about "crossing the chasm," the phrase that
   Moore made famous and that is now part of the general business lexicon.
   I'm talking about "IT doesn't matter," the title of a 2003 HBR article
   written by Nicholas Carr. The point the Carr was making then was that
   because IT (information technology) was no longer a differentiator
   because every business had it. At last week's event, blogger/journalist
   [30]Tom Foremski asked if the notion still held true today. Moore
   agreed that we're at a point where innovations in tech again have
   strategic value for the enterprise. We're just at a different point in
   a never-ending cycle. Said Moore: "the goal should be at any given time
   for IT to go from mattering to not mattering."

   What Moore said was on my mind earlier this week when I first got wind
   that one of the original groups supporting [31]social media -- the
   Society for New Communications Research (SNCR) -- was [32]merging with
   The Conference Board, an industry consortium of business leaders that
   is celebrating its first centennial this year.

   Yes -- a one-hundred year old organization is joining with a ten-year
   old organization, and yes, it matters.

   I've got some perspective on this. I was a founding fellow at SNCR, The
   Conference Board is a former client, and I brokered the introduction in
   2014. There are at least three things that make this union noteworthy.
   First, although social media has been adopted by practically every
   business in the Fortune 1000 (the market that The Conference Board
   serves), it is being used strategically -- i.e., as a true
   differentiator -- at far fewer organizations. The integration of SNCR
   research -- and its network of researchers and consultants -- gives
   members of The Conference Board the opportunity to look fresh at
   social, particularly in areas that are not yet common practice.

   Second, one area of practice that will soon find its way into the SNCR
   curriculum could have a profound impact on both marketing and marketing
   professionals: automation technology. There are two competing
   narratives that have emerged: (1) robots (automation) will steal your
   job, or (2) robots will make you a smarter marketer. Because senior
   social professionals have earned the "brand permission" to advise their
   organizations on digital disruption, they are uniquely positioned to
   help lead this important  conversation.

   But what interests me most about the merger has little to do with
   digital disruption, and more with the approach to engagement that
   informed both organizations at their inception. For SNCR -- which is
   known for their industry roundtables -- its about creating intimate
   offline experiences that support professional growth. For The
   Conference Board -- which has been doing industry roundtables since the
   Wilson presidency -- it's the same thing.

   Big difference: The Conference Board has been doing it at scale. In the
   end, the opportunity for The Conference Board and SNCR may be to
   accelerate the net wave of online innovation using the more ancient
   offline tools of community building. That would be a big change indeed,
   [33]and one that I can believe in.
