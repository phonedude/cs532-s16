   Women have rights. They have a right to live in a society that isn't
   completely male dominated. But women are dominated by men all over the
   world. As Malala Yousafzai has said, "I am not a lone voice, I am
   many."

   We need to start by realizing that even in countries like the U.S.,
   women are still oppressed by a male-dominated society. Women make up
   50.8 percent of the U.S. population, but still we are oppressed.
   Society dictates that we must wear the latest fashions and spend
   outrageous amounts of money for things. We are forced to do these
   things, whether or not we realize it, by the men in our families and
   communities.

   Men design the clothes we wear, which many people pay a lot of money
   for because they are the latest. The U.S. has claimed to have made men
   and women equal -- and in many ways we have -- but the fact still
   remains that there are still ways that men dominate the women.

   One in five women will experience sexual assault in their lifetimes in
   the U.S. -- a violent manifestation of the oppression we face.

   Sixty-four percent of women worldwide are illiterate. These women can't
   even read or write a simple sentence such as, "The dog ran." This is
   because women aren't educated. Alarmingly, these women are mostly from
   poor underprivileged areas such as the Middle East and Sub-saharan
   Africa as well as parts of central and South-East Asia.

   Ladies and gentlemen, women are people too. We deserve the same rights
   and education that men do. We deserve to be able to think for
   ourselves, choose what we do for ourselves versus having men tell us
   what to do.

   Friends, I come to you with this to tell you of the social injustice
   that has been carried out against women. Women are oppressed and used
   as "showpieces" for a male-dominated society. I ask you, please help us
   in fighting for the rights of women not just in one place, but in the
   entire world.

   Anneka Rogers is an eighth grader at Menomonie Middle School and
   secretary of the Millroad Rockets 4-H Club.

                [107]Report Abuse
                [108]utleysays - February 17, 2016 9:37 am
                I noticed that this is the second article in the paper
                from an eighth grader from the Menomonie Middle School
                about how women are mistreated. I am thinking maybe a
                teacher has an agenda it is just too ironic. Kids should
                be taught that with hard work they can do anything rather
                than you are all victims. That is one of the biggest
                problems with society now days this generation is
                convinced that they are owed everything somehow because of
                their victimhood.

                I did not see the part at the bottom that she was an
                eighth grader. I hope she does not go through life feeling
                like a victim and actually works hard to achieve her life
                goals. Sports Illustrated? I don't think I have honestly
                looked at one unless at a doctors office just to pass the
                time. The swimsuit issue means nothing to me I guess to
                others its a big deal.

                We need more young people to express their beliefs. I
                congratulate this young person for saying what she
                believes needs to be said.

                Utleysays, the author is an eighth grader?
                But since you bring up advertising and trends, what do you
                think about Sports Illustrated latest swimsuit issue?

                At a loss for words on this one. I guess the answer is
                blame all men for your unhappiness. The very people that
                most liberals want to invite into our country are the
                biggest abusers ever and that will never change because
                they have no intention of assimilating to our culture.
                Their women suffer in silence. Women in this country have
                every right that men do and then some so if they are weak
                enough to fall victim to advertising and Hollywood trends
                who is at fault? What about the women designers? Kind of
                sounds like you want to take the easy way out and blame
                all of women's problems on men. You only are what you make
                of yourself quit blaming others.
