Five places to cross-country ski in central Wisconsin

   Blue Mound State Park - One of the places to cross-country ski in
   central Wisconsin

   [20]In a previous article the author discussed the Kettle Moraine parks
   in southern Wisconsin, which have some of the best cross-country skiing
   in the country in my opinion. Central Wisconsin has a few parks which
   are fantastic as well. They may not be as great as Kettle Moraine, but
   they come close.

   [21]Blue Mound State Park

   Just east of Madison lies this beautiful state park. I have heard it is
   one of the most well maintained cross-country ski destinations in the
   Wisconsin DNR system. The park also does a great job updating the ski
   conditions on their website. The Madison [22]Nordic Ski Club provides
   up to date conditions for the park as well.
   [23]Blue Mound State Park Wisconsin

   Nice hill with gorgeous snow conditions at Blue Mound

   When I skied here there was new snow, but when it stopped snowing it
   started to turn to freezing rain, so the top layer was crusty. Sections
   in the woods were okay, but out in the open the trails were in bad
   condition. The state park was waiting for the freezing rain to stop
   before they groomed it.

   Once we broke through the first layer and skied the trails a second
   time conditions improved. Most of the trails in the park are pretty
   easy, but there is one section along the Ridgeview trail which is
   outstanding. There are at least two difficult technical hills with
   difficult turns.

   [26]Mirror Lake State Park

   I have literally driven past this lake a hundred times going to
   Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. Late last year this was the southern
   terminus of the snow line for a couple of weeks. It was the closest
   place to me with snow, so it was the perfect opportunity to give it a
   try.

   I am glad I did as the park has some great trails. One section twists
   and turns through a ravine and under bridge in a long downhill section.
   The Ishnala Trail is the best and is a 2.2 mile loop that will have you
   doing circles. The Northwest Trail also has some outstanding hills.

   [28]Black River State Forest

   The Black River State Forest is another well maintained ski park in
   central Wisconsin just off the interstate at the Millston exit. Park at
   the Smrekar warming hut and enjoy some fantastic trails through pine
   forest with some impressive hills.

   The difficult trails are unfortunately often closed as they are unable
   to groom them. The intermediate trails will do. There is a pretty
   overlook on the Central Trail. After viewing the surrounding hills and
   forest, the trail descends nicely for a half mile of excitement.

   [31]Governor Dodge State Park

   The last two on the list I have never skied, so I do not have much
   information except to say that Governor Dodge has 12 miles of groomed
   trails and winter camping.

   [32]Devil's Lake State Park

   This is probably the most well known, well visited, and popular state
   park in the Wisconsin State Park system. Most of these visitors flock
   to this beautiful lake in the summer, but skiers enjoy the trails
   during the winter.

   Devil's Lake has 16 miles of groomed trails. I have hiked a portion of
   the park in the summer, and I am sure good trails exist here since the
   park boosts some impressive hills.

   Perhaps those that have can post a quick review in the comment section
   for the last two on the list.

   All of these parks are part of the wonderful Wisconsin State Park
   system. There is a fee system to enjoy all of these parks. For more
   information on the fees click [34]here.

    1. [51]A post Birkebeiner cool down ski in the Black River State
       Forest | Wisconsin Outside.com - December 8, 2011
       [...] Two years ago, I skied my first American Birkebeiner and
       finished in just under 6 hours. You would have thought six hours of
       skiing on a weekend would get the activity out of my system. I
       drove home the next day and passed through Millston, Wisconsin
       close to sunset. I got a room close by and skied for a couple of
       hours in the Black River State Forest. [...]
