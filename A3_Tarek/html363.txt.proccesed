   [22]5 Top Social Media Dashboard Tools to Manage Your Social Accounts

   Let's face it. Social media marketing is hard work. Sometimes you feel
   like a one legged man in a kickboxing competition.

   Over the last few years it has become an integral part of your business
   and marketing.

   You use social media to source leads, keep in touch with your old
   clients and even serve your current customers.

   The only problem?

   The Internet never sleeps.

   But you can't be online 24/7.

   On top of it, there are multiple social media platforms fighting for
   your attention at any give time.  (I can think of at least ten from the
   top off my head!)

   If you're a blogger or a small business, you cannot imagine hiring
   dedicated staff for social media management. Even if you can afford it,
   you may still not want to.

   Where 40% of small business owners are most likely to outsource
   TV/radio ads and 35% are likely to do the same with SEO [23]only a
   measly 5% want to outsource social media marketing and email
   newsletters.

   So how on earth are  you supposed to manage staying on top of things;
   interact and engage with your followers while scheduling all those
   posts on each of these accounts?

   Before you decide to go on a digital sabbatical, here's some good news.

   Enter social media dashboards.

   If you're an avid social media marketer, you've probably heard of a
   social media dashboard before. These online tools help you combat the
   time-sucking vortex that social media can sometimes be.

What is a social media dashboard?

   Simply put, a social media dashboard makes social media management
   super-easy. It syncs all your social media accounts in one convenient
   place.

   In its truest sense, a dashboard also allows you to see all your social
   media analytics at one place, thus eliminating the need to manually go
   into each account and check what happened in the past week.

   A robust dashboard will let you connect with all major social media
   platforms out there. At the bareminimum, most good tools will sync
   Facebook, Twitter, Google + and LinkedIn.

5 benefits of using a social media dashboard

1. Productivity

   Let's be honest. How many times have you logged in on Facebook to
   schedule posts on your business page only to find yourself lost in the
   sea of posts after 30 minutes? And suddenly, you realise you haven't
   retweeted something you were meaning to. You rush to Twitter and the
   same story repeats. A dashboard will save you ton of time. Because on
   its own, each social media platform can be a time-suck. With a
   dashboard, you are keeping things in perspective.

2. Tracking

   You want to keep a tab on what your competitors are upto. Who's talking
   about them? Who's following them? How's their engagement? All
   tracking-related questions that you can answer with simple search
   inside the tool.

3. Scheduling

   Only a few social networks allow you to schedule your content. It's a
   headache to go inside each account and schedule every post manually.
   Granted, networks like Twitter operate in "real-time" but you can't be
   online all day long. Plus, no one likes being bombarded with string of
   posts within a given span of time, so scheduling is a smarter way to be
   present without really being there. A dashboard comes to rescue!

4. Analytics

   You've probably wondered: What type of posts are a "hit" with my
   audience? Which ones get the most shares and engagement? How do I get
   more leads through social channels? Thankfully, with a dashboard, you
   can stop the guesswork. By seeing what your audience clicked on, you
   can fine-tune into what your followers enjoy. Dashboards make it easy
   to analyze everything at once.

5. Collaboration

   Most dashboard tools will allow you and your team members to
   collaborate. You can also divide roles and duties and allocate social
   media tasks to each member so you know who's accountable. Works like a
   charm especially when you're remotely-based.

   With that, let's look at the pros and cons of five popular social media
   dashboard tools.

5 social media dashboard tools

   Here are 5 top dashboard tools that can help you manage your social
   media marketing.

1. [24]Cyfe

   Cyfe is a full-blown business analytics tool that connects all your
   online activities, not just social media.

   Signing up with their Forever Free plan is easy. Just enter your name,
   email and password and you're all set.

   The tool has a myriad of widgets for different purposes, such as:
     * Advertising
     * Blogging
     * Email
     * Monitoring
     * Sales and Finance
     * SEO
     * Social Media
     * Web analytics

   Each widget supports many different services that you can sync. For
   example, the Sales and Finance widget lets you add Freshbooks, Paypal,
   Xero, Salesforce etc.

   The Social Media widget allows you to add different profiles as shown
   below:

   [25]5 Social Media Dashboard Tools

   You can also add a Competitor Dashboard in Cyfe where you can monitor
   their SEO and social media growth using widgets.

   Cyfe is not just limited to social media - think of it as an integrated
   dashboard.

   For example, if you use multiple Gmail inboxes - one for personal
   emails, another for client work and still another for guest blogging -
   keeping a tab on each one could be a pain. In Cyfe, you can easily
   create a Gmail dashboard for ease of management and boost your
   productivity.

   Of course, not everyone needs all these features, so you can only use
   what applies to you. When compared to other tools out there, you'll
   notice Cyfe comes in free and premium plans that aren't all that
   expensive.

   Pricing: Forever free plan.

   $19/mo for unlimited everything (includes unlimited team members,
   dashboards and widgets) or $14/mo if paid annually.

2. [26]Hootsuite

   Hoosuite is one of the more popular tools out there that has grown to
   over 6 million users. The dashboard is available in 13 languages.

   You can create a new account for free or sign in using your Facebook,
   Twitter or Google account.

   [27]5 Social Media Dashboard Tools to Help You Manage Your Social
   Accounts Better

   Once you sync your networks within Hootsuite, you can add "streams" in
   the form of columns.

   Streams can be Sent tweets, Retweets, Mentions, Home, Wall Posts etc. A
   stream is nothing but your activity on a social network.

   You can also add tabs to group streams under relevant columns so you
   can keep streams from different social media separate.

   So your tabs can be for Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, with each
   containing streams from the respective platform.

   Hootsuite also makes scheduling super simple.

   There is also an app directory, a library of third-party free and
   premium apps that you can use.

   At this time, Hootsuite allows the following social networks to be
   added (for more, you'll have to try their third-party apps):
     * Twitter
     * Facebook
     * Google+
     * LinkedIn
     * Foursquare
     * WordPress
     * Mixi

   Pricing: Free for up to three social profiles with no collaboration.

   From $9.99/mo for 50 profiles and +1 team members. Larger plans also
   available.

3. [28]Sendible

   Sendible can schedule future social network posts and bring all your
   social media interaction under one roof along with emails and SMS
   marketing integration (CRM).

   They also include brand monitoring for Yelp which could be useful for
   local businesses.

    [29] 5 Social Media Dashboard Tools to Help You Manage Your Social
   Accounts Better

   Inside though, it looks more like using an email client than a
   dashboard.

   You can compose and publish blog posts to WordPress, Tumblr and
   Blogspot also.

   You can do a 30-day free trial because Sendible doesn't provide you
   with any free accounts after the period lapses. So you have to provide
   your credit card details although you can cancel, upgrade or downgrade
   anytime.

   Pricing: $39.99/mo for their Start up plan that includes up to 40
   services, two team members and two branded reports. Larger plans also
   available.

4. [30]Sprout Social

   I've never used Social Sprout before, but I've been hearing about it
   recently. So I decided to give it a try.

   Signing up with Social Sprout is a breeze. And they don't ask you for
   any credit card details either. On the flip side, the free trial is
   limited to 30 days.

   Personally I don't like the fact that once you sign up, you're asked to
   attach with your Twitter account. Without authorizing, you can't
   proceed.

   Social Sprout asks for my business name and timezone upfront. Timezones
   can be tricky especially when dealing with social media, so I like how
   it is taken care of in the beginning.

   Then, I am asked to do one of three things: Add social profiles, invite
   my team or jump into my inbox.

   Sprout Social allows you to sync your Twitter, Facebook, Google+,
   LinkedIn and Feedly accounts.

   [31]5 Social Media Dashboard Tools to Help You Manage Your Social
   Accounts Better

   Unlike Hootsuite, Sprout Social doesn't use columns.

   Another neat feature is easy setup for brand keywords (for social media
   monitoring). When you set up these keywords for your brand name, you'll
   receive inbox messages from Twitter and Facebook even when someone
   mentions you without the @ tag.

   Once you link your Twitter, you can search for people who follow you
   but you're not following them under their Discover tab or "Clean up"
   any silent, irregular or "do not follow back" accounts. Cool!

   The down side is it's on the expensive end and allows for limited
   number of profiles that you can connect even with a paid plan.

   Pricing: Starts at $59/mo for an individual plan for up to 10 profiles.
   Larger plans also available.

5. [32]Buffer

   If you don't want any fancy features, are starting out or like to keep
   it simple, try [33]Buffer. Signing up is pretty simple. They give you
   four options to login - Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or email.

   The interface is delightfully clean with lots of whitespace that's easy
   on the eyes. The free trial account can sync major social platforms
   like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+.

   Once you sync an account, Buffer gives you four main tabs as below:

   [34]5 Social Media Dashboard Tools to Help You Manage Your Social
   Accounts Better

   I love their "Suggestions" tab that has a list of posts I might like to
   share with my followers in categories of marketing, inspiration,
   lifehack etc.

   Another plus is I don't have to attach my personal profiles - I can
   choose to attach a Group on Facebook or a Page on LinkedIn, for
   example.

   Pricing: $10/mo or $102/yr.

   Business plans starting at $50/mo for 25 accounts, 5 team members and
   15 RSS feeds pulled into your profile. Check their website for larget
   business plans.

   When it comes to social media tools, there is no right or wrong pick,
   only what is right for you.
     * Are you going to use the dashboard only for social media or
       something more than that?
     * Do you have a team that will be posting?
     * Is the number of profiles connected important to you?
     * Perhaps you have a budget of less than $25/mo?

   Such criteria will help you make a choice and eliminate anything that's
   not a fit. J

   Each of the above tools has a different look and feel, features and
   pricing. Choosing the right type depends on your business needs.

   Your turn! Is social media slowly becoming a time-suck for you? Are you
   staying on top of things? If not, give one of the above tools a try and
   let us know how you go!

       We use Hootsuite and Sendible, but I'd also add MarketMeSuite
       ([47]http://marketmesuite.com) - which has a nice location search
       feature where you can search for Tweets mentioning specific
       keywords within a radius of 1 mile up to 1000 miles. [Disclaimer -
       I'm an advisor to them].

       We would like to add another alternative. From our perspective,
       most tools are easy to use for people who live the internet. For
       people who run a business and do marketing on top, most of them are
       still to complex. Thats why we developed a Tool, that helps to
       update your WordPress based website as well as Facebook and
       Twitter.
       Its currently productive in German, but English Version starts very
       soon!
