Twitter, to Save Itself, Must Scale Back World-Swallowing Ambitions

   [18]Twitter is the world‚s most important social network.

     *
     *
     *
     *

   That might sound like the ravings of [19]an addict, but look at the
   headlines in every morning‚s newspaper and the obsessions of every
   evening‚s cable news broadcast. Just about anything you encounter in
   the news media these days has some foot in the controversies and
   conversations occurring on the 140-character network.

   Yet for all its influence, Twitter, as a company, is in trouble. Big
   trouble. The network has always been [20]too strange and too difficult
   for new users to get the hang of, and its growth has been slowing for a
   while. Now, according to an earnings report released on Wednesday, user
   growth [21]has ground to a halt.

   Tech investors have not been in a forgiving mood lately for any
   company, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter‚s co-founder and [22]recently
   reinstated chief executive, is unlikely to enjoy much grace.

   So what‚s to be done? It‚s time for Twitter to consider something
   radical. More than two years ago, the company [24]floated its shares on
   the New York Stock Exchange. On its first day of trading, investors
   valued Twitter at nearly $32 billion, a price that established a
   certain set of expectations: that Twitter would keep altering its
   service to attract mainstream users, and that its ad business would
   continue to grow at a breakneck pace.

   Wall Street has only one template of success for an Internet company:
   Google and, later, Facebook. By filing for an initial public offering,
   Twitter was telling the world that it was part of the same club ‚ that
   there was no upper bound to its business aims, and that it would try to
   build a money machine that matched the size and importance of its
   service.

   But what if the best path for Twitter, as a service, is for Twitter the
   company to abandon that dream? What if becoming a $25 billion, $50
   billion or $100 billion world-swallowing Internet giant just isn‚t in
   the cards for a niche service like Twitter?

   Perhaps there‚s more promise in a future as an independent but private
   company; as a small and sustainable division of some larger tech or
   media conglomerate; or even as a venture that operates more like a
   nonprofit foundation.

   Even if Twitter intends to remain a public corporation ‚ because there
   does not seem to be much appetite, nor a very obvious mechanism, for
   investors to take it private ‚ it‚s time for Mr. Dorsey to reset
   expectations for what his company can become. Twitter should think of
   itself and portray itself to investors as more of a public utility than
   as a business that never stops growing, and that could ever hope to
   approach the market value of Facebook.

   ‚Maybe Twitter is not meant to be the most popular band in the world,‚
   said Anil Dash, a longtime user of Twitter and the chief executive of
   [33]ThinkUp, a start-up that intends [34]to improve how people use
   social networks. ‚Maybe it‚s meant to be merely Pearl Jam and not U2,
   and maybe Twitter could find equilibrium as a company with an
   enterprise value of merely $5 billion.‚ (At the moment, the market
   values Twitter at about $10 billion.)

   This does not mean that Twitter should abandon making money. Twitter
   can still run a fine business that generates enough to maintain and
   improve the reach of the service. But every Internet company doesn‚t
   have to be the biggest, boldest, always-growing entity we are
   conditioned to expect.

   Instead of aiming for something like Facebook, Twitter could mold
   itself on some other template for success. It could become a venture
   like Wikipedia, run by a nonprofit that depends on donations, or a
   business like The New York Times Company, a publicly traded enterprise
   controlled by a family that has a preference for journalistic ambition.

   In other words, Twitter should make clear that there are limits to the
   scope of its business ambitions, and that it is guided by a
   philosophical bias for the health of the service over an ambition to
   grow at any cost.

   There‚s a simple reason for Mr. Dorsey to consider some other path:
   Implausible expectations are a setup for a bleak future. After losing
   its dominance as a search engine, Yahoo has faced more than a decade of
   struggle mainly because it has tried too long to become the one-stop
   portal that it isn‚t.

   In that effort it has squandered talent and money and run through more
   chief executives than you‚d find at a Brooks Brothers sale. If, instead
   of pursuing the moon, Yahoo had vastly lowered its ambitions and
   planned to do one or two things really well, it could have found a
   sustainable path forward.

   Clarifying Twitter‚s mission would be painful for the people who work
   at the company. There could be more layoffs and a plummeting of the
   equity they hold in the company if it were to go private. It would also
   be painful for investors who bought in to the company expecting it to
   be the next big thing.

   But limiting Twitter‚s scope would almost certainly be better for the
   service. Twitter needs to improve its product: It should have better
   ways of addressing abuse and harassment, and it should be easier for
   users to find tweets about topics that interest them. But it isn‚t
   clear that the solutions to these problems are found in growth.

   Mr. Dash pointed out that making Twitter easier for new people to join
   could in fact worsen the problems of harassment. ‚The discussion is
   always about reducing friction to joining,‚ he said. ‚But one of the
   things that might drive better behavior might be to increase friction ‚
   to make it harder to sign up. But nobody‚s having that discussion.‚

   Setting a cap on Twitter‚s business scope could also tame some of the
   overreactions that occur whenever the company tries to make reasonable
   improvements to its service.

   This week, in anticipation of what turned out to be a modest feature
   that recommends interesting tweets to people, thousands of users on the
   service lost their minds predicting that Twitter as we know it was soon
   to be dead.

   I suspect they are leery because they see a company being pushed to
   change by Wall Street, for reasons that aren‚t exactly obvious to the
   people who now love and value Twitter as it is. They see their favorite
   band straining to become U2. And they hate U2.

   Twitter, as it is right now, is mostly pretty good for lots and lots of
   people. Facebook has five times as many users, Instagram is as
   luxurious as a European vacation, and Snapchat is too cool for school.
   But because Twitter is an accessible, real-time network that has become
   the nerve center of the world‚s journalists, politicians, activists and
   agitants, it has, for better or worse, demonstrated an unrivaled
   capacity to influence real things in the real world.

   Consider the Arab Spring, [38]#blacklivesmatter or ‚Make America Great
   Again.‚

   ‚Twitter has created space for the amplification of the voice of
   marginalized people in ways that we have not seen before,‚ said DeRay
   McKesson, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. ‚It
   has redefined our understanding of the public sphere to be more
   inclusive and more accessible and to have substantive impact on
   real-world events.‚

   But even beyond these movements, look at all those hashtags littering
   every Super Bowl ad. Or more simply, look at the thrum of
   minute-by-minute Twitter commentary that now [39]shapes how any news
   event or TV show is received. If people don‚t tweet it, did it even
   happen?

   Of course, Twitter could be better. But it does not need a wholesale
   overhaul just for the sake of fueling growth.

   ‚Twitter maybe hasn‚t evolved the product to the point that Wall Street
   analysts might like, but the utility that Twitter has for providing
   real-time news is real, and it hasn‚t really been disrupted by anyone
   else,‚ said Mike Jones, the chief executive of a start-up incubator
   named Science Media.

   Mr. Jones used to be the chief executive of Myspace, the once-giant
   social network, but he rejected any comparison between Twitter and that
   now vastly diminished network.

   ‚For me and for lots of people, Twitter has actual utility to it, and
   for those people, that‚s what will keep it around,‚ he said.
