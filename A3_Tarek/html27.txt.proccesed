The Benefits of Becoming an Empty Nester

   February 3, 2016

   The Benefits of Becoming an Empty Nester (1) The day we decide to have
   babies and raise a family we savor every moment because we know one day
   they'll grow up and move out of the house.

   I used to dread that day too. Just thinking about it would make me sad
   and the water works would start.

   But as my kids grew up, who are now a teen and young adults, the hubs
   and I have a lot more time to spend with each other, now that the kids
   are doing their own thing. I started to think, if it's good now, can
   you imagine how much fun we're going to have when they're all out of
   the house?

   I changed with my mindset at becoming an empty nester. Instead of
   thinking how quiet and empty the house will be, I soon realized isn't
   going to be such a bad thing after all. In fact, it's like a new
   chapter in my life and for the hubs.

   Instead of being sad at the thought about the kids moving out of the
   house, think of the things you can do with your sweetie pie when you
   become an empty nester.

   Here are some examples of what you can do.

Turn an Extra Bedroom into Your Dream Room

   With the kids out of the house now you can turn the extra bedroom into
   your own dream room. Have you ever wanted a workout room, a library or
   even a gift wrapping room? How about the hubs? Has he ever mentioned
   turning the extra room into a man cave?

   The possibilities are endless and the only tough decision to make is
   which one will get the room of their dreams, hehe.

The Cost of Living is Not as Expensive

   This is one thing I'm looking forward to. Right now I spend about $200
   a week on groceries and that's just four us, although my 22-year-old is
   about 6'4" and eats like a linebacker! My parents are empty nesters and
   my dad says their grocery bill is less than $100 a week and most of the
   time they dine out. I can't wait for the day I no longer have to cook!

Travel More

   When the kids were little we took a road trip to San Antonio, Texas. We
   could survive a three-hour drive, right? Wrong! The kids were tired;
   they were bored and were hungry. We had to make frequent pit stops so
   they can go potty, ugh. And the complaining, I've never heard such
   noise...and that was the hubs, lol!

   Now that it's you and your spouse, you can take the vacations you've
   dreamed about. Number one, the cost is less than a family vacation. And
   second, it's a time to [35]connect with your sweetie.

Speaking of Connecting With Your Sweetie

   The time alone at home is a great chance to get reacquainted with your
   significant other without the distractions of kids and crazy schedules.
   You can actually have adult conversations and even a little afternoon
   delight if they so please!

Time to Focus on You

   Now that the kids are out of the house you can focus on you. Take on a
   hobby, attend a class, do some volunteer work. The possibilities are
   endless!

   So while you're going down memory lane and reminiscing about the time
   when your kiddos were little, think about the new and exciting journey
   you're about to embark on with your spouse or significant other!

How about you?

       OMG Cori. My kids are still with me, grown kids and grandchildren.
       I'm looking forward to an empty nest at some point in time although
       it does make me sad. I'm waiting for all the wonderful time I can
       have but at the same time I know I'll be lonely but I'll adjust. I
       love all the reasons you mentioned that I never thought of before.
       Thanks for the inspiration.

       Hi Cori,
       I'm still have a bunch of years to go before I'm an empty nester.
       Now, when I tell my son that one day he'll live at college he still
       asks, "Why? I want to live with you forever." Thanks for this post
       to help me imagine the next phase with my kiddos - when they're
       living on their own!
       Best,
       Alli

       I looked forward to it in a way, but I always wanted to add a girl
       to my boys.... so I kept trying.... and ended with a huge age gap,
       and I'm not sure we will ever reach the empty nester stage. My
       oldest is on his own. Own place and all, middle is in college and I
       have his room for my dream area. Youngest is 7 and I love him
       dearly.... and yes it's 3 boys for me. My hubby is almost 60 and
       I'm almost 50, so instead we are facing a different reality than
       originally we planned, but it's not bad, just different. One day we
       will be home alone hopefully after my youngest heads off to school
       or where he wants, and will hopefully still have the mobility to do
       the things we wanted, but until then - we will enjoy what we
       have....

       I am looking forward to traveling more and taking up more hobbies
       and crafts. I think I will also get more into volunteering and
       helping others. Giving my time is something I look forward too when
       the kids get older

            Hi Kita,
            Volunteering and helping others is in my plans too. I'm going
            to be the little old lady who hangs out at church all day :).
            The good part about the kids getting older is they can help
            out with volunteering too. My sons have helped out at church
            as well and I couldn't be more proud. :)
            Thank you for coming by to read my post and for your comment.
            You're in my thoughts and prayers.

       I'm almost there - my eldest 3 - my son (25) left home at 16; my
       daughter (21) left home at 18; and my son (18) is about to leave
       home in September to go to university. That leaves 2 sons who are
       10 & 9 to go! Looking forward to going away at weekends with my
       husband .... and being spontaneous!

            grandsons are hanging out with us and we go out on dates with
            them. I don't mind it though.

       Two of mine have left the nest, one flew 3000k to the other side of
       Australia, the other lives in the city adjoining mine. It was hard
       when they first left but they are happy and doing jobs they enjoy.
       My youngest, age 25, has an intellectual disability and will always
       be with us. When he was young I worried that I would never
       experience the freedom of the empty nest. Now I'm really pleased
       that I don't have to - I kinda got used to having him around :-)

            Hi Sue,
            My daughter moved a couple hours away to attend school but the
            night she had a car accident it felt like she was thousands of
            miles away because we couldn't get to her that night but I was
            there by 7am tne next day to pick her up.
            I'm not quite the empty nester yet but my sons are grown. One
            is saving money to move out - although he has no timeline and
            my other son has epilepsy. I thought he would be the one to
            stay with us forever but the meds he's on are helping him and
            he told me as soon as he's cleared by the doctor to work and
            drive he's going to save money and move to Colorado. Go
            figure. :)
            I've gotten used to having them around too...It's going to be
            hard when they move but I know they have a life to live and
            can't be a mama's boy forever, I wish though. :)
            Thanks for reading my post and for leaving a comment. Hope
            you're having a great week!

       Hi Cori,
       When I became an empty nester, I wanted to do cart wheels down the
       street. Maybe it is because I was a single mom and mothering was a
       24/7 eagle eye job. Sure I missed her but I sure was ready to
       embark on a new journey.
       Reconnecting to my sweetie was the best. And also eating dinner
       when I wanted was another perk.

            Hi Donna,
            LOL...I can just imagine you doing cart wheels! :)
            My boys or guys aren't quite ready to move out but they're
            doing their own thing so that gives me and the hubs a chance
            to hang out and reconnect. I love that we can go to a concert
            or get away for the weekend and not worry about a sitter. When
            they were little we hardly went out as a couple so now this is
            our time. :)
            Oh yes, I love that I don't have to cook as much and the house
            stays clean...until the grandsons come over, lol.
            Thanks for reading my post and for your comment. Here's to
            empty nesters!
            Happy Thursday!

       I am halfway there, one in college and one starting high school
       this year. Things have chabce now as they now can do whatever they
       want, they chose their friends over family. So it's just my husband
       and I most of the time. Unfortunately, we are not financially able
       to go traveling and I do worry what it would be like once both kids
       are gone and in their own.

            Hi Maria,
            I still have two at home but hey're grown so like you, it's
            just me and the hubs most of the time.
            We aren't in the position to travel either, our daughter's
            tuition is going to cost us an arm and a leg but we love
            getting away for the weekend. We live 45 minutes away from
            Galveston, TX so we're close enough to get home in case of an
            emergency and far enough to have some alone time. :)
            Thanks for coming by to read my post and for your comment.
            Have a great day!

       Hey Cori!
       I can imagine how one's life would be turned upside down a bit from
       having children around to having none. Kinda like getting your
       second honeymoon, right? I'm sure some would use the extra
       bedroom(s) for something else but then there are those who would
       keep the room(s) as they were for when the kids came home.
       It's something I'll never be able to experience but I'll live
       through your experience. Thanks for sharing this with us!

            Hey Bren,
            I does kind of feel like a second honeymoon. We're having a
            great time hanging out. We can take off whenever we'd like -
            that's when the hubs isn't working, lol.
            We turned the extra bedroom into the grandsons room but Marisa
            still has stuff in there too. She doesn't know it yet, but
            she's sharing it with them. :)
            Thanks for having me gf!
