Why Good Logo is Essential for you Business

   Why Good Logo is Essential for you Business

   Hello, I hope you are doing well. In some last articles, all we talked
   about ideas. If you have not gone through that, Please make an effort
   to read [21]How to Know If Your Idea Works? Until you don't have a good
   idea, even a good looking and professional logo can't help you. First
   thing to worry about is idea, then comes a good looking logo. When i
   say "A Good Logo", I think about Apple. They had spent almost half of
   their first income on designing a perfect logo.

What does a Good logo say?

   Logos are a critical aspect of business marketing. As the company's
   major graphical representation, a logo anchors a company's brand and
   becomes the single most visible manifestation of the company within the
   target market. For this reason, a well-designed logo is an essential
   part of any company's overall marketing strategy.

   A good logo appears on all of the company letterhead, communications,
   marketing and advertising pieces of a business as a graphic
   representation or symbol for the company. Essentially, the logo is
   typically the first thing a reader may notice before reading the text.
   Logos help in the creation of a brand identity for a company or
   business because the primary functions of a logo are to inspire trust,
   recognition and admiration for a business or product. A logo must be
   simple, memorable, timeless, appropriate and versatile, but at the same
   time conjure up the feeling you want your target audience to associate
   with your business.

   Purpose

   Corporate logos are intended to be the "face" of a company: They are
   graphical displays of a company's unique identity, and through colors
   and fonts and images they provide essential information about a company
   that allows customers to identify with the company's core brand. Logos
   are also a shorthand way of referring to the company in advertising and
   marketing materials; they also provide an anchor point for the various
   fonts, colors and design choices in all other business marketing
   materials.

   Design Principles

   Good logos should be unique and comprehensible to potential customers.
   Although there are myriad choices for color, visual elements and
   typography, in general a logo should help convey some information about
   the company, or be designed in a way that gives some sense of meaning
   about the company or its industry. For example, cutting-edge firms and
   tech companies tend to have angular logos to convey speed, while
   service-oriented firms have rounded logos to provide a sense of service
   and trust.

   Brand Identity

   Logos are the chief visual component of a company's overall brand
   identity. The logo appears on stationery, websites, business cards and
   advertising. For that reason, a well-designed logo can contribute to
   business success, while a substandard logo can imply amateurishness and
   turn off potential customers. However, a logo should cohere well with
   other aspects of a company's visual presentation: No logo, however well
   designed, can look good when surrounded by contradictory graphical
   elements or inconsistent fonts. This is why a logo is the basic unit of
   a larger brand identity that includes company fonts, colors and
   document-design guidelines.

   Return on Investment

   As consumers grow to know, like and trust a specific brand, they are
   more likely to respond positively to successive encounters with a
   logo-potentially leading to increased sales or improved mind share
   within the target market. In addition, a well-designed logo implies a
   degree of professionalism and competence that could help steer
   potential new clients toward selecting the business rather than a
   competitor with no or substandard logos.

   Common Mistakes

   Small businesses often play it fast-and-loose with logos, paying
   insufficient attention to their proper size and positioning and
   surrounding them with materials-including [23]clipart-that compete with
   them visually. Avoid re-creating different types of logos for specific
   purposes (e.g., letterhead and business cards) or having
   similar-but-not-identical versions for print and online purposes.
