Sucuri CloudProxy

   CloudProxy is the WebSite Firewall from [7]Sucuri. It stands between
   your site and the rest of the world and protects against attacks,
   malware infections, DDOS, brute force attempts and mostly anything that
   can harm it.

   Not only that, but your sites get cached, speeding it up quite a bit.
