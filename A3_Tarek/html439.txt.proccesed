   Focus for the NBA's All-Star Weekend tends to fall on three events: the
   All-Star Game, the dunk contest, and the three point contest. There's
   also the celebrity game, and the Rising Stars game, and the D-League
   All-Star game, which are fine if ultimately easy to skip and catch
   highlights of after the fact should anything interesting happen. But
   the most disappointing event the NBA will put on this weekend is the
   Taco Bell Skills Challenge.

   I don't have anything against dribbling, passing, layups, or shooting.
   These are all important basketball skills that I in no way posses.
   (That's not entirely true; I'll be the give to your go in a pinch.)

   But: these are not TACO BELL SKILLS. A true Taco Bell Skills Challenge
   would consist of the following events.

   1. Car Scarf. Participants are given one bean burrito, two soft tacos,
   and a Mexican pizza. They must eat all four items while driving two
   miles around a closed road course as quickly as they can.

   2. The Jackson Stretch. Each participant is handed $20 and instructed
   to go to Taco Bell to order food for drunk Charles Barkley, drunk Jeff
   Van Gundy, and sober Shaq without being given any instructions as to
   what these three would like. They are then judged by this panel on
   economic efficiency, order variety, and satisfaction level delivered.

   3. Packet Hunter. The participants have thirty seconds to locate as
   many hidden packets of Fire Sauce stashed throughout a 24 year old's
   Toyota Camry. Possible hiding places include the cup holders, glove
   compartment, floor, pockets behind the front seats, in that space where
   the seat belt fastener is, and somehow stuffed inside the airbag.

   4. Chalupautopsy. One Taco Bell menu item is selected at random (sides
   and desserts excluded) and smashed into bits. The contestants have
   three guesses to determine which item they're eating.

   5. Table Challenge. Contestants must see how long they can go minding
   their business and eating in the dining room of a college town Taco
   Bell at 2 in the morning without inadvertently getting drawn into a
   brawl.
