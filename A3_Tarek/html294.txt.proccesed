[38]Ernst-Backed Bill to Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Passes
Committee

Legislation awaits full Senate consideration

Feb 10 2016

   WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today the [39]Senate Homeland Security &
   Governmental Affairs Committee passed the Combat Terrorist Use of
   Social Media Act of 2016 (S. 2517). U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), an
   original co-sponsor along with Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), highlighted
   the critical importance of the legislation introduced by Senator Ron
   Johnson (R-WI).

   "I want to thank both Chairman Johnson and Senator Booker for working
   with me on this bill. This will require the Obama Administration to
   fulfill a promise that they made back in 2011 to develop a
   comprehensive strategy to counter and prevent violent extremism and
   online radicalization," Senator Ernst stated. "So while President Obama
   continues to lack a comprehensive overall strategy to defeat ISIS, this
   legislation will ensure he must at least present a strategy to address
   its use of social media to spread terror."

   In December 2011, the Obama Administration released a [42]"Strategic
   Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent
   Extremism in the United States" which made the following commitment:
   "[b]ecause of the importance of the digital environment, we will
   develop a separate, more comprehensive strategy for countering and
   preventing violent extremist online radicalization and leveraging
   technology to empower community resilience that considers: (1) the
   latest assessment of the role of the Internet; (2) the absence of clear
   national boundaries in online space and the relationship between
   international and domestic radicalization to violence; (3) relevant
   legal issues; and (4) the differing authorities and capabilities of
   departments and agencies."

   The Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act requires the president to
   prepare:
     * A report on terrorists' and terrorist organizations' use of social
       media and an evaluation of current government efforts to combat
       such use.
     * A comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists' and terrorist
       organizations' use of social media.

   The bipartisan legislation is the companion to H.R. 3654, introduced by
   Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) along with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman
   Ed Royce (R-CA) and Ranking Member Eliot Engel (D-NY), and passed by
   the House in December 2015.
