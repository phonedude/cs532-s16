How to Use Hootsuite for Social Listening

   Mike Allton is an Internet Marketing Consultant and
   certified [36]HootSuite Solution Partner. This article, on how to
   schedule social media posts, is the fourth in a series on making the
   most of your HootSuite account and was originally published on The
   Social Media Hat. View the original [37]here.

What is Social Listening?

   Mike Allton Mike Allton

   Of course, it helps if we're all on the same page as to what [38]Social
   Listening means. The details will vary from business to business and
   industry to industry, but the core principle is that brands will listen
   to conversations taking place on social media and look for
   opportunities to participate and engage customers and prospects.

   First, a business will identify specific words and phrases that might
   be part of a conversation that would apply to the business. For
   instance, if your business solves specific problems, you would listen
   for people talking about those kinds of issues. You might find
   opportunities to provide assistance or resources, or to reach out to
   individuals in need.

   Second, a business will identify key influencers. These are people who
   may be well-known in the industry, or perhaps in roles where a referral
   could go a long way. For instance, gaining the interest and support of
   someone more established on Twitter, where they may have a much larger
   following, might result in getting a retweet or mention that helps
   extend the reach and visibility of your business tremendously.

Conversational Listening with Hootsuite

   To [39]begin listening for key conversations, follow these steps:

   1. Identify specific terms to listen for. Do some test searches and
   refine the terms as needed in order to achieve the kinds of results
   you're looking for.

   2. [40]Create a new Stream for each Term or Phrase. I recommend having
   a specific Tab set up for Conversations and then you can have up to ten
   streams within that Tab. Each stream can be a specific term or phrase,
   and can be set up to search Twitter or Google+ (you can search
   Facebook and LinkedIn as well, but only conversations from your
   existing connections, whereas the other platforms will search all
   Public posts).

   - You can use the Quick Search in the upper right corner of your
   HootSuite Dashboard to look for terms and phrases that might work for
   you. Once you find one, click on the Save as Stream button and it will
   be added as a stream within your existing tab.
   - You can click on the Add Stream button and select a network, then
   select Search, and type in the phrase you want to search on.

   3. Check your Conversations tab at least once a day to see what status
   updates have been posted that match those search terms, and respond if
   appropriate.

   I have [41]mentioned before that you can have canned responses set up
   as templates. Simply open the Compose box, type in your message, and
   click on the disk icon to save it as a template. You can then call that
   up whenever needed. This is particularly useful when social listening
   as you will often be providing the same basic answer and resources.
   Just make sure to edit your message before sending to customize it for
   the specific situation and individual.

   You can also [42]send tweets or updates that you find in your search to
   other Team members. We're going to get into Teams in more detail in
   another article, but the idea here is that larger businesses may have
   multiple people involved, and certain people may be better suited to
   respond to specific inquiries. An example I've given before is that of
   a law office, where an office manager may be responsible for all
   initial social media monitoring and listening, but any serious
   enquiries or opportunities would be forwarded to one of the attorneys
   in the office for a more professional response.

   Assign a Message Gif

   If your business is restricted to a specific geographic area, say, only
   the Greater St. Louis Area, then you have the option of
   [43]geo-locating your search results and only seeing messages posted by
   people within your area. This will obviously filter out updates from
   people whom you're not interested in targeting as a potential customer.

   Yet another reason for using Conversational Listening is for
   [44]Customer Service. You can set up search streams for instances of
   where people are talking about you and your company, either directly or
   indirectly, and engage those customers in whatever way is appropriate.
   A simple is example would be if someone decided to complain about your
   brand on Twitter. Unless they happened to mention your Twitter handle,
   you'd have no idea that they said anything about you. If you're
   listening though, you can at least give yourself an opportunity to
   respond and try to make the situation better.

   Brands can also use listening as a means to monitor competitors. By
   setting up search streams, lists and circles, you can keep an eye on
   what your competition is doing and make sure that you're positioned to
   respond to any sudden sales or other developments which might affect
   your own business or customers.

   Keep in mind that you can have up to 50 tabs set up within your
   HootSuite Dashboard, and each tab can have up to 10 streams saved, so
   you can create whatever tab and stream combinations you need. Every
   time you log into your HootSuite account and select one of these tabs,
   all of the saved streams will update. And you can add or delete streams
   whenever needed, so don't be shy about creating temporary streams that
   you might only use for a week or even a day, then delete later. When
   I'm doing any kind of research into social media activity and
   conversations, I will save the streams so I can keep referring back to
   them for as long as I need them. You can do the same thing when
   researching customers, discussion topics, other brands and so on.

Influencer Listening with Hootsuite

   As we mentioned earlier, it's important for every business to begin to
   identify key influencers and thought leaders in their industry. By
   doing so, you:
    1. Follow them and gain insight into your own business and industry as
       a result of reading what they say and share.
    2. Create opportunities for you to share and retweet these key
       thoughts and links to your own followers, creating value.
    3. By sharing and retweeting, and actively participating in the online
       conversations happening around these updates and individuals, you
       begin to link yourself with those individuals.
    4. The more you engage with and show an interest in these influencers,
       the more interest they will show in you. But it has to be genuine.
       Retweeting me 25 times a day is not going to get me to show
       interest in you and your business.

   Now, there are different kinds of influencers, so you should have
   specific profiles and goals in mind. Are you looking for leaders in
   your industry who might help build your reputation through association?
   Or perhaps you're looking for key C-level executives who can help you
   land critical accounts, or perhaps someone else.

   Finding these influencers is achieved a couple of different ways. You
   can do a quick search and change to Twitter Users. Type in names or
   keywords or businesses or whatever makes sense for the kind of person
   you're looking for, and see what comes up. Within the list of Twitter
   users, you can click on any name and their profile will pop up and you
   can decide whether or not you want to follow that person. Or,
   alternatively, you can search on topics and look for people talking
   about and demonstrating expertise and influence in specific areas.
   A profile bio within HootSuite A profile bio within HootSuite

   When looking at someone's Twitter bio within HootSuite, you can see how
   many followers they have, how many updates they've posted, their
   location and their Bio text. You can also select a Timeline tab to see
   their latest tweets. The Bio tab also includes an interesting stat:
   their Klout score. While there's non-stop debate over the validity and
   usefulness of Klout as a measurement, in this instance, I think it's
   tremendously valuable. If you're looking for someone in your industry
   who has demonstrated significant online influence, the higher their
   Klout score the better. Now, the actual number for the Klout score will
   vary by industry. Someone who's nationally known may have a Klout score
   of 80+, but you may not need or even want that caliber of influencer.
   Smaller businesses, particularly local businesses, are going to want to
   identify and connect with people who are influential, but also
   approachable. My guess is that you'll want to target people with a
   Klout score between 50 - 70, but again, your specific business, region
   and industry may vary.

   Once you've identified someone, following them is just the first step.
   You should then begin to form a relationship with that individual, and
   spend an appropriate amount of time compared to what you hope to get
   out of the relationship. You may want to add that person to a new or
   existing Twitter List to help keep tabs on the profile, and can do so
   using the Add to List button at the bottom of the bio box. You can send
   them a Direct Message if you think it would be appropriate, but
   generally I advise starting by making it a point to regularly retweet,
   favorite and reply to the tweets they're sending on a daily basis.
   Begin to start conversations with these individuals, and make
   intelligent comments. Ask good questions and offer genuine, thoughtful
   compliments, and you will begin to make an impression. At an
   appropriate time, Make The Ask - whatever it is you are hoping they
   will do for you, whether it's to make an introduction, retweet one of
   your tweets, or something else.

   By laying the groundwork of retweeting, favoriting and other comments,
   you've created value for the influencer. That way, when you ask them to
   do something for you, they'll feel like they're reciprocating, and not
   just doing you a favor.

Mobile Listening

   Mobile search streams Mobile search streams

   With the [45]Hootsuite mobile app, you can set up and save Twitter
   searches and streams similar to the Desktop dashboard.

   You can add a new stream and set up to search, or, even easier, start a
   new search and if you like it, save it as a stream.

   These are the ways businesses can use HootSuite to listen to the
   conversations taking place on social media, whether about the brand or
   the industry, and look for opportunities to connect with and engage
   customers and potential customers.

   Hi Hootesuite Team!

   I'm working on a listening board for a company with multiple social
   media accounts that I don't have access to. So every listening board is
   loaded with content generated by the company. Is there any way to
   eliminate a particular account (or accounts) from your stream while
   still monitoring conversations relating to them? This would be most
   helpful in Twitter.

   Thanks for the post! Is there a way to just see posts that have had a
   certain amount of engagement? For example, with tweetdeck you can set a
   stream to show a certain word or tag that shows up in tweets that have
   been retweeted X amount of times. This really helps cut through the
   chaff to get to the wheat!

   Hi there!
   There's some modules for tracking Mentions (counts and details),
   Retweets and follower growth, depending on what Engagement aspect
   you're wanting to look into.

   Hi [84]@HootSuite_Help_Desk,

   I seem to have trouble setting up a Facebook search for a phrase. I'd
   like to monitor the phrase "roy morgan" but it brings back any post
   with Roy and Morgan anywhere in the post. Is there a way to define to
   phrase so it only brings back posts with the two words together? It
   only seems to be an issue with Facebook search.

   Hi [85]@alex_d13

   Thank you for your question - I'm happy to help clarify.

   The Facebook search results are being generated by Facebook's search
   feature, which is not able to isolate results that include all the
   search terms. We certainly understand that this would be an ideal
   function and will update when it is possible via the Facebook API.

   Hey the hootesuite team :)

   I do love the monitoring skils of Hootesuite, which I use daily to
   monitor what people are saying about my compagny ( on Facebook and
   Twitter ).  It perfectly works for Twitter, and it was the same for
   Facebook until yesterday  :(  I don't undestand why : yesterday my
   Facebook search stream was full of posts mentioning my company , and
   this morning everything 's gone ...

   Do you have a solution ? Because this facebook stream on hootesuite is
   very helpful . I saw all the public facebook posts about my compagny
   ... Is there a reason why it suddenly stopped ?

   Sorry to hear you're seeing issues with your Facebook streams. As a
   first step, can you please try the following:
   1. Revoke HootSuite's access to your Facebook by
   clicking [87]https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications and the
   'x' next to HootSuite.
   2. Once completed, please proceed to reconnect your Facebook in your

   This was very helpful. I've set up streams to follow specific Twitter
   users using the From:(twitter handle) Search Criteria. Some handles
   show "No Results Found." Is there a reason I can't follow anyone?
   Hootsuite_Help_Desk
   Hootsuite_Help_Desk moderator 5pts

   [93]@BrookeS  Hi Brooke! There are a few reasons that you might be
   seeing that in your streams.

   For example, through the API we currently can search up to 7 days back
   so if that handle hasn't tweeted anything in the past week, you'll get
   no results. There's also a chance that the user is private or perhaps
   their tweets aren't being fully indexed by Twitter. You can check this
   by running the same search on Twitter natively.

   I hope that helps Brooke but if you have any further questions don't
   hesitate to get in touch with us over Twitter @HootSuite_Help!

   It's also worth noting that "if appropriate" is something to be
   considered when engaging via these listening tools. Monitoring
   relevant, non branded topics looking for sales opportunities crosses an
   important line among users. Companies may think they're providing value
   because they've pointed someone who's frustrated with their credit card
   company to their credit card options, but that sort of thing can really
   be off-putting. Gathering insights is important, but when to engage and
   when to simply sit back and listen are important areas to think about
   when strategizing on social.

   Thanks for a great post with some very useful information!
