While Sprig knew there was was a so-called \"magic moment\" when customers became die-hard repeat users of the product, Sprig didn't know exactly when that moment occurred.\r\n\r\nThat's where Social Capital quickly stepped in. Jonathan Hsu and Ray Ko spent years finding those magic moments for Facebook, from the number of friends a new user needed to have to become active to the number of daily or monthly users a new product needed to reach&nbsp;critical mass. Now on the growth team at Social Capital, they walked into Sprig and started quickly pulling Sprig's data directly from its sources using advanced queries. Suddenly Sprig knew exactly how many meals a customer needed to order to get hooked on the product within a week or a month. And that allowed Sprig to market smarter, measuring different advertising streams by their ability to get customers to that key number of meals as a primary point of comparison. \"I had no idea they'd be able to run analysis more effectively and quicker than our own team could,\" says Sprig CEO Gagan Biyani.\r\n\r\nOn any given day, Hsu and Ko are performing such small data miracles for the portfolio companies backed by Social Capital. Startups know&nbsp;that collecting as much data as possible was, in general, a good thing. What they can actually do with that data isn't as obvious. \"We've had startups where the partners say, Jonathan, go do your thing,\" says Hsu. \"And I was used to very large amounts of data at Facebook. So if you have a million rows of data, you're not necessarily equipped.\" Hsu and the growth team would sift through that&nbsp;data and come back with weekly updates on the lifetime value of a customer (LTV), how different types of cohorts of customers were spending or engaging, and more. Social Capital managing partner Chamath Palihapitiya began calling it the \"magic 8-ball.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the 8-ball tells a startup is how healthy its growth really is. Every startup wants high numbers of new users. But&nbsp;new users that don't stick around or cost too much to bring in can set a startup on a path of ever-increasing costs to attract more and more customers that won't ever make it profitable.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_6620\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-6620\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/alexkonrad/files/2016/02/jonathan-hsu-socialcapital-hi-res-1200x1650.jpg\" alt=\"Social Capital's data whiz, Jonathan Hsu.\" data-height=\"1650\" data-width=\"1200\"> Social Capital's data whiz, Jonathan Hsu.[/caption]\r\n\r\nSocial Capital gives that data to startups it meets with even if they don't invest. But now the firm is doing something more radical: open-source its basic 8-ball functions for any startup to use in a public \"<a href=\"https://analytics.socialcapital.com/eightball/login?mode=select\">Diligence Tool</a>\" that can tell startups whether they've hit product-market fit and are making customers happy&nbsp;<em>before</em> they meet with venture capital firms to try to raise money and realize they can't answer those questions.\r\n\r\n\"Even startups growing fast always have the potential to grow faster,\" says Brett Kopf, CEO of Remind, another Social Capital portfolio company. When Social Capital invested in Remind, Kopf says he'd already found product-market fit; watching the data closely, however, kept the growth team led by his brother and cofounder David Kopf from\"going down a rabbit hole.\" But Kopf cautions that startups should make sure that their focus remains on solving real problems for their customers before they worry about how their growth and retention numbers might look. \"Data is very important, but if you don't have any users, it's pointless,\" Kopf says. \"These tools will be very valuable to early startups, as long as they've actually built something that solves a real problem first.\"\r\n\r\nStartups that try out the tools can use Google authentication to run the 8-ball on their data without ever sharing it with the venture firm. Social Capital doesn't ever have to know that a startup's used the tools, Hsu says.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal, as&nbsp;he explains in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jonathanhsu/diligence-at-social-capital-epilogue-introducing-the-8-ball-and-gaap-for-startups-7ab215c378bc#.4ld3kfbsl\">blog post</a> about the 8-ball, Hsu is to create a standardized group of metrics that startups can turn to, much like the GAAP accounting procedures used by public companies. In doing so, Social Capital hopes it can do a service for the entire startup ecosystem, but there's a selfish reason, too, Hsu says:&nbsp;saving investors, especially Social Capital, precious time. By educating startups earlier, growth teams like his and Ko's can focus on more complicated, advanced problems to tackle with their portfolio's data, while startups that aren't hitting the numbers investors will expect can focus on that before wasting their own and an investor's&nbsp;time. That would be a relief for Hsu.&nbsp;\"It can be very repetitive when every time you meet a company, you have to go back to square one with this stuff,\" he says. \"Instead I can focus on, how can I make your company better?\"","description":"Social Capital's growth hackers are used to helping startups figure out the healthiness of their growth by jumping into their data.

While Sprig knew there was was a so-called “magic moment” when customers became die-hard repeat users of the product, Sprig didn’t know exactly when that moment occurred.</p>\n<p>That’s where Social Capital quickly stepped in. Jonathan Hsu and Ray Ko spent years finding those magic moments for Facebook, from the number of friends a new user needed to have to become active to the number of daily or monthly users a new product needed to reach&nbsp;critical mass. Now on the growth team at Social Capital, they walked into Sprig and started quickly pulling Sprig’s data directly from its sources using advanced queries. Suddenly Sprig knew exactly how many meals a customer needed to order to get hooked on the product within a week or a month. And that allowed Sprig to market smarter, measuring different advertising streams by their ability to get customers to that key number of meals as a primary point of comparison. “I had no idea they’d be able to run analysis more effectively and quicker than our own team could,” says Sprig CEO Gagan Biyani.</p>\n<p>On any given day, Hsu and Ko are performing such small data miracles for the portfolio companies backed by Social Capital. Startups know&nbsp;that collecting as much data as possible was, in general, a good thing. What they can actually do with that data isn’t as obvious. “We’ve had startups where the partners say, Jonathan, go do your thing,” says Hsu. “And I was used to very large amounts of data at Facebook. So if you have a million rows of data, you’re not necessarily equipped.” Hsu and the growth team would sift through that&nbsp;data and come back with weekly updates on the lifetime value of a customer (LTV), how different types of cohorts of customers were spending or engaging, and more. Social Capital managing partner Chamath Palihapitiya began calling it the “magic 8-ball.”</p>\n<p>What the 8-ball tells a startup is how healthy its growth really is. Every startup wants high numbers of new users. But&nbsp;new users that don’t stick around or cost too much to bring in can set a startup on a path of ever-increasing costs to attract more and more customers that won’t ever make it profitable.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_6620\"> \n <img class=\"size-large wp-image-6620\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/alexkonrad/files/2016/02/jonathan-hsu-socialcapital-hi-res-1200x1650.jpg\" alt=\"Social Capital's data whiz, Jonathan Hsu.\" data-height=\"1650\" data-width=\"1200\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Social Capital’s data whiz, Jonathan Hsu.</p> \n</div>\n<p>Social Capital gives that data to startups it meets with even if they don’t invest. But now the firm is doing something more radical: open-source its basic 8-ball functions for any startup to use in a public “<a href=\"https://analytics.socialcapital.com/eightball/login?mode=select\">Diligence Tool</a>” that can tell startups whether they’ve hit product-market fit and are making customers happy&nbsp;<em>before</em> they meet with venture capital firms to try to raise money and realize they can’t answer those questions.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>“Even startups growing fast always have the potential to grow faster,” says Brett Kopf, CEO of Remind, another Social Capital portfolio company. When Social Capital invested in Remind, Kopf says he’d already found product-market fit; watching the data closely, however, kept the growth team led by his brother and cofounder David Kopf from”going down a rabbit hole.” But Kopf cautions that startups should make sure that their focus remains on solving real problems for their customers before they worry about how their growth and retention numbers might look. “Data is very important, but if you don’t have any users, it’s pointless,” Kopf says. “These tools will be very valuable to early startups, as long as they’ve actually built something that solves a real problem first.”</p>\n<p>Startups that try out the tools can use Google authentication to run the 8-ball on their data without ever sharing it with the venture firm. Social Capital doesn’t ever have to know that a startup’s used the tools, Hsu says.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal, as&nbsp;he explains in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jonathanhsu/diligence-at-social-capital-epilogue-introducing-the-8-ball-and-gaap-for-startups-7ab215c378bc#.4ld3kfbsl\">blog post</a> about the 8-ball, Hsu is to create a standardized group of metrics that startups can turn to, much like the GAAP accounting procedures used by public companies. In doing so, Social Capital hopes it can do a service for the entire startup ecosystem, but there’s a selfish reason, too, Hsu says:&nbsp;saving investors, especially Social Capital, precious time. By educating startups earlier, growth teams like his and Ko’s can focus on more complicated, advanced problems to tackle with their portfolio’s data, while startups that aren’t hitting the numbers investors will expect can focus on that before wasting their own and an investor’s&nbsp;time. That would be a relief for Hsu.&nbsp;”It can be very repetitive when every time you meet a company, you have to go back to square one with this stuff,” he says. “Instead I can focus on, how can I make your company better?”</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology"},{"id":"channel_3section_141","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Game Changers","url":"/game-changers"},{"id":"channel_3section_17","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Cloud Computing","url":"/cloud-computing"}],"pTagCount":9,"digestDisabled":false,"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2438","name":"Lost In The Alley","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/alexkonrad/profile/","authorType":"individual","tagName":"Covering Silicon Alley&#039;s ad and tech scenes","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1455817260426,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2438","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/557670","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/557670","name":"Alex Konrad","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/edf4a506f11616b8d1d56cccb42f697c?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/edf4a506f11616b8d1d56cccb42f697c?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/edf4a506f11616b8d1d56cccb42f697c?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/edf4a506f11616b8d1d56cccb42f697c?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"Staff writer for venture capital, startups and enterprise tech.","description":"I'm a staff writer covering venture capital, enterprise and NY startups.
