   What The Heck Are Cocos and Why Is Everyone Freaking Out About Them?

   The global market sell-off that [552]continued Thursday in the United
   States can be blamed on a lot of things, including China's economic
   slowdown, low oil prices, and uncertainty about the U.S. Federal
   Reserve's monetary policy. But there's one obscure investment
   instrument that's also contributing to the panic, especially in Europe,
   that is spilling across the Atlantic: Coco bonds.

   Coco bonds are formally known as contingent convertible [553]bonds.
   They were [554]created in [555]Europe by financial regulators as an
   insurance policy after the Great Recession to ensure taxpayers would
   not have to bail out banks if another crisis occurs and banks fall
   short on cash.

   Here's how they work. Cocos are a type of debt, with a string attached.
   Banks issue these bonds to buyers to raise cash. If a pre-agreed event
   occurs -- say a stock price drops to a certain level -- then the
   holders of the debt get an equity stake in the bank. This is the
   contingent.

   They differ from normal bank bonds in that key way. If a bank -- say
   Deutsche Bank, an [556]institution whose health is at the center of
   Europe's financial sector worries -- is unable to pay off a normal
   bond, it would negotiate with the bond holder to pay off some of what
   it owes. This can be a long and complicated process.

   Cocos allow bondholders to skip this. If a bank is short on cash and
   can't keep up interest payments, then the borrower gets an equity stake
   in the bank, as opposed to having to negotiate a pay back. That's the
   convertible part -- debt converts into equity.

   They were devised so that governments -- and therefore taxpayers --
   wouldn't have to step in to help struggling banks. If banks run low on
   cash and can't keep up interest payments, the bonds convert.

   This solves two problems: the bank's debt load lessens, and its capital
   supplies increase because it has a new equity holder. Bond holders may
   not get all of their money back -- which is why Cocos are considered
   very risky investments -- but they will get a an equity stake in the
   bank that issued the Coco.

   In Europe, the price of Cocos is plummeting, along with the value of
   European banks, some of which are down 40 [557]percent on the year to
   date. Investors who hold Coco bonds are worried they won't get their
   money back, and will be left holding shares in a bank that are far less
   valuable than what they paid for the bond.

   For instance, earlier this week, Deutsche Bank's 1.75 billion euro, or
   $1.98 billion, Coco bonds [558]traded at 70 cents on the euro, as
   compared to 93 cents earlier this year. That's the lowest level ever.

   Concerns about the health of European banks trigger flashbacks to 2008,
   when U.S. banks, as well as banks in Europe, needed a bailout to avoid
   potentially collapsing, as Lehman Brothers did. Like them or not, banks
   are the heart of the global financial system. If they fail, the rest of
   the body fails with them.

   "2008 is not that far away, and people still remember what happened
   then," Benno Galliker, a trader at Luzerner Kantonalbank AG, told
   [559]Bloomberg. "It's kind of scary."

   That's on top of the uncertainty about European banks to the stew of
   China's slower-than-expected growth, historically low oil prices, and
   global equity drops. Germany's DAX was down 3 [560]percent Thursday,
   the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong [561]dropped 4 percent, and the Dow
   Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.6 [562]percent. Then add
   concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates next
   month because it fears it would hurt U.S. growth, an admission of
   economic weakness. It's why 2016 is off to such a bad start.
