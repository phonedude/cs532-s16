Using D3, create a graph of the Karate club before and after
the split.\\
\\
- Weight the edges with the data from:\\ 
\url{http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/ucinet/zachary.dat}\\
\\
- Have the transition from before/after the split occur on a mouse
click.  This is a toggle, so the graph will go back and forth between
connected and disconnected.
