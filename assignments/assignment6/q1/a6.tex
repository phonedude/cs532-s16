Use D3 to visualize your Twitter followers.  Use my twitter account
(\enquote{{@}phonedude\_mln}) if you do not have $>=$ 50 followers.  For example,
{@}hvdsomp follows me, as does {@}mart1nkle1n.  They also follow each
other, so they would both have links to me and links to each other.\\
\\
To see if two users follow each other, see:\\

\\
Attractiveness of the graph counts!  Nodes should be labeled (avatar
images are even better), and edge types (follows, following) should
be marked.\\

Note: for getting GitHub to serve HTML (and other media types), see:\\

Be sure to include the URI(s) for your D3 graph in your report.
