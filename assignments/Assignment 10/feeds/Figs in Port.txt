<title>Figs in Port</title>
<description>

 
Figs cooked until semi tender in a Port reduction makes a light, elegant and very delicious dessert. Going further by adding a small amount of chocolate to the reduction, just enough to taste the complex flavor notes in both Port and chocolate is even more special. For certain cooking/baking applications decent Port will do, but when Port is used as the principal nucleus, it is a must to use the better type.
Very seldom will I suggest brands, but here it is important as the wrong Port will not create the dessert you are after. For this particular application I prefer a graceful Port, rich in flavor reminiscent of sweet red berries and ending with a fresh velvety finish. The 10 year old Tawny Porto by Croft will provide just that.
Besides Port, figs also love the company of a touch of spice, serving this dessert with Speculoos/ Speculaas cookies or speculoos gelato can be a brilliant combination.
Frequently (also as dessert) I serve this at home with a selection of aged cheese and artisan bread. In such case I do omit the chocolate.

Cut figs in half and set aside.
In a saucepan heat Port and sugar until nearly reduced.
Add figs, cut side down and cook on low-medium heat until figs are thoroughly heated and are “a dente”.
Place on a preheated serving plate and quickly reduce remaining port until it coats the back of a spoon. Swirl in chocolate and pour onto figs. Serve.
