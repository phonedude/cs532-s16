<title>Fig Tart</title>
<description>

Figs are at their best when enhanced with recognizable but non overpowering flavors. For many fig varieties, I like to use mascarpone or a white chocolate cream, which improves the delicate sweetness of the fig and consequently increase its flavor.  Figs love to be in company of honey, white chocolate, Rum, Amaretto, mascarpone, oranges, toasted almonds, Port….
The miniature figs I used here were grown in Texas and given to me by Marcel, a great student of mine.

Pay close attention to the method and temperatures to avoid a disappointing result.
Bring the cream, milk and vanilla bean to a boil in a small saucepan. Meanwhile in a bowl, whisk the egg yolks smooth and very rapidly whisk in the honey.
Pour a quarter of the boiling cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture and whisk quickly. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the heated cream and on low heat stir the mixture to 183⁰F (81⁰C) while CONSTANTLY stirring using a rubber spatula. Remove from heat and pour into another bowl to stop the cooking process.
Add the bloomed gelatin. Stir in the chopped chocolate. Chop the candied orange peel and add along with Grand Marnier.
Set and stir over ice to 40°F (4°C). Pour into prebaked tart shells and allow to set in a refrigerator.
Decorate with figs and finish with neutral glaze.
