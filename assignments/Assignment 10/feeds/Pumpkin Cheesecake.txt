Not every country in the world is fond of pumpkin desserts but for the places which do, pumpkin cheesecake is a welcoming finish to a good meal. A nice thing about using pumpkin in cheesecake is that pumpkin makes this dessert lighter in fat calories, enhances the creaminess and makes the dessert very fitting for the fall season.  For any type of cheesecake I recommend baking the crust separate and placing the baked and cooled cheesecake onto the baked crust. This prevents a disappointing bottom.  The flavor profile of this cheesecake works very well if placed on prebaked gingersnap crumbles or speculaas (speculoos).

 
Pumpkin Cheesecake
About 30 individual servings




3 lb
Cream cheese (Philadelphia)
1440 g



1 lb 8 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
720 g



8
Large eggs
8



2 teaspoon
Vanilla extract
10 g



¼ teaspoon
Salt
1 g









2 tbps
Orange zest
6 g









1 Tbsp
Cinnamon (Vietnamese Cassia)
6 g



2 tsp
Ginger, dried
4 g



1 lb 14 oz
Pumpkin puree, cooked
900 g














































 Allow the cream cheese to come at room temperature for easy blending.
 Combine the cream cheese and the sugar on low speed until smooth and no lumps remain. Scrape well.
 Add eggs one at a time waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated before adding next. Scrape often in between.
 Add all the flavorings and the pumpkin puree.
 Brush rings lightly with oil and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Wrap two sheets of aluminum foil underneath each ring and place in a roasting pan or a pan with high edges. Fill the rings with the batter.
 Pour water into the roasting pan to create a Bain Marie, about ½ inch (2 cm) of water surrounding the rings.
 Place in a 325°F (160°C) oven and bake until the center is set and no longer trembles, about 43 minutes.
 Allow to cool for several hours in the refrigerator before removing from the ring.
 If desired spray with cocoa butter and decorate as desired.
