<title>White Chocolate Cremeux</title>
<description>

If there is one ingredient which Pastry Chefs feel a bit uneasy about using in the pastry kitchen, it must be white chocolate. We know very well that many people consider white chocolate not real chocolate and most of us are not smitten with white chocolate the same way as we are with milk and or dark chocolate.  However, at times just a piece of good quality chocolate can be satisfying. To make a dessert containing white chocolate successful I like to incorporate several textures such as Gerbet macaron, Pate de fruit, streusel….Some fruits I like to harmonize with white chocolate include Red and black currants, raspberries, tart cherries and others.
Preparations containing white chocolate need to be made with a minimum of sugar or the result will be simply too sweet. Therefore white chocolate cannot be used the same way dark chocolate can. For example a dark chocolate mousse may contain a meringue while using a meringue in a white chocolate mousse would make it way too sweet.

In this white chocolate cremeux only a minimum amount of sugar is used to have a balanced level of sweetness.

Pay close attention to the method and temperatures to avoid a disappointing result.
Bring the cream, milk and vanilla bean to a boil in a small saucepan. Meanwhile in a bowl, whisk the egg yolks smooth and very rapidly whisk in the sugar. Make sure no egg yolk and sugar lumps are still visible.
Pour a quarter of the boiling cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture and whisk quickly. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the heated cream and on low heat stir the mixture to 183⁰F (81⁰C) while CONSTANTLY stirring using a rubber spatula. Remove from heat and pour into another bowl to stop the cooking process. Add the bloomed gelatin leaf if using. (Using the gelatin will naturally provide a slight firmer setting)
Add the chocolate and using an immersion blender or whisk blend the mixture smooth. Add the liquor and pour into glasses and place covered in a refrigerator.
The cremeux will set in a few hours. Serve with sour cherry coulis, Gerbet macaroons, streusel and fresh cherries.
