<title>Semi Candied Strawberries</title>
<description>

For certain desserts I like to use semi candied strawberries. The reason is twofold. One, the flavor is simply incomparable and two, when I make desserts which need to be frozen, semi candied strawberries survive freezing without a hitch.
It would be dishonest to say that semi candied strawberries are not sweet. They are, so when I use these I make certain they are combined with other ingredients which will balance their sweetness. For example, I like to mix semi candied strawberries with fresh raspberries, spoon it on gelato and give it a drizzle of raspberry infused-balsamic vinegar reduction.

Correctly made they are beautiful and if you are faced with strawberries that are disappointing, semi candy them to improve the flavor tremendously.
Getting It All Together!
Semi candied strawberries are quick to make and can be used a few hours after preparation or the following day.
