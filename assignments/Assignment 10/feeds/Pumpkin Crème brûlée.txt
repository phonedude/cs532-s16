<title>Pumpkin Crème brûlée</title>
<description>

In many countries around the world American classics such as chocolate chip cookies, brownies, muffins and several others have become quite popular.  It would be interesting to know if in a decade or so pumpkin desserts will follow the same path. To be honest, the very first time I tasted pumpkin pie, I was immediately smitten. The whole thing reminded me of a dessert I grew up with in Belgium named Vlaai. Not exactly the same but it still reminds me of it, I call it pure home style unapologetic goodness.

During the Fall, in North America pumpkin pies are very popular and along with pecan pie and sweet potato pie, are served nearly everywhere on the Thanksgiving Holiday. For certain occasions when I need the dessert to be less home style I turn towards pumpkin crème brûlée. Similar ingredients just used in a different ratio.

One of the things I have discovered is that Fresh pumpkins can be tremendous in savory foods but when it comes down to desserts, it is a slightly different story. The leading canned pumpkin manufacturer in the United States has managed to perfect and grow a variety of pumpkins which sweetness, texture and color is ideal for desserts.   Thus I do not fuss with fresh pumpkins unless if I make pumpkin curry soup.
On the ratio of pumpkin to cream… when questioned, most people prefer a crème brûlée with a pumpkin flavor. If what you are looking for is more pumpkin and less crème flavor than I would decrease the cream and increase the pumpkin.
Getting It All Together!
Just as standard Crème brûlée this one can also be made a day or so ahead of time. For the décor use a pumpkin tuile and or caramelized pecans.
