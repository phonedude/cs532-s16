Chocolates filled with liqueur are some of the more complex types of confections made. One classic method to prepare these is to pour liqueur syrup into starch molds, which is a technique that easily can result in disappointment. Many factors such as dryness of starch, humidity of work environment, and syrup have an effect on the success of these confections. A simpler and quicker manner is to fill purchased truffle shells with liquor syrup. Either process, when correctly finished in the right work environment, the surface of the liqueur syrup will obtain a crystallized sugar shell which is then enrobed in couverture chocolate.
Although this may be a classic method of sealing liqueur into chocolates, one may question if it is really the best. Many people feel objection to the crunchy sugar shell and it is their primary reason why they do not consume these. Let’s be honest, it is an odd texture indeed and no other chocolates contain crystallized sugar. If crystallized sugar was delicious or had great texture, we certainly would include it into other chocolates.
Alternatives to crystallized sugar crust are possible and may have their own set of issues; however they still are my preferred method for making liqueur filled chocolates.

Irish Cream Liqueur




8 oz
Whipping cream
240 g



1 oz
Chocolate (54-66% Cocoa mass)
30 g



2 teaspoon
Instant coffee
4 g



14 oz
Sweetened condensed milk
420 g



8 oz
Whiskey (smooth)
240 g









1 teaspoon
Vanilla extract
5 g









 
 
 



 
 
 



























































































































1 Bring heavy cream to a boil. Pour onto chocolate and coffee extract and blend smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk. Pour in Whiskey and vanilla. Allow to completely cool.
2.Make chocolate shells that will provide a flat surface when turned upside down. (no round domes!)
3. Spread couverture onto acetate and cut matching shapes which are slightly larger than mold. Once cut flip upside down and cover with heavy board to keep the cutouts perfectly flat. (Very important)
4. The remaining work is best done with 2 people: Dip the edge of each molded chocolate into tempered (on the warm side) couverture chocolate and fill immediately with liqueur (using a squeeze bottle is a good option). Quickly top with chocolate cutout.
Yields about 90-100 chocolates.
