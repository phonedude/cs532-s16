<title>Black Rice Cream</title>
<description>

In many parts of the world desserts made with rice have been popular for centuries and are often made into home style versions. Milk, sugar, cinnamon sticks, vanilla bean and rice is cooked until the rice is tender and the mixture has turned into a creamy consistency.  Nothing particularly wrong with that, but most of us need to be a little more creative to entice today’s consumer.
Some people dislike the typical mouth feel of rice desserts but this can easily be manipulated. For instance, in the dessert featured here whipped cream is folded in, which quickly transforms a thick and heavy texture to a lighter and creamy one. Adding fruit to rice desserts works extraordinarily well to further enhance the overall eating sensation.  Many types of fruit work very well with rice desserts, from sweet to slightly tart.
Not everyone is familiar with black rice therefore I like to share that black rice is not necessarily better tasting compared to white rice. However it is indeed eye catching. Black rice takes a very long time to become tender but it does provide the rice cream a rather nice lavender hue. Certainly this dessert can easily be made with short grain rice which will make the cooking time much shorter.

Coconut Black Rice Cream
Yield: 6-8 servings
 




1 quart  3 oz
Homemade coconut milk
1 lit



6 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
180 g



1
Vanilla bean, split
1



pinch
Salt
pinch



6 oz
Black rice (forbidden rice)
180 g









12 oz
Whipping cream
360 g











 


























































 Combine the homemade coconut milk, sugar, split vanilla bean, salt and black rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
 Cover and simmer on very low heat until the rice is tender, about 2 hours. If necessary add a small amount of milk to keep the mixture properly hydrated.
 Remove from heat and allow to cool.
 Whip the whipping cream to very soft peaks. Before folding the cream into the rice ensure that the rice mixture is creamy and will allow for easy folding in of the cream. If necessary add a small amount of milk.
 Pour into glasses and place in a refrigerator. Once cold decorate as desired.  This dessert is served with Mango-passion fruit coulis.
