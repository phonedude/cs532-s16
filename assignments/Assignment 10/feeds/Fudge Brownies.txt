<title>Fudge Brownies</title>
<description>

Some people prefer cake-like brownies but the majority of people in North America favor fudge-like brownies.  Moist and gooey with a deep and well balanced chocolate flavor.  Due to the richness this is not the type of brownie you desire as a large piece.  I suggest you keep these under refrigeration since at room temperature they will get rather soft.  If you desire to make a version which is less moist or fudgy add some flour and or cocoa powder.  A less fudgy brownie works very well when heated in a microwave and served with gelato. Non alkalized cocoa is preferred here since the recipe contains baking soda which will naturally alkalize the cocoa powder and provide a very good chocolate flavor.  In terms of chocolate, I use a chocolate of 45% cocoa mass in these brownies.  You could use a chocolate with a higher amount of cocoa mass but keep in mind that brownies need sugar to obtain a fudge-like consistency.  Consequently a brownie made with higher cocoa mass levels will be less fudge-like.
Nuts are delicious in brownies and many types work very well. In this particular brownie I used pre-toasted hazelnuts and candied orange peel.  A personal favorite, however choose a combination which is appealing and makes financial sense in your part of the world.
