<title>Kumquat Pink Grapefruit Marmalade</title>
<description>

Marmalades with fresh tasting and refined flavor notes can be very delicious on scones, toast, fillings for certain cakes etc. Combining varieties of citrus into marmalade can create most delectable results and I suggest being adventurous in creating your own. For this particular recipe I use in my opinion, two of some of the most underused fruits in the baking lab: kumquats and Pink Grapefruit. A delightful combination that I particularly like to use with chocolate desserts.
Citrus contains an abundance of pectin which can make the preparation of marmalades quick and efficient and leads to “fresh” (not cooked) flavors. For some citrus marmalades or gelée with low amounts of peel (therefore low amounts of pectin) I will bundle the seeds in a cheesecloth pouch and cook along with the mixture. Seeds of citrus contain pectin as well which will be released during cooking. In general I prefer to use organic fruits when I will use the peel or zest since they are treated with chemicals.
 
Kumquat Pink Grapefruit Marmalade
 




13.5 oz
Kumquats
400 g



1 oz
Pink Grapefruit zest
30 g



13.5 oz
Grapefruit-meat only
400 g



1 lb 8 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
700 g



















































 
 

















































































































Slice kumquats in thin slices and place in a nonreactive saucepan. Add grapefruit zest and grapefruit meats cut in small pieces. Add sugar and combine.
Allow sugar to melt to make stirring over heat easier. Bring to a boil while stirring and simmer on low for approximately 20 minutes or until properly thickened. Cooking on high heat will prevent sugar from penetrating the peel of kumquat and may create crystallization.
If cooked to soft and slightly runny stage (ideal for filling cakes) keep marmalade frozen to prevent spoilage.
