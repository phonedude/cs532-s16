<title>Hazelnut & Orange Chocolate Bar</title>
<description>
 

After talking to countless Pastry chefs and Chocolatiers who are in search of fillings for chocolates with an extended shelf life, I thought it was time to highlight such filling which may be of use to you.  This particular filling contains nougatine which adds a layer of complexity, but the good news is that the nougatine is chopped and therefore rolling it to a thickness of 2 stacked bank cards is not a total necessity.  Although on the picture this particular filling is piped into a chocolate bar mold, any shallow type of chocolate mold should work.  The filling tilts on the sweet side and therefore I do recommend to use shallow chocolate mold as the flavor balance between the chocolate and the filling will then be optimal. For the molding process I recommend a semi sweet chocolate couverture with a cocoa mass content of 52-58% maximum. Milk chocolate mixed with dark chocolate can also work well and be equally delicious. Using ¾ milk chocolate couverture combined with ¼ dark chocolate couverture will provide good balance. Using bitter chocolate for the molding process will make it hard to properly experience the hazelnut flavor which we all know is a rather expensive ingredient not to be noticed.
