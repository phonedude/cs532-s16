<title>Raspberry Mint Sorbet</title>
<description>

Simple desserts do not necessarily translate into boring. A minimal composition of raspberry mint sorbet sandwiched between thin sheets of cocoa nib topped chocolate is an example of such.
For most sorbets I recommend a combination of sugars such as invert sugar, glucose and granulated sugar. Invert sugar and glucose along with pectin (or other stabilizing product) will control crystallization and provide a smoother product with a very good mouth feel.  Stabilizers are especially helpful when sorbet is stored in freezers which do not maintain a steady temperature.

 
Raspberry Mint Sorbet
 










15 oz
Water
450 g



7 oz
Granulated sugar
210 g



0.33 oz
Apple pectin
10 g



4 oz
glucose
120 g



1oz
Invert sugar
30 g









0.33 oz
Mint extract
10 g









2 lb 3 oz
Raspberry puree
1000 g



























 

Pour water in saucepan. Thoroughly combine granulated sugar with pectin. Add to water, add glucose. Whisk to boil.
Allow to cool and preferably allow maturing for 4 hours (or several days) in a refrigerator before adding fruit puree.
Add invert sugar, mint extract and fruit puree.
Churn in ice cream machine. If working with a semi commercial ice cream machine ensure that the machine is not over filled, that it has been well pre-chilled and that the sorbet mixture is very cold when adding to machine.  This will ensure fast churning and thus resulting in a very smooth texture. (The longer the sorbet is being churned the larger the ice crystals will be)
