Certain plated desserts require a touch of elegance which can be achieved by a variety of means. One of them is a contemporary tuile décor. Easy and fast to make and well liked by our guest.
Getting It All Together!
Tuile decors will absorb humidity quickly, therefore it is important to make these daily or store them with a desiccant.  Another method is simply prepare the tuile batter a couple of times a week and store in the refrigerator. The batter can also be frozen.

Recipe tuile
 




4 oz
Unsalted butter, soft
120 g



4 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar   or powdered
120 g



4 oz
Egg whites (at room temperature)
120 g



1 teaspoon
Vanilla
5 g



1/8 teaspoon

Cream the butter. Add the sugar and cream well.
Add the egg whites one at a time waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated. Add vanilla and salt.
Fold in the flour.
Spread the tuile batter very thin using a stencil onto a Silpat. Bake at 400°F (200°C) until light golden.
Meanwhile bring to a boil a small amount of glucose.
Spread (in spots) a very thin amount of glucose over the still hot tuile. Return to the oven for a few minutes until the tuile is golden-brown and the glucose feels nearly dry.
Shape as desired.
