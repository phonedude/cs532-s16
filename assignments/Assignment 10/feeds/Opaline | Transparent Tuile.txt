<title>Opaline | Transparent Tuile</title>
<description>

For many desserts, Opaline also known as a transparent tuile can be an eye catching decoration. It is easy to make and it can be colored as well. Since the ingredients are basically like a lollipop, opaline can be flavored with herbs, spices, extracts etc.  Like most sugar products it is quickly affected by humidity and therefore it needs to be stored airtight with a desiccant.  To combat the humidity, I also make opaline with the addition of isomalt.

Heat the fondant and the glucose to a very pale golden color or 350°F (175°C).
Pour on a silpat and allow to cool.
Place the sugar pieces onto a parchment sheet and crush using a rolling pin into powder. (if desired crush in a food processor)
Sieve the powder over a stencil of choice onto a Silpat.
Place in a 350°F (175°C) oven until the opaline has melted. If desired curve the opaline into shapes.
