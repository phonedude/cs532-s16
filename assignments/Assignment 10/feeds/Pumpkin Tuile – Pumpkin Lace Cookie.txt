<title>Pumpkin Tuile – Pumpkin Lace Cookie</title>
<description>

Since I have a huge affinity towards desserts with pumpkin, I figured it was time to create a pumpkin tuile I could use with pumpkin desserts.  Certainly an orange or maple tuile for pumpkin desserts works fine, but since I already have recipes for such, it would not have had the challenge of testing and retesting this recipe until I had something I had envisioned.
Getting It All Together!
Like most tuiles or lace cookies this one also needs to be protected from humidity. Make the batter and whatever amount is not used place it in a refrigerator or freezer until next times use.

Pumpkin tuile
Note: Since a tuile needs very correct scaling this recipe only contains scaled and not measured amounts.




3.5 oz
Glucose
100 g



4 oz
Pumpkin puree (canned)
120 g



½ oz
All purpose or pastry flour
15 g



5 oz
Powdered sugar
150 g



2.5 oz
Melted butter
75 g


















































































In a saucepan heat to melt the glucose but do not boil. Remove from heat and stir in the pumpkin puree.
Sift together the flour and powdered sugar and whisk into the pumpkin mixture.
Whisk in the melted butter.
Add spices as desired: Ginger, cinnamon, cardamom etc.
Spread the batter in an organic fashion or stencil the batter. Bake at 375F (190C) until set and edges are turning light brown.
