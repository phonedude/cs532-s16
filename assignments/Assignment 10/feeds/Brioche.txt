Brioche with candied Buddha hand toasted hazelnuts
Good quality butter, a few ordinary ingredients and close attention to detail can make a most extraordinary brioche. The brioche I feature here is made with a sponge and therefore may not be as convenient to prepare, compared to a brioche where the dough is matured overnight in a refrigerator.
The mild lemony flavor of Candied Buddha hand in brioche is quite wonderful as it pairs with the butter flavor real well. Certainly Buddha hand can be expensive or hard to find in some countries and therefore may have to be replaced with other fruits.

Getting it all together!
Allow nearly seven hours from start to finish for this particular brioche. The fermentation can be rather slow in the beginning but do not increase the amount of yeast. Make sure you do allow the time required for the sponge to develop. A sponge is essential and ensures proper yeast activity in a very rich (Butter and eggs) environment.

Yield: 6 loaves
For the sponge:




10 oz
Water
300 g



0.5 oz
Instant yeast
15 g



9 oz
Eggs
270 g



1oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
30 g



12 oz
Bread flour
360 g


















































































Bring the water to 100°F (37°C). Whisk in the yeast and the eggs. Add the sugar and flour and combine until no lumps remain.

Main dough ingredients:




0.5 oz
Instant yeast
15 g



10 oz
Eggs
300 g



2 lb 8 oz
Bread flour
1200 g



5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar

660 g



12 oz
Candied Buddha hand, drained
360 g



12 oz
Hazelnuts, toasted
360 g



2 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
60 g








































To the fermented sponge add the instant yeast and eggs and combine well. Add the bread flour, sugar, invert sugar and salt and mix using a dough hook until the dough is elastic and forms a window.
Add the soft butter in 4-5 increments on low speed, waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated. Ensure that the dough does NOT exceed 78°F (26°C).
Add the candied Buddha hand and nuts and mix until just distributed.
Cover with plastic and allow the dough to ferment until doubled, about 60-80 minutes. Punch the dough and rest for 10 minutes.
For large Brioche molds weigh into 1 lb 4 oz (600 g) pieces for the loaves and 1.5 oz (45 g) for the center part. Make round.
Place in well buttered brioche pans and make a deep hole in the center. Place the small round in the hole. Place in a proof box until the loaves have 70% increased in size, about 60-80 minutes.
Brush with egg wash and bake in a 375°F (190°C) oven until thoroughly baked, about 42 minutes. Brioche will always obtain a dark crust, if a lighter crust is desired cover with aluminum foil near the end of baking.
