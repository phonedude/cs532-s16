<title>Cold Brewed Coffee Gelee</title>
<description>

During the summer months I always infuse or “brew” cold coffee at our home. The full and dynamic flavor with low acidity that cold brewed coffee provides is something that I love.  Infusing cold allows you to detect flavor nuances in the coffee which are nearly impossible to detect when brewed hot. Ordinarily I pour some of the cold infused coffee concentrate in some water with a touch of sugar and cream and serve it on the rocks.
At times I will add a touch of gelatin to cold brewed coffee and serve as dessert. Along with a small crème brûlée or a small amount of vanilla or chocolate gelato it is very delicious.
To make cold brewed coffee it is important to start off with excellent coffee which has no bitter or harsh undertones. My preference to use is espresso made by Kimbo ®; this Italian coffee has slight chocolate and buttery undertones which are perfect for this dessert.
Getting it all together!
The brewing or infusing process takes 12 hours so do this step ahead. The infusion will last for a week in the refrigerator.
