Candied Citrus Zest
For certain chocolates, filled croissant, and dessert in general I like to use candied orange peel. To make it properly and to ensure that the candied peel will keep, it takes about a week to prepare. A long process indeed, but the result is simply amazing. Dipped in bittersweet chocolate, candied orange peel is one of the most luxurious confections in the world. Whenever I am in Bruges I always visit an artisan chocolatier which makes delicious candied orange peel.

Making candied citrus zest as featured in this article, is a whole lot quicker and provides very good results. The main difference between the two is that candied orange peel is made from the entire peel, including the white bitter pith and candied orange zest is made from the outer layer only, the zest. For either one, I only use organic or non treated citrus fruit. It is nice to know that it is not difficult to find organic citrus which is not coated with waxes and treated with chemicals.
Candied citrus zest can be used in numerous ways, swirl it in gelato, spoon it on ice cream, mix it in sauces, mousses, use it to decorate petit fours, mix it into financier or other cake batters…….

Getting It All Together!
Candied citrus zest will last for many months in a well sealed container in the refrigerator or simply freeze it.
