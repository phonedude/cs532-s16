When we think about Valentine’s Day the heart is what primarily comes to mind. For many years the only device we had to create a heart, was a heart shape cutter. Things have changed for the better and now we have access to 3 dimensional heart shaped Flexipan. Pastry Chefs the world over, like to use these since they facilitate beautiful desserts, in quick and hygienic ways with unsurpassed results.
The possibilities are endless, whether you want to mould a lemon-passion fruit cream as shown on my site here, a Bavarian, a mousse etc.  Working Pâtissiers already know, but for the enthusiastic pastry students out there, it is important to remember that when making mousses and creams for Flexipan to keep the following in mind. If your recipe has temperature guidelines follow these strictly and make certain that the whipping cream is only whipped to a very soft consistency.  Of course these rules apply anytime, however to ensure a beautiful molded mousse or cream using Flexipan, make certain the recipe was correctly performed and this way you truly will obtain unrivaled products.  The chocolate mousse recipe below works tremendously well in Flexipan and I highly recommend you give it a try. The texture and flavor of the chocolate mousse will not disappoint.  If desired serve the chocolate mousse with raspberry sorbet and caramel tuile as featured in the picture.
