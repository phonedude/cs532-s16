<title>Peppermint Panna Cotta with Cranberry Coulis</title>
<description>

All of us in the Patisserie world know very well that during the busy Holiday season, having a quick to prepare winter dessert in your collection never hurts. This one does not disappoint and is very well liked. The combination of peppermint and cranberry is contemporary and the flavors work in perfect harmony.
In this dessert and some others, I prefer to use mint extract or mint essential oil over steeping fresh mint leaves. A good extract provides clean and fresh notes which are hard to achieve when using fresh leaves. Most often, brewed mint leaves exude grassy herbal notes which are not desired.
 
Cranberry Coulis




8 oz
Fresh or frozen Cranberries
240 g



8 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
240 g



8 oz
Water
240 g



0.5 oz

Bring cranberries, sugar and water to a boil in a non reactive saucepan. Simmer for 8-10 minutes.
Remove from heat and using an immersion blender puree until smooth.
Run through a chinois. Once cooled add liquor or a small amount of water to bring to desired consistency.
Pour a layer in glasses of choice and place in a refrigerator.
