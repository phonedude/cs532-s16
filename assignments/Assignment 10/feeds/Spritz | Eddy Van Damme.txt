<title>Spritz | Eddy Van Damme</title>
<description>

It is easy to see why so many people appreciate Sablés Viennois or Spritz, they are attractive and people like the sandy buttery texture of these simple, yet sophisticated petit four.  Whether served with espresso, tea or gelato they always prove to be a hit.
A few things are important to ensure a gorgeous baked product. One is the type of flour, if it is too weak in protein the batter may spread too much in the oven resulting in a product without clear marks on the surface.  Therefore I recommend using good quality pastry flour. Second, do not over cream butter as this will create too much spreading of the product in the oven. Resulting in lost surface marks as well.
Baking is best done in a deck using ample bottom heat to ensure that jam will not stick to silpat when petit four are removed. If using a convection oven I recommend using a thinly made baking tray or perforated baking tray.
