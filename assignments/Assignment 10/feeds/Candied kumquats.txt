<title>Candied kumquats</title>
<description>

Kumquats are some of the quickest and least complicated fruits to candy. From start to finish, semi candied kumquats can be achieved within 40 minutes.  A drastic time difference compared to the preparation of candied orange peels which are blanched several times to remove bitterness from the peel and are then followed by an extensive candying process.
Semi candied kumquats are well liked by our customers, therefore if you have desserts which you want to enhance with an orange-citrus component, they can be an excellent choice. Think about adding semi candied kumquats to gelato, layered in entremets, yogurt desserts, in cheesecake, in ganache etc.
