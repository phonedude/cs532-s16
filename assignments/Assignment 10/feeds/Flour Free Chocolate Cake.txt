<title>Flour Free Chocolate Cake</title>
<description>

To make certain bakery items gluten free it may be necessary to replace wheat flour with tapioca, rice, bean and or other flours, but at times, great results can also be obtained without using any of these at all. Case in point this featured chocolate hazelnut layer cake, which is moist, all natural and has a perfect texture.

Oftentimes we forget that cocoa powder contains a good amount of starch and fiber, ingredients which absorb moisture and are part of the cake building structure. Therefore making a cake without flour in case of a chocolate cake is not very complicated. In fact by simply manipulating the ingredients a perfect chocolate cake without flour can easily be obtained.



Getting it all together!
If you want to obtain sharply cut sides on the cake it is best to bake, fill and assemble the cake and then freeze it. Frost it the next day with room temperature ganache than freeze it, give it a second coat with heated ganache or cocoa gelée and cut while frozen.
Chocolate Cake without Flour
Yield: 1 full sheet pan



12
(8   oz)
Egg   yolks
240   g


1 tsp
(1   tsp)
Vanilla extract
5 ml


12
(12   oz)
Egg whites
360   g


1 ½ Cups
(12   oz)
Extra fine granulated sugar
360   g


½ Cup
(4   oz)
Cocoa powder, sifted
120   g








1 Cup
(4   oz)
Toasted hazelnut or almond flour
120 g






































































Whip the egg yolks to a mousse consistency, add the vanilla and set aside.
Whip the egg whites and granulated sugar to stiff peaks
Right before folding the egg yolks into the egg whites give the egg whites a good whip to make them “creamy” and make it easier for the remaining ingredients to be homogenized into the batter. Gently fold the yolks into the egg whites. It is not necessary to fold the mixture until all the yolk streaks are gone.
Gently fold in the cocoa powder and nut flour.
Spread the batter on a parchment lined full sheet pan and bake in a 350F (180C) oven until the cake bounces back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.




Assembly:

Once cooled cut the cake crosswise in 4 equal strips. Spread low sugar raspberry jam (On Baking pg 620) on one layer and cover with another layer. Repeat until all used. Do not cover with jam on the top layer.
Spread a thin layer of room temperature ganache (On Baking page 494) on the surface.
If desired coat with a layer of heated Cocoa gelée (On Baking pg 560) for a brilliant finish.
Cut into desired size.
