<title>Tiramisu | Speculoos</title>
<description>

 
 
Mascarpone cream/mousse is very delicious when combined with the complex flavor of speculoos (speculaas). For desserts which nod to Tiramisu, I make ladyfingers containing speculoos spices. Not necessarily a true authentic way of making tiramisu, but delicious nonetheless.
On speculoos / speculaas, recently several books have published recipes for these cookies containing nothing more than cinnamon as the only spice. Authentic speculoos is much more complex and much more delicious when made with a true speculoos spice blend. I suggest you to try the spice blend below in your own speculoos recipe. In On Baking 3, a good recipe for speculoos cookies is found on page 341.
Assembly 
1. Prepare ladyfingers
2. Prepare moistening syrup, when cooled moisten ladyfinger cake and place in glasses /rings/molds
3. Prepare mascarpone cream and fill glasses alternating with moistened ladyfinger cake.
4. Decorate with speculoos cookies/chocolate/sugared and toasted almonds and cocoa powder
 
Mascarpone cream for Tiramisu
Yield: 10-12 servings










8
Egg yolks
8



4 oz
Water
120 ml



6 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
180 g



4
Gelatin leaves (optional*)
4



16 oz
Mascarpone cheese
480 g



2 tsp
Vanilla extract (Optional)
10 ml



12 oz
Heavy cream
360 g







































If using this cream to fill in verrines (glasses) gelatin can be omitted.

Place gelatin leaves in very cold water and set aside.
In a cold bowl whisk heavy cream to very soft ribbon consistency. Absolutely do not whip to a peak! Set aside.
Fill a saucepan with a small amount of water and bring to a boil and then turn to a low simmer.  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks and measured water. Add sugar and whisk well. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the yolk mixture reaches at least 165°F (74°C). Remove from heat.
Remove the gelatin leaves from the water and squeeze well to remove excess water. Whisk the gelatin into the yolk mixture. Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and whisk smooth.
Add the soft whipped heavy cream and gently fold into the above using a spatula. Fill into the mold immediately.

Speculoos Spices (My uncle’s blend)



1 oz
Cinnamon
30 g


0.25 oz
Cloves, ground
6 g


0.33 oz
Ginger, ground
7.5 g


0.33 oz
Cardamom
7.5 g


0.12 oz
White pepper
4         g



 

Combine ingredients and store airtight.

 
 
1.            Set oven at 420°F (210°C).
2.            Prepare 1 baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. If piping the ladyfingers prepare a piping bag fitted with a baking tip slightly smaller than ½ inch (1 cm).
3.            Sift flour and spices twice and set aside.
4.            Whip egg yolks and vanilla on high until a thick ribbon forms and the color is pale, at least 8 minutes. Set aside.
5.            In a separate and immaculately clean bowl whip egg whites and sugar to a very stiff consistency (as seen in the picture). Remove from machine.
6.            With a spatula stir the meringue around to make it smooth and homogenous. (Since they do not contain flour or egg yolk yet, they will not fall)
7.            Quickly scrape the whipped yolks to the meringue and fold gently with a spatula until almost completely mixed together. Some yellow streaks may remain.
8.            Gently fold the sifted flour into the mixture taking care not to overfold.
9.            Place in the piping bag and pipe into long fingers or spread evenly onto two baking sheets.
10.            Dust with powdered sugar and let sit for a minute. Dust a second time and place in the oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
