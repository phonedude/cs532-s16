<title>Ginger Ice Cream</title>

Although ginger is used in the savory kitchen year round, it seems that most of us in the pastry kitchen (especially in the West) use it mainly during the fall and winter season.  One of the things that I like about ginger is that it can be very effective in creating an aura of excellence to desserts. Another reason is that ginger does wonders for the digestion system, which makes it a natural good choice for desserts. Ginger pairs very well with citrus and candied kumquat or candied orange peel are very good choices to incorporate into this ice cream dessert.
Once the ice cream is churned spread it into pre-chilled molds or rectangular mousse frames and layer with candied citrus and broken nougatine pieces. Allow to freeze 12 hours before unmolding and decorating.
