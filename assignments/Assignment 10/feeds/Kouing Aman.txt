<title>Kouing Aman</title>
<description>

It is fair to say that most people find a perfect pure butter croissant or a delectable apple turnover simply irresistible. It is partly about the texture, the buttery flakes, the aroma and the desire for more.  Like nearly everyone, I am also a huge aficionado of Palmiers. To me, Palmiers caramelized crust and its buttery crisp layers are nothing less than a feast for the mouth.
Kouing Aman is a little of all of the above. It can be described as a crisp caramelized shell with flakey tender buttery layers with a most satisfying flavor.

For laminating dough in school we use a machine, but for a “how to roll by hand session” I have found that Kouing Aman is a perfect candidate. This because it does not have to be (although it can) as perfectly rolled as let’s say puff pastry.
Getting It All Together!
From start to finish it is best to allow about 6 hours to prepare  Kouing Aman.
