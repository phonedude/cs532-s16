<title>Lemon Sorbet | Lemon Rose Geranium Sorbet</title>
<description>

Few desserts refresh and excite our taste buds as lemon sorbet.  Lemon is wonderful when paired within the citrus family but can be equally as delicious when harmonized with black or red currant, edible geranium, ginger, apricot, milk chocolate and others.  Ginger, edible geranium and other flowers or herbs are simply extracted into the sorbet base syrup.  All citrus including lemon and lime are always best when freshly squeezed.
Sometimes the difference between sorbet and sherbet are not clearly understood. It basically lies in dairy products, sorbet does not contain milk or cream while sherbet does.
When I make sorbet as a plated dessert I often keep the other components low or completely free of fat as well. I do this mainly because I believe that when people choose sorbet as their dessert choice, they oftentimes seek something easy and light to digest. On this plate in addition to the lemon sorbet I added apricot pate de fruit and a strip of Italian Meringue.

Pour water in a saucepan. Sift together the sugar and stabilizer (If using) and whisk into the water. Add the invert sugar and bring to a full boil.
Add the rose geranium (if using) and cover with plastic film and allow the syrup to mature for 12-24 hours. (Maturing the syrup will result in a smoother sorbet which will develop fewer ice crystals during storing).
Strain the syrup and add the lemon juice, churn according to your machine.
Spread the sorbet on a pre-chilled and plastic lined hotel pan to desired depth.
Freeze until hard and cut into desired shapes.
Place on a plate and serve with apricot pate de fruit and a strip of Italian Meringue. Torch the meringue and serve.
