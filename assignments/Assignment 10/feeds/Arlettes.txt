<title>Arlettes</title>
<description>

One of the things I like to prepare with leftover puff pastry trimmings are arlettes. Their lightness pairs perfectly with gelato, sorbet or a good fruit soup/plate. While I am writing this, I have arlettes by my side but no gelato or sorbet, only good espresso, and I must say it is quite delicious as well.
Oftentimes I prepare arlettes without any additional flavors, where only the butter and caramel flavor takes the forefront. But I do like these when made with cardamom and lemon, flavors I find most irresistible when paired with butter and caramel notes.
Getting It All Together!
Although you can use newly prepared puff pastry, chilled leftover trimmings will do fine.

Roll the puff pastry into a rectangle 12 inches (30 cm) wide.  Brush with a thin layer      of melted butter and sprinkle with lemon zest. Roll into a spiral.
Place in a freezer for      approximately 45 minutes or until firm enough to slice in even slices.
Slice using a knife or      use an electric meat slicer ¼ inch (0.5 cm) thick. Place in a      refrigerator.
Sift the amount of extra      fine granulated sugar selected with 1.5 % ground cardamom. Ensure a good      distribution of the cardamom.
Place the slices into      the sugar and roll 1/16 inch (2 mm) thick.
Place on parchment or      Silpat lined sheet pans and bake at 400°F (200°C) until the bottom side      has caramelized. Flip over and bake until both sides are well baked.
When cool, store      airtight.
