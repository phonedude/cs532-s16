<title>Corn Syrup Free Pecan Pie</title>
<description>

For some time now I have wanted to write another article on pecan pie which is one of the most beloved desserts in the United States. Just like brownies it is a dessert which is gaining popularity worldwide. In America, many of our customers believe that pecan pies have to be made with corn syrup, not knowing that the original pecan pies were actually made with brown sugar. In the early 20th century less expensive corn syrup started to replace brown sugar and became the custom for pecan pies.
Several years ago, I started working on a corn syrup free pecan pie recipe because I felt that corn syrup versions were too sweet and the flavor was never “clear”. Since then I have been making pecan pies with brown sugar with excellent results and an unsurpassed flavor which I believe will be loved by your customers as well.

Although this recipe works perfect as is, for this particular pecan pie I have added some dark chocolate which further cuts the sweetness.  Pecans do like the company of Dark Rum, Cognac or Brandy and I do recommend adding some.  Most often pecan pies are made using standard pie dough (pâte brisée) but there is something to be said for using sweet tart dough (pate sucrée) instead. A prebaked sweet tart dough shell ensures a well baked crust which can be hard to achieve when using standard pie dough and rack ovens.
 
Pecan pie without corn syrup
Yield: 2 – 9 inch pies










 










6
Large eggs
6



12 oz
Water
240 g



1 lb 12 oz
Medium brown sugar
840 g


 
1 tsp
Salt
5 g



4 oz
Butter, melted
120 g









1 oz
Dark Rum, Cognac or Brandy
30 g



1 tbsp
Vanilla extract
15 g



1 lb
Pecan halves
480 g














 
4 oz
Chocolate (58-64% cocoa   mass)
120 g


 
 
 
 



 

Line 2 pie tins with sweet tart dough and prebake. Alternatively use pie dough (pâte brisée) and do not prebake.
Whisk together the eggs and water until smooth. Add brown sugar, salt, butter, liquor and vanilla extract.
Chop less than half of the pecans in small pieces and scatter in the pie shells along with the chocolate.  Fill with the filling about half full. The pecan pieces will automatically float.
Arrange the pecan halves in a circular fashion above the floating pecan pieces.
Carefully drizzle the remaining filling over the pecan halves.
For a pie made with sweet tart dough place in a 325°F (160°C) oven and bake until the center is set, about 65 minutes total. For pies made with standard pie dough place the pies in a 400°F (200°C) oven for 10 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C), bake until the center is set.
