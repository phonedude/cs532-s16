<title>Candied Buddha’s Hand</title>
<description>

One of the most interesting looking fruits in our world is without a doubt Buddha’s hand or fingered citron. By now you probably know that I have not met a citrus that I do not like and Buddha’s hand is no exception.  Every year when these fruits become available I have an irresistible urge to incorporate them in desserts. The exquisite aromatic citrus along with a hint of Jasmine is a combination which is hard to resist. At times I will place one on our dinner table and skip the flowers.  In China, Buddha’s hand symbolizes long life and happiness. In Japan people will often bring a Buddha’s hand to people’s homes on New Years, as it is believed to present good fortune.  In our home it is a fruit I love to have as it very elegantly perfumes the air.

The interior flesh is spongy and very similar like the white pitch from other citrus but this one has absolutely no traces of bitterness. The fruit itself does not contain juice, so it does limit us in ways to use this fruit.   One of the things I prepare often with Buddha hand is a marmalade which I slightly dilute with Cointreau and serve with croissants or scones. It is very delicious.  Candying Buddha’s hand is also a great way to use this fruit, since it allows us to incorporate it in many ways.

Getting It All Together!
To candy Buddha’s hand, I prefer to remove a good amount of the white spongy part, not that it is bitter, I just prefer the peel more. Candied it will last for many weeks kept in the candying syrup in a refrigerator.
