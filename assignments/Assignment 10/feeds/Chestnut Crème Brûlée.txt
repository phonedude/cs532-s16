One of the most beautiful trees on earth is without a doubt the chestnut tree.  Sadly, in North America 4 billion chestnut trees were killed by fungus in the 1900’s, which is just one reason why chestnut desserts are hard to find on dessert menus.
Using fresh chestnuts is for many pastry chefs something which is too labor intensive. However, frozen I.Q.F. (individual quick frozen) chestnuts as well as chestnut puree is readily available.
The crème brûlée below is formulated using non sweetened chestnuts, if using sweetened puree reduce the sugar content in this recipe. When selecting fresh chestnuts ensure that the skin feels tight to the meat. Aromatize chestnut desserts with Vanilla, chestnut liquor or Cognac.
