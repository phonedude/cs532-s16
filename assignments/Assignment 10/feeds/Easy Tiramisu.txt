When preparing desserts for huge events, having enough equipment can be an issue. Who has, let’s say 800 individual rings handy? Therefore I like to teach students ways of using ordinary equipment and yet, still obtaining stylish results. One example is featured here. A standard American type sheet pan is used to obtain this dessert. First thin ladyfinger batter was spread onto a sheet pan and baked. Once cooled and released is was placed on a plastic food film lined sheet pan. Moistened with coffee syrup and then topped with mascarpone cream. After freezing it was released from the pan and cut into rectangle sized shapes.

*If using this cream to fill in verrines (glasses) gelatin can be omitted.

Place gelatin leaves in very cold water and set aside.
In a cold bowl whisk heavy cream to very soft, barely a ribbon consistency. Over-whipping will result in poor results. Set aside.
Fill a saucepan with a small amount of water and bring to a boil and then turn to a low simmer.  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks and measured water. Add sugar and whisk well. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the yolk mixture reaches at least 165°F (74°C). Remove from heat.
Remove the gelatin leaves from the water and squeeze well to remove excess water. Whisk the gelatin into the yolk mixture. Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and whisk smooth.
Add the soft whipped heavy cream and gently fold into the above using a spatula. Fill into the mold immediately.
