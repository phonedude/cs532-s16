<title>Artisanal Belgian Chocolate Truffles</title>
<description>

Truffles can be made either by using heavy cream, chocolate and a sweetener or are made with butter, chocolate and a sweetener. Both can be delicious and have their own distinct characteristic. If you desire to make truffles with well pronounced flavor (from liquor, extracts, tea, coffee etc) then butter based truffles may be a good choice. The creamed butter mixture, which is consequently light and airy makes it possible for flavors to really shine through, which can be a challenge when using bitter chocolate.
These truffles are flavored with homemade coffee extract and sprinkled with nougatine.

Mix butter until creamy, add invert sugar and cream more.
Melt first listed dark and milk chocolate to 95°F (34°C) and at this temperature to creamed butter. Mix well and add coffee extract and liquor and mix until combined.
Let mixture set for approximately 30 minutes or until crystallization starts to take place.
Pipe into even mounds. Sprinkle with very thin rolled pieces of nougatine. Do not place the truffles in a refrigerator. Let set in a cool area until fully crystallized, about 2 hours.
Temper couverture chocolate as shown on this site and dip truffles, drop onto quality cocoa powder.
Carefully roll the dipped truffles into cocoa powder ensuring not to stick the fork into the truffle itself.
When firm shake off extra cocoa powder and place in a refrigerator. Serve at room temperature for full flavor experience.
