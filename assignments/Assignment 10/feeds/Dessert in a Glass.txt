Cherries topped with chocolate Port sauce and hazelnut streusel
One of the things I like about serving a dessert in a glass or verrine is that no special equipment is needed. All you basically need is a modern style glass and you are set to go to make a contemporary dessert. The other and most important reason is that a glass allows options which may not be possible if the dessert is made other than in a glass. Take for example mousses and creams of all kinds, if made into molds these usually will need a higher amount of setting agent (gelatin, chocolate, cocoa butter, agar, eggs etc) compared to a cream destined to go directly in a glass.  Softer creams are always more wonderful on the palate, no one can argue with that.

For this dessert I covered the cherries with a delicious chocolate Port sauce. Cherries pair wonderfully with chocolate and the Port enhances and deepens the flavor of the cherries beautifully. Something else that works perfectly with cherries is hazelnuts and therefore the cherries are topped with hazelnut streusel. For the vanilla cream I selected a Panna cotta flavored with Kirsch liquor but a Bavarian cream or a vanilla gelato would be just great as well.
Getting It All Together!
Panna cotta can easily be made a day ahead and kept in the refrigerator. The chocolate port sauce will last for at least a week in a refrigerator and the streusel can be frozen unbaked. Simply bake what you need.
