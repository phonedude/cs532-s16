<title>Fruit tarts</title>
<description>

A good tart shell, good cream and good fruit make one delicious dessert.  Although good hazelnut dough can be very delicious for a fruit tart, my favorite dough remains coconut shortbread tart dough.  It is one I use for lime and lemon tarts and certain petit four.
It has been my experience that many people in the United States are only mildly impressed with pastry cream, therefore for most tarts, I select either a cremeux or a cream flavored with fruit purees. For this particular mixed fruit tarts I used the refreshing and always delicious passion fruit cream.
