<title>Port Chocolate Pecan Tart</title>
<description>

A common criticism of pecan pie is that it can be sweet, too sweet in fact. However, it does not necessarily have to be that way. If you start by making pecan pie without high fructose corn syrup, you will automatically cut down the high levels of sweetness.  It is a common belief by many people that pecan pie can only be made with corn syrup.  However that is not true, it has been my experience that pecan pies made without corn syrup taste far superior.
For the pecan tart featured here, I decreased the sweetness level even further. Using smooth and good quality Port (Porto) made this possible.  Premium Port has complex flavor notes which harmonize excellent with pecans. Adding a small amount of chocolate enhances this complexity even more.

 
 
 
Port Chocolate pecan Pie




3
eggs
3



6 oz
Port (Fonseca)
180 g



14 oz
Light or brown sugar
420 g



½ teaspoon
salt
2.5 g



4 oz
Butter, melted
120 g





















1 teaspoon
Vanilla
5 g



8 oz
Pecan halves
240 g









2 oz
Chocolate, 60 % cocoa, in pieces
60 g



 
Line a 24 cm (9.5 inch) wide and 3.2 cm (1.25 inch) high tart pan with sweet tart dough (pate sucrée) and prebake until golden. Brush with egg wash and return briefly to oven. Set aside.

Whisk eggs and Port until combined. Add brown sugar and salt. Add melted butter and vanilla.
Chop half of pecans in small pieces and scatter onto bottom of tart pan. Scatter in chocolate.
Gently pour filling into tart pan about half full. Onto floating pecans pieces arrange pecan halves in a circular fashion starting on edges and working towards center.
In a drizzle fashion pour remaining filling over pecans. Try to cover each and every single pecan.
Place in 160°C (325°F) oven and bake until center is set. If center is rising the tart has slightly been over baked.
