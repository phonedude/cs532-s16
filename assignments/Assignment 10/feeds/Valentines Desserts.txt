<title>Valentines Desserts</title>
<description>

Oftentimes Valentines desserts are shared and therefore I prefer flavors which will be adored by both love birds. Consequently a chocolate foie gras filled Mille feuille may not be the best choice here. If this particular dessert does not work for you check out the links below to my site for additional Valentine dessert options.
