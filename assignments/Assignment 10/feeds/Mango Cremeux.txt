<title>Mango Cremeux</title>
<description>

Key to any good dessert is balance of ingredients. Using too much of any component can make any dessert unpleasant to eat. Unless of course if you particularly love a certain component. Take for example this individual Mango tart. The ratio of this light and delicate Breton Shortbread is rather high to the ratio of the Mango cremeux. Some will feel that the balance is lovely while others may prefer more cremeux. Neither is particularly wrong, it is a matter of personal preference. What we certainly all can agree on is that an overly thick and hard tart crust is always unpleasant.
What is nice about this dessert is that it is rather quick to make. The Breton shortbread is pressed or piped into silforms and baked. Once baked and cooled they can be filled with a variety of fillings.


Getting It All Together!
The Breton Shortbread is best baked the day of serving. Certainly the filled silforms can be frozen and defrosted later for bake off. The mango cremeux can be made a day in advance and right before using being mixed using an immersion blender or high speed blender for optimum smoothness.
