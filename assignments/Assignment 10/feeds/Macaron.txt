<title>Macaron</title>
<description>

A fruit which never seems to escape my interest are cranberries. I adore them in savory applications as well as in desserts.  Their acidic bitterness is particularly welcome in desserts which are by nature sweet and are in dire need of a touch of balance. Think for example of wonderful baked meringue layered with cranberry marmalade and crème Chantilly. It’s a composition I often make for our guest since it is a house favorite.

This Holiday season I decided to fill some of my macarons with a cranberry ganache.  At times I make this specific ganache without any cream, however it is slightly smoother with the cream, so this is the one I share with you today. If you decide to use this ganache as a soft filling for something that will be refrigerated, I suggest reducing the chocolate by 30%. Cranberries are loaded with natural pectin and the ganache will set with very little chocolate. The amount of sugar seems rather high, but it is correct, cranberries are indeed very bitter and require a good amount of sugar.
Getting it all together!
Gerbet Macaron can easily be filled a day ahead of serving. In fact it allows the filling to make the center of the macaron extra tender.  Prepare the ganache a day ahead of using to ensure proper crystallization.

Bring the cranberries, whipping cream and sugar to a boil. Remove from heat and blend to a super smooth puree. If seeds remain, strain to remove. Return to heat and boil for 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and pour onto the chocolate in 3 increments. Stirring with a spatula to obtain a perfect emulsion. Cover and store at room temperature. Use the next day.

Note: See above article on reducing amount of chocolate in this ganache.
