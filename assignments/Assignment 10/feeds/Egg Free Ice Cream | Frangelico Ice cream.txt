<title>Egg Free Ice Cream | Frangelico Ice cream</title>
<description>

In ice cream, egg yolks are used for their stabilizing ability as they bind water, resulting in frozen desserts with a rich mouth feel.  Large ice cream manufacturers often use gums in addition to, or instead of egg yolks. Gums allow hefty amounts of air incorporation during churning, increasing the volume of an ice cream base. Gums are also used to aid in the prevention of ice crystals formation in stored ice cream.
Although it may seem that eggs or gums are a positive ingredient in ice cream making, they do have a negative aspect. For example, egg yolk adds (unwanted) flavor to ice creams and gums, “coat” our taste buds. The “coating” makes it harder for our taste buds to fully experience flavor.  Also, ice creams made with gums will feel less cold, intense and vibrant in the mouth.
Preparing smooth, non icy and luxurious Ice cream without egg yolk and without stabilizers is possible. Good to know since millions of people cannot eat or are allergic to eggs. May I suggest you give this a try? Chances are that you will be amazed with the result.
