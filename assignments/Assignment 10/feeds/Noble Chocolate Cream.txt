<title>Noble Chocolate Cream</title>
<description>

Noble chocolate cream is a cousin of chocolate cremeux but made without egg yolk. Another difference is that it contains higher amount of milk than whipping cream, this allows the chocolate flavor to be fully pronounced. (High fat content has a tendency to masks flavors) Since no eggs are present and a smaller amount of cream is used, the gelatin is slightly increased. However this cream is not firm or gelatinous, instead it is silky, luxurious and superbly creamy without carrying an overly rich feeling.
For this cream I recommend using chocolate with cocoa mass content in the mid 50 range with a deep and well pronounced chocolate flavor.
For our Patisserie student readers: A higher amount of cocoamass does not necessarily equal a stronger chocolate flavor. Chocolate flavor intensity will rely on several factors such as the cocoa butter content, roasting of the beans and more. (Think of coffee beans, one brand will make rich tasting coffee while another brand will be mild).
Since this cream does not contain eggs or cream which is whipped, it is a prime candidate to compare chocolate brands and how well they perform  in terms of residual chocolate flavor.  Use different brands of chocolate containing identical cocoa mass may reveal surprising results. Often, what is superior in terms of tasting it as pure chocolate may leave a less pronounced flavor as a finished product.
Note: If the Noble cream develops a firmer set than desired, reduce the amount of gelatin. Not all chocolate will result in the the same setting.
