<title>Marshmallow | Raspberry</title>
<description>
 

The entire meringue family is very intriguing to me. Whether it is baked French style meringue layered into an entremet or an Italian Style meringue, frosted onto an ice cream cake, I am captivated by its versatility. Meringue is very adaptable indeed. Take for example Italian Meringue, used in mousses for creating an unequaled richness without adding fat, or used for piping onto countless desserts. When we simply add gelatin to Italian Meringue we have a confection popular the world over named marshmallow. Many people appreciate well made marshmallow, it’s delicate and light and at the same it time feels very rich and decadent on the human tongue.
Making confections with marshmallow and incorporating it into certain desserts is something I am very fond of. However, it is important to cut the sweetness of the marshmallow somehow.  This can easily be achieved by dipping it into chocolate which happens to be a sublime complement.
The raspberry marshmallows featured here are placed on a prebaked chocolate sablée square which adds a delicious texture. To ensure that the raspberry flavor is not overshadowed by the chocolate, it is dipped in chocolate couverture containing 58% cocoa mass.
