<title>Swiss Style Carrot Cake</title>
<description>

There is something to be said for classic or traditional cakes. Who does not appreciate the comfort and enduring good flavor of a traditional carrot cake? It is fair to say that classic cakes become classic, simply because they stand the test of time due to their flavor and texture balance.
I have made all types of carrot cakes, some iced with traditional cream cheese icing, others topped with mascarpone cream and lots of poached pineapple, carrot cake as a pound cake, Swiss style carrot cake…. When properly made they are all delicious.
For a plated dessert version of carrot cake I like to get almond or hazelnut flour in the mix. Both of these nut flours bring an unsurpassed flavor and finesse to carrot cake. Using almond or hazelnut flour is not necessarily a new concept, in Swiss style carrot cakes (Aargauer Rublitorte) it is the norm. To give carrot cake a contemporary feel I may use silicone ware or simply make it in a sheet. Once baked, I cut the cake in a desired shape to lend a new feel to classic carrot cake.

Getting it all together!
Ice the carrot cake either with a cream cheese or mascarpone frosting or with a mascarpone cream. All versions are very good, it is just a matter of personal taste.
The carrot strips can be made a week in advance as they remain excellent when well packaged. These strips are very delicious and allow a fresh and contemporary look to a carrot cake. In “On Baking” we showcase the carrot strips on a traditional American style carrot cake.
Serve this cake with either a carrot-mango sorbet or mascarpone ice cream.
