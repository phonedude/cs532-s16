<title>Homemade Coconut Milk</title>
<description>

It is not easy to find good quality coconut milk which provides consistent results and has an excellent coconut flavor.  Some canned coconut milks are very fatty or thick, others are very liquid without much flavor. Coconut milk can also be prohibitive expensive for use in coconut cream pies or other common preparations.  Our vendors do sell coconut extract, which some is natural and some artificial, however most extracts make me think of sun tan lotion rather than real coconut.
Making your own coconut milk is very easy and provides a natural flavor. Standard dairy milk is what I usually use, but for specialty diets, soy, almond, flax seed milk and others will work just the same. If you need whipping cream with a coconut flavor use the same method as the recipe below. Although a fuller flavor will be obtained when using regular milk versus a high fat containing cream. For a toasted coconut flavor in your gelato, panna cotta, ice creams etc, simply toast the coconut first.
Since coconut is sold in many versions in the world and to prevent confusion, the coconut to look for is what most of us already have in our pastry lab: Unsweetened desiccated or unsweetened finely shredded coconut.
