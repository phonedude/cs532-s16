<title>Hazelnut shortbread</title>
<description>

For certain events a professional pastry chef is often faced with having to prepare bite size cookies which are attractive looking and at the same time delicious. Shortbread is usually a good candidate for such instance since they have an undeniable elegance about them.
The shortbread featured here is in many places in the world called a petit four sec.  Dipping the shortbread in crystallized chocolate is optional but it is something I prefer to do since it elevates something which is rather simple to something exceptional.
Getting it all together!
Unbaked shortbread freezes very well and thus can easily be made in advance. Once baked it is best the day it is made. However, when well packaged it does last several days.  You can certainly dip the entire shortbread in chocolate and thus extending the shelf life even further.


Hazelnut shortbread
Note: Protein or gluten content varies in flour, even within a specific type and thus has an effect on the final texture. Since shortbread is all about the texture it may be necessary to slightly adjust the amount of flour and or replace part of the flour with corn starch.
