<title>Orange Ganache Tarts</title>
<description>

Whenever I make chocolate ganache tarts I am always afraid that they will be too rich. I always strive to reach a good balance in desserts and sometimes, I feel that ganache tarts can be over the top heavy. One way I like to cut the richness in ganache, is to replace part of the whipping cream with a fruit puree or juice. Not only can this provide an excellent flavor, but it can also add certain finesse. Some fruit purees naturally enhance the fruitiness of chocolate and really bring complexity of flavor.
In this particular instant I replaced part of the cream with concentrated orange juice. Concentrated orange juice? Sure, concentrated orange juice is made by means of using a vacuum and I prefer to use it over reducing orange juice. At times there exceptions! I do not recommend this ganache-as it is formulated, to be used as a large tart. The ganache is soft, even if refrigerated and these tarts are always best when removed from the refrigerator 45 minutes before being served. Thus cutting a large tart and hoping to obtain perfect slices may not become a reality.

These particular tarts were served at a dinner party we recently had and we served it with Clementine (used fresh juice!) and Mandarin Napoleon sorbet. Along with the sorbet, the richness of the tarts was tamed and it just became a luxurious dessert that everyone loved.
Getting It All Together!
The chocolate tart dough can be made weeks in advance and be stored in the freezer. Bake the tart shells the day of serving for optimum results. The ganache is best prepared fresh as it will be silky smooth. The recipe for the chocolate tart dough is in On Baking on page 390.
