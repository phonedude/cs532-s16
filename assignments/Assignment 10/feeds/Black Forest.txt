<title>Black Forest</title>
<description>

Whether cream, chocolate, Kirsch and cherries are composed into a frozen dessert or plated (as shown here) they always please. Throughout my work, I have always been interested in discovering new flavor combinations, but at the same time I have always carefully studied the classics to discover what made them enduring.

 
Some fruits can even be more delicious when heated or sautéed and cherries belong exactly to this family. Flambéed cherries on gelato or served with panna cotta is simply perfection.
When I select a type of chocolate cake for black forest I make sure that it can be properly moistened with Kirsch liquor syrup.  Certainly a chocolate genoise or a sponge cake can be used but using a chocolate cake rich in almonds add more finesse.
Assembly

Cut a piece of chocolate      cake into a desired shape. Moisten well with the Kirsch syrup.
Place a piece of panna      cotta on the cake and serve with flambéed cherries.
