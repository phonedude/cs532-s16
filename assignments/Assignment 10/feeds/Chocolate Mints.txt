There is something to be said to have chocolates in your repertoire which hold a long shelf life. It can make your work schedule a lot easier since you can make these types of chocolates well in advance of busy holidays.   One type of filling which will certainly keep fresh for at least 6 months is a Confiserie fondant type. Often used in economy chocolate selections since it is an inexpensive type of filling with the additional benefit of long conservation.  They are frequently flavored with liquors and or flavoring compounds to mask its sweetness and of course to give flavor.  Using chocolate with higher cocoa mass content is another way to balance the high sugariness.  Fondant type of fillings tend to work best in rather low depth chocolate molds where it is easier to achieve a good balance between the sweet filling and bittersweet chocolate.
Confiserie fondant mixed with peppermint oil is a classic and well liked in many parts of our world.  The cooling sensation of peppermint combined with good bittersweet chocolate is a delicious pleasure indeed.  Few of us make our own confiserie fondant but for our pastry students who cannot readily purchase this fondant you can find the recipe on my site here.

 Line chocolate molds with tempered chocolate and place upside down in a refrigerator until the chocolate starts to contract.
 Warm fondant in a microwave oven to 85F (cccccccccc) add peppermint oil or extract to taste. Add a very small amount of water or liquor to bring to a thick but pipeable consistency.  Keep well covered to prevent a skin from forming.
 Fill the molds 2 mm from edge.  If desired sprinkle with cocoa nibs. Allow the fondant to “crust”.
