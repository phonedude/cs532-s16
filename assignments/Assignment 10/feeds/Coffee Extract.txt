<title>Coffee Extract</title>
<description>

Most would agree that the aroma of high quality coffee is simply magnificent. Even people who are not fond of drinking coffee tend to like its scent.  Desserts made with coffee extract have an aura of luxury with at the same time being uplifting. Too bad that so many of the coffee extracts available on the market today, taste more like burnt caramel than actual coffee.
To make your own you coffee extract you will need good quality coffee, some artisan coffee merchants make outstanding coffee and then certainly some large companies do as well. There is an amazing Belgian coffee which is rather difficult to purchase in many parts of the world and another favorite of mine is Italian Kimbo, Gold Espresso.  These coffees (Or others, I assume there some good ones in your area) will make great tasting homemade coffee extract which will flavor your desserts to a higher level.
