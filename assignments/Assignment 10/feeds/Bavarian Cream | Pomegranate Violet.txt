<title>Bavarian Cream | Pomegranate Violet</title>
<description>

To me, the beginning of the Fall season is always wonderful. Outdoor temperatures are simply amazing and fruits we have not seen for a while, suddenly appear in our markets.  One fruit that always catches my attention are pomegranates. Their sweet tart flavor is something that I treasure very much and consequently I use pomegranates in countless desserts.  The beautiful red arils can be striking on petit fours or fruit tarts containing other red fruits.

One of my favorite flavor combinations with pomegranate is violet (Violette). The essence of violet can be tricky to find in many places in the world, but luckily violet liqueur is much easier to come by. It adds a delicious floral taste to red fruits such as raspberries or strawberries without making these soapy. Since Bavarian cream is pretty much neutral in flavor it is an excellent candidate to be aromatized by violet and thus pair beautifully with pomegranate.

Assembly:
Prepare the Breton shortbread and set aside. Prepare the Bavarian cream and pour the cream half full into silicone domes. Sprinkle pomegranate arils in the center. Fill with additional Bavarian cream and top with a baked Breton shortbread. Freeze until firm. Unmold and allow to defrost. Serve with the raspberry violet coulis.
