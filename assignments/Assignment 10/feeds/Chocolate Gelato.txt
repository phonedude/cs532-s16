<title>Chocolate Gelato</title>
<description>

In most parts of the world vanilla is the most sold ice cream flavor and chocolate second.  Indeed a very good reason to have chocolate gelato in your dessert repertoire. If you open our freezer at home, you will usually find chocolate and pistachio gelato.
For chocolate gelato I prefer not to use egg yolks as these can hinder the pure and true chocolate flavor.  However, when you do not use egg yolks, an ice cream stabilizer is needed to ensure a smooth emulsion. In chocolate gelato and many of my other chocolate preparations, I use a small amount of coffee extract to enhance the chocolate flavor.  It is no secret that all chocolate manufactures use either real or artificial vanilla extract in their chocolate because it makes it more delicious. To make chocolate gelato I like to add vanilla (even though it is already present in the chocolate) to complete the flavor.
