Caramels are much desired the world over and can be made in many different flavors. While vanilla and chocolate are the most popular ones, coffee pairs exceptionally well with the buttery tones of caramel.
The coffee caramels can be wrapped in cellophane as shown in On Baking, or can be dipped in milk or dark chocolate couverture and finished with a touch of fleur de sel, if so desired.
