<title>Belgian Waffles</title>
<description>

Golden crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside with a near see thru appearance are the characteristics of a perfect waffle.
In Belgium, this type of waffle is known as the Brussels waffle where it is very popular. The Belgian or Brussels waffle was first introduced in 1856 at the fair in Brussels, although other types of waffles had been around for a much longer time.  In fact a waffle iron can be seen on a painting by Pieter Breughel, dating back to 1559.

Traditionally waffles in Belgium are consumed as a dessert and served with powdered sugar, whipped cream, butter, ice cream, chocolate sauce, fruits etc. In the United States most people consume waffles for breakfast. In our home we serve waffles both for weekend breakfast (piled with lots of fresh fruit) and for dessert.
Getting it all together!
Since yeast is involved with this type of waffle it takes time to for this batter to reach perfection, therefore, if you are planning to serve this type of waffle for breakfast it is best to make these during the day and simply freeze them. Defrosting is quick and once they come out of the toaster they are still very good. If you serve them for dessert or an afternoon snack make them fresh!
