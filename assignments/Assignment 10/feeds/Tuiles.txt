<title>Tuiles</title>
<description>

We all know that many plated desserts can go from ordinary to extraordinary by simply adding an eye catching tuile. It is the reason why so many of us use them in our work on a daily basis. Made round, square, into long strips, curved, left flat, rolled, the possibilities are nearly endless. Besides being placed on a plated dessert they also fit perfectly on a petit four platter and can be delicious when dipped in chocolate.
Tuiles suffer quickly when exposed to humidity and are therefore best made daily or packaged air tight with desiccant.  Personally, for even results I prefer to make tuiles using Flexipan since it allows for efficient work with excellent results.  Certainly Silpat can be used as well.
The recipe below is composed of lime and grapefruit juice but these juices can be replaced with passion fruit. Some tuiles can be a greasy upon removal from the oven but these are well balanced and do not require pectin or glucose. For the students out there, tuiles need to be scaled exact to ensure a lacy texture.

Cream the butter and add powdered sugar and salt. Cream until light.
Gradually add the fruit juices.
Blend in the flour. Allow to mature for 1 hour before baking or overnight in a refrigerator.
Pipe small amount s of the batter into Flexipan or onto Silpat. If desired place a slice of candied kumquat onto the batter and bake in a 350°F (180°C) oven until light golden.
For shaped tuiles remove from the pan and shape into desired forms. For flat tuiles allow to cool in pan.
Once cooled store airtight with a desiccant.
