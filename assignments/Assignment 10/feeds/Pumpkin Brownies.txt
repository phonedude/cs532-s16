<title>Pumpkin Brownies</title>
<description>

The combination of pumpkin and chocolate may be unusual, however it is rather a delicious one. If you want to serve pumpkin brownies as a plated dessert, consider a mandarin sorbet. Oftentimes I am asked if I use fresh pumpkins instead of canned, but I do not. I prefer canned pumpkin as it provides consistent and very good results.
Since the pumpkin part of this brownie provides a good amount of creaminess, I choose a brownie batter formulated with cocoa powder as it creates a less fudgy brownie.
