One of the most luxurious ice cream or gelato is without a doubt pistachio. Irresistible when combined with chocolate, strawberries, apricots ….
You certainly can turn this into gelato and replace whipping cream with an equal amount of milk. Doing so will bring out a more pronounced pistachio flavor but the reduction of fat will in turn decrease   conservation. (Not a problem if consumed say day as it was churned) Either way, use the amount of pistachios as indicated in this recipe to obtain a most wonderful texture and flavor.
