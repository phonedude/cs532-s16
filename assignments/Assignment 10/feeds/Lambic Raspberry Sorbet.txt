<title>Lambic Raspberry Sorbet</title>
<description>

This past summer Lieve Blancquaert and her amazing crew came to Houston and filmed me nonstop for 4 days for an episode of her beautiful documentary, titled “Made in Belgium”. It’s a series of 8 shows, each featuring a chef who works somewhere in the world. Her program took her to South America, Africa, North America and Europe. The show truly is a work of art, not only is it brilliantly presented and filmed, it also shows an in depth view of the work and life of the particular chef featured. It is the type of quality television we all wished we had more off.
During the week of filming it seems like we had a thousand activities planned which kept me very busy and left me pretty much exhausted by the end of the week. Lieve is the type of person you just want to give your all, her skillful way of interviewing combined with her down to earth manner makes it just so. One of the perks I enjoyed was to see her at work when she was photographing people in extraordinary settings. Besides doing television work, Lieve is a magnificent award winning photographer whose work is sought after the world over.
For the “Made in Belgium” show they filmed a segment where we had friends over for dinner at our home and what better to serve than famous Belgian beef stew cooked in Belgian beer? For dessert I made a sorbet made from one of my top favorite beers “Lambic Framboise” A marvelous quality raspberry beer with a gorgeous bouquet made since….1559! I simply love the fact that this beer is available here in the America. Some people may not be aware of the fact that fruits and vegetables were used to make beers long before hops came into play.
Since I receive countless requests on how to make chocolate decorations here is one example. If you are a novice in chocolate work, I suggest you use dark couverture chocolate. It is a little easier to work with and is stronger. Make sure you read some of my articles on how to temper or crystallize chocolate here or consult “On Baking”. Use a pastry comb or adhesive spreader from the hardware store to “comb” the tempered chocolate onto acetate plastic.
Cheers!

Using a pastry comb, comb the tempered chocolate onto firm acetate plastic  into lines.


Bend the acetate and connect the ends with adhesive tape. Let sit for 5 minutes at room temperature and than place in a cool room or refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Carefully remove the adhesive tape and release the obtained chocolate rings. Place in a pattern of choice.

Pipe tempered chocolate in the center of the decoration (Not shown) to connect all the loops. Place a round chocolate cutout in the center to beautify.
