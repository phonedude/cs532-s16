<title>Inverse Puff Pastry</title>
<description>

Pastry Chefs have several options when it comes down to making Puff pastry and oftentimes will prepare the type which they are most familiar with or which they most prefer. Personally I have found that all types can produce excellent results when the procedure is properly followed. However based upon my research I do believe that puff pastry can differ in mouth feel. Some feel drier and some feel more buttery. Improperly made puff pastry can feel hard even though it is flaky. One thing for sure is that inverse puff pastry (Inversed or inverted puff pastry) bakes rather light and produces very flaky results. For filled applications such as apple turnovers or Pithivier I do prefer to use inverse puff pastry, reason being that it stands up real well to the steam/humidity produced from the fillings and consequently leaves virtually no traces of unbaked dough.
 
When preparing inverse puff pastry it is necessary to work in a cool kitchen. Instead of the butter block being wrapped by the dough it is enveloping it, thus a warm kitchen makes it nearly impossible to obtain good results. For the readers in the United States it is important to make this dough with butter labeled “European style” This type of butter contains less water and will produce better results. In other countries select butter with high fat content, this type of butter should also feel very firm in the refrigerator. Ghee or clarified butter is not recommended as some water is necessary to produce the flaky layers. Flour strengths differ around the world and thus additional flour may be needed to make the dough firm. Firm dough will create very flaky results.

In mixing bowl, fitted      with the paddle attachment mix the cold butter and bread flour (a) until      well combined. Dust a work surface with a small amount of flour and roll      the “Butter block dough” to a sheet pan size.  Cover with food wrap and place in a      refrigerator for 1 -2 hours.

Meanwhile using a dough      hook, knead the remaining ingredients until well combined, approximately 2      to 3 minutes.
Shape the dough into a      half sheet pan size and cover in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for one hour.
Place the dough      on the left side of the butter block.
Fold the right side of      the butter block over the dough and press on all sides to seal.
Place the dough with      the seamless side towards you and roll the dough in the lengthwise      direction 1/2” (1cm) thick.  Brush      off any excess flour.
Fold the dough in      thirds.

This completes a single turn.  Wrap in plastic and place in refrigerator for at least one hour.
