Of all the chocolates Mendiants are one of the easiest and fastest to make and are very much appreciated by our clients. Traditionally they are made with dark chocolate and a variety of nuts and candied fruits but the ones featured here are made with Valentines in mind.
Since many of our customers are not excited about white chocolate you may decide to add some additional flavoring to enhance it to your standards. For these I added vanilla bean to the white chocolate as it blends very well with the freeze dried strawberries, dried cherries, cranberries and macadamia nut.
Freeze dried strawberries will get soft when exposed to a refrigerator or high humidity. Packaging these is recommended.
