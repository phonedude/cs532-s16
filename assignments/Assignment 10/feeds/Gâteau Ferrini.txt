<title>Gâteau Ferrini</title>
<description>

Some of the finest cakes in the pastry shop oftentimes contain almonds. Just to name a few: Financier, Dacquoise, Pain de Genes, and Joconde…. Indeed they are some of a pastry chef most beloved cake layers to work with.  For this particular gâteau I used biscuit joconde as it allows me to moisten it with liquor syrup. Some cake layers such as Financier does not need moistening and dacquoise would be ruined if it was.

In this specific gateau, the multiple layers of Joconde moistened with Grand Marnier and layered with Ganache and grapefruit marmalade create a very fresh, slightly bitter and yet at the same time, a tender sweetness. At times, I like to serve this composition as a plated dessert accompanied by pink peppercorn chocolate sorbet and as a smaller version as Petit Four.



Getting It All Together!
The biscuit Joconde can be made days ahead and be frozen. At this time I am working on a recipe different than the one featured in On Baking, as soon as I have created a satisfactory result, I will publish it here. Not that I am not happy with the recipe featured in the book, it’s just that I cannot feature it on my site. Since American sheet pans are slightly larger than European ones I increased the ingredients for the Joconde recipe of On Baking by 20%.


Gâteau Ferrini
Yield: 3 gâteaux, each serving 6-8

Cut a full sheet joconde      crosswise into 4 equal strips. Moisten one strip with Grand Marnier syrup.
Spread a very thin layer      of grapefruit marmalade on the moistened layer. Cover with another strip      of joconde and moisten. Spread a thin layer of ganache on the surface.      Repeat the entire steps with joconde, grapefruit marmalade and ganache. Place in a      freezer.
Warm up a small amount of      Ganache to make it perfectly fluid, about 120°F (50°C ) pour onto the      surface to make it perfectly even. Cut into desired size.  Cover with sugared almonds and spray the      almonds with chocolate. Decorate as desired.

Bring to a boil the cream, sugar and invert sugar.
In a small bowl place the chocolate pistols or chocolate chopped in small pieces.
Pour the boiled mixture into the chocolate and using an immersion mixer (stick mixer) blend to a smooth mixture. Ensure to keep the mixer head completely submerged to prevent air being incorporated into the ganache.
Add the butter and blend smooth.

Note: Certainly the ganache can also be made by adding the cream in about 5 increments while stirring with a rubber spatula in a circular fashion.
