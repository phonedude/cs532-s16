<title>Quick Lime Curd</title>
<description>

 
For plated desserts I very much make sure that the various elements are not too scattered, preventing the consumer of having to “work” at the dessert (Ensuring that every bite has a good balance). Most of us like desserts which are multi layered with zero effort during the consumption. For example take an éclair. The perfect layering and understated elegance is the reason why I believe it is a classic worldwide. Desserts in a glass (or verrine) can be perfectly balanced as well and are also very easy to consume. The components consisting of a little crunch, something soft, something smooth, textures of fruit, a touch of sorbet, all coming together in one and all the consumer has to do is dig in with a spoon. Another major benefit to a dessert in a glass is that the creams, curds etc it contains, can be made with none or little gelatin or other thickeners. It’s fair to say that everyone prefers soft, creamy fillings over firmer gelatinized ones.
This lime curd is one of my personal favorites. It does not require a long cooking time over a double boiler and has a silky smooth texture.

Assembly

Place a round disk of genoise or sponge cake on the bottom of the glass.
Moisten the cake generously with raspberry liquor flavored simple syrup.
Cover with a small amount of lime curd and sprinkle with fresh berries and sesame seed nou gatine.
Cover with remaining curd and allow to set for a few hours. Decorate with berries, sesame seed nougatine and raspberry sorbet.

We featured this curd in the first edition of On Baking and remains one of my favorite recipes. It is quick to make and has a good balance of sweet and sour. For a less sour taste reduce the fruit juice and replace with water.
