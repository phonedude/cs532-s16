<title>Opera | Green Tea</title>
<description>
 

It has been my experience that people, who appreciate the classic Opera entremet created by Gaston Lenôtre, are usually equally impressed with a green tea version. In this variation, everything remains as the original; it is only the coffee which is replaced with Matcha (green tea).
For the moistening process of the joconde biscuit, I do prefer to use a typical combination of 3 parts simple syrup and one part green tea liqueur. Green tea liqueur brings finesse and freshness to this cake. For the assembly refer to On Baking 3, on page 645, replacing coffee buttercream with green tea buttercream and replacing coffee moistening syrup with green tea syrup.

Green tea buttercream:
 




17 oz
French style buttercream
500 g



0.25 oz
Green tea powder (Matcha)
8 g




































































































Combine green tea powder in a very small amount of water to form a paste. Combine with buttercream.
