<title>White Chocolate Mousse</title>
<description>

White chocolate mousse can be pleasing provided it is combined with bitter, tart, fruits, spices (including spicy) components.  In desserts I prefer to keep white chocolate mousse at 50-60% of the total dessert volume.  More than this amount and our guest may have a hard time finishing the dessert or simply be bored.
In this particular dessert the white chocolate mousse is harmonized with coffee. Above the layer of the white chocolate mousse is a layer of cold brewed coffee gelée and topped with a caramel dipped profiterole filled with espresso flavored pastry cream.  Chocolate sauce and cocoa nibs to finish.

If you would use this mousse in a verrine, gelatin will not be a necessary ingredient, used for an entremet, add gelatin or cocoa butter to make it possible to cut into desired shapes.
