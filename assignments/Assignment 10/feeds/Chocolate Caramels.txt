Salted chocolate caramels
A good chocolate cream caramel is not only delicious it is also very addicting. At times I prepare them with pre-toasted hazelnut which is just as with salt, an irresistible combination. Caramels can be a little finicky to prepare, undercooked and they will not cut properly, overcooked and they will be too firm. If cooked too slowly they may turn grainy, cooked too fast in a poorly made pot and the caramel may burn! It is clear to see why some people find them too much trouble.

For caramels you need a good pot to cook the mixture in. I prefer to cook caramel on an induction cook top over gas. (But then again I prefer induction for most things I do in the kitchen) If I had a rounded bottom copper pot perhaps then I would use gas. Induction cooks very fast and bothersome gas flames will not flare up along the sides of the pot.

Getting it all together!
Preferably prepare the caramel a day or at least 5 hours before dipping in crystallized couverture chocolate. Making it a day ahead will make the cutting a lot easier and the caramel will be less sticky.

Combine the first 5 listed ingredients in a heavy bottom â€“well made pan and while constantly stirring boil to 250F 121C.
Pour the caramel quickly between the rulers. Do not scrape the bowl! Scraping remnants out the bowl can very quickly make the caramel turn grainy.
Let the caramel set preferably overnight.
