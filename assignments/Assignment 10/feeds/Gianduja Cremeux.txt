<title>Gianduja Cremeux</title>

Gianduja certainly belongs in a collection of good quality chocolates and can equally be effective in many desserts. It pairs very well with a vast amount of flavors which makes it very appealing for us in the pastry atelier. Flavors such as coffee, passion fruit, citrus, chocolate, certain peppers are prime candidates for pairing.
This Gianduja cremeux can also be made with an in house version of Gianduja as I show here .  If using the in house version you will have to slightly increase the gelatin amount. However may I recommend keeping the gelatin amount low to retain a very silky and tender textured cremeux?

Gianduja Cremeux:
 




17 oz
Heavy cream
500 g



17 oz
Milk
500 g



3.5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
100 g



6 oz
Egg yolk
180 g



pinch
salt
pinch



3
Gelatin sheets/leaves
3



16 oz
Milk chocolate Gianduja, chopped
470 g









4 oz
Frangelico liqueur
120 g


























































Place gelatin sheets in ice water and set aside.
Bring cream and milk to boil. Meanwhile whisk yolks and sugar to ribbon consistency. Add one fourth of boiling mixture to yolks and whisk rapidly.
Pour tempered yolks to remaining boiled cream and heat gently while constantly stirring using a rubber spatula to 82°C (183°F).
Remove from heat, press gelatin sheets and whisk into the mixture.  Whisk in Gianduja. Add Frangelico.
At this stage the mixture may look foamy and it is best to set into an ice bath stirring occasionally. This will slowly erase the foamy layer and allow a beautiful surface when poured in verrines.
If using cake or dacquoise in the verrine, pre-chilling the cremeux will prevent these from floating to the surface. “Gluing” these down with chocolate is also effective.
Pour in verrines, cover with plastic food wrap and place in refrigerator. Setting will take 4 hours and complete setting will take 15 hours.
Decorate with lime marshmallow as shown on my site here and chocolate caramel tuile.
