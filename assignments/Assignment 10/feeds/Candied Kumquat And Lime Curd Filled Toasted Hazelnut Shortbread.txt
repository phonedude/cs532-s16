<title>Candied Kumquat And Lime Curd Filled Toasted Hazelnut Shortbread</title>
<description>

Toasted hazelnuts deliver an incomparable flavor to this shortbread. For optimum flavor, toast hazelnuts in a medium temperature oven until the heart of hazelnuts are golden brown. I do not advise to grind hazelnuts in a food processor without another ingredient present; it most often leads to hazelnut paste. Adding pastry flour to the toasted hazelnuts prevents this from happening.
For optimum flavor prepare dough at least one day in advance as in most cases a fuller aroma develops.
Needed for Assembly:
