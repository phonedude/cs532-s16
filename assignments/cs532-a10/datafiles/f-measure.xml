    <title>INXS - "Don't Change" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342576+00:00</updated>

    <title>The Time - "Jungle Love" (forgotten song)</title>

    <title>David Bowie - "Blackstar" (spotlight)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342620+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-adPuQ1U1ARQ/VpPFczOykAI/AAAAAAAABwc/yikL_h-XdoA/s1600/david-bowie-blackstar-single.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="199" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-adPuQ1U1ARQ/VpPFczOykAI/AAAAAAAABwc/yikL_h-XdoA/s200/david-bowie-blackstar-single.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie"&gt;David Bowie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35278872"&gt;died yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Obviously when an icon of this stature dies it is tempting to recall any of his numerous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie#Legacy_and_influence"&gt;popular and/or influential works&lt;/a&gt; (with "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_%28David_Bowie_album%29"&gt;Low&lt;/a&gt;" being an example of &lt;i&gt;influential&lt;/i&gt; but not really &lt;i&gt;popular&lt;/i&gt;, at least by comparison to other works in his canon).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I prefer to draw your attention to "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstar_%28David_Bowie_song%29"&gt;Blackstar&lt;/a&gt;", which came out about six weeks ago, right before Thanksgiving.&amp;nbsp; I heard it driving home one night on "&lt;a href="http://whro.org/radio/personalities/paul-shugrue"&gt;Out of the Box&lt;/a&gt;" and was struck by the fact that although it was clearly David Bowie, it sounded like classic Bowie but I couldn't identify the song.&amp;nbsp; And there were modern influences as well, so maybe it wasn't a classic song.&amp;nbsp; And "Out of the Box" focuses on new music -- was this a re-release?.&amp;nbsp; Was it another artist ripping off Bowie?&amp;nbsp; Eventually I was able to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shazam_%28service%29"&gt;shazam&lt;/a&gt; the song and learn that it was the title track from his &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstar_(David_Bowie_album)"&gt;forthcoming LP&lt;/a&gt; (which was released just two days before his death).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I texted &amp;amp; emailed with all my music buddies saying "you need to check out this new Bowie song".&amp;nbsp; The summary of those conversations was how effortlessly it was both modern &amp;amp; classic, seamlessly incorporating the past &amp;amp; present.&amp;nbsp; And as a bonus, the video was mysterious &amp;amp; freaky.&amp;nbsp; I had planned to blog about it then, but with the holidays it got delayed.&amp;nbsp; His illness had not been made public, so I did not realize there was much time left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don't just remember &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie#1972.E2.80.9373:_Ziggy_Stardust"&gt;Ziggy Stardust&lt;/a&gt; and other characters.&amp;nbsp; Remember Bowie for making engaging, challenging music for his entire career, even right at the end.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Bowie - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kszLwBaC4Sw"&gt;Blackstar&lt;/a&gt;".</content>

In the popular imagination, he’s made up of equal parts Jack Daniel’s, amphetamine sulphate, Nazi memorabilia and extreme-velocity noise. The myths and legends cloak him as surely as the black shirt, the black jeans, the custom-made boots, the cowboy hat with its “Death or Glory” insignia and the Iron Cross around his neck.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Of course, Lemmy is best known as the vocalist &amp;amp; bassist -- and only permanent member -- for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot%C3%B6rhead"&gt;Motorhead&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Motorhead, of course, is the seminal band that first combined outlaw biker imagery with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot%C3%B6rhead#Style"&gt;punk style / ethos &amp;amp; metal heaviness&lt;/a&gt;, although Lemmy always insisted they were simply a "rock-n-roll band".&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, he was innovative in that he played bass like it was a lead instrument and not rhythm.&amp;nbsp; But before there was Motorhead, there was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkwind"&gt;Hawkwind&lt;/a&gt; -- the seminal space rock group, featuring &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hawkwind_band_members"&gt;fluid membership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moorcock"&gt;Michael Moorcock&lt;/a&gt; inspired imagery &amp;amp; lyrics, and nearly limitless &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Spinal_Tap"&gt;Spinal Tap-esque&lt;/a&gt; cliches (including one of the first appearances of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Space#Sleeve"&gt;heavy metal umlaut&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could memorialize Lemmy with any of numerous excellent Motorhead songs, but instead I'll choose Hawkwind's 1972 single, "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Machine"&gt;Silver Machine&lt;/a&gt;", which he didn't even write but I believe was the first song on which he sang lead (he was not the primary vocalist for Hawkwind), and turned out to be Hawkwind's only "hit" song.&amp;nbsp; Although Lemmy would not be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy#1971.E2.80.931975:_Hawkwind"&gt;fired from Hawkwind&lt;/a&gt; for another three years, this is probably the song that set him on the path from "band member" to "band leader".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoZ_Lg21b14"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; is the one shown on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Machine#Top_of_the_Pops"&gt;BBC's Top of the Pops in 1972&lt;/a&gt; (instead of having the band in the studio lip syncing).&amp;nbsp; It features Lemmy in his pre-Motorhead, all black garb.&amp;nbsp; The sound is early-70s groovy, the studio version is badly synced with the concert footage, which features bubbles, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nik_Turner"&gt;flautist&lt;/a&gt; (!) and, of course, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacia"&gt;dancer&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You can't make this stuff up.&amp;nbsp; Despite (because of?) all that, the song rawks and I love it.&amp;nbsp; Danette hates it, for all of the same reasons listed above, though she does like Motorhead in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month ago, The Atlantic had an article featuring Lemmy and entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/twilight-of-the-headbangers/407848/"&gt;Twilight of the Headbangers: How long can the legends of heavy metal keep on rocking?&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Not long enough, though I think we have to count ourselves lucky that he made it to 70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawkwind - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoZ_Lg21b14"&gt;Silver Machine&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WUgKqw1CEPc/VoQTEyjWePI/AAAAAAAABwE/MW3xrYZ1Zh4/s1600/motorhead-btl-ltw.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="196" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WUgKqw1CEPc/VoQTEyjWePI/AAAAAAAABwE/MW3xrYZ1Zh4/s200/motorhead-btl-ltw.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/OfficialMotorhead/posts/1107561019276205"&gt;Born to Lose, Lived to Win&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Waxahatchee - "Cerulean Salt" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342670+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XiLYESL4QaQ/VnxS0B0W7CI/AAAAAAAABvc/HMqOyOdNUx8/s1600/cerulean-salt.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XiLYESL4QaQ/VnxS0B0W7CI/AAAAAAAABvc/HMqOyOdNUx8/s200/cerulean-salt.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just over a year ago I reviewed "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2014/10/waxahatchee-american-weekend-lp-review.html"&gt;American Weekend&lt;/a&gt;", the debut LP from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxahatchee"&gt;Waxahatchee&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Her second LP "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerulean_Salt"&gt;Cerulean Salt&lt;/a&gt;" (2013) finds her backed by a "real band" (actually members shared with her sister's band, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swearin'"&gt;Swearin'&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas "American Weekend" was a solo, lo-fi, bedroom recording masterpiece, "Cerulean Salt" doesn't try to duplicate that success.&amp;nbsp; The songs are still sparse and minimally produced, but are enriched by the fuller sound afforded by the presence of band members.&amp;nbsp; Some of them even downright rawk -- such as "Coast to Coast" and especially "Misery Over Dispute".&amp;nbsp; And while the comparison to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Phair"&gt;Liz Phair&lt;/a&gt; continues (exhibit A: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nyLqJjCglU"&gt;Brother Bryan&lt;/a&gt;" vs. "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiEwavLjpeo"&gt;Girls! Girls! Girls!&lt;/a&gt;"; Exhibit B: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmEaIveGJzs"&gt;Dixie Cups and Jars&lt;/a&gt;" vs. "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkssHBwG6CY"&gt;Go West&lt;/a&gt;"), a more thematic comparison would be to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen#Lyrical_themes"&gt;Bruce Springsteen&lt;/a&gt; in that the glossy, upbeat songs hide some pretty dark lyrics.&amp;nbsp; Almost any song would do, but it's hard to beat "&lt;a href="http://genius.com/Waxahatchee-dixie-cups-and-jars-lyrics"&gt;Dixie Cups and Jars&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I'm not a whipper in the wind&lt;br /&gt;Or solace laying at the bottom of a bottle&lt;br /&gt;Or your thick skin&lt;br /&gt;Escape yells both our names out loud&lt;br /&gt;We run like hell, I'll write a tragic epilogue and you'll act it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched your dad give you away&lt;br /&gt;I watched him drink the bitter taste in his exertion away&lt;br /&gt;Make-up sits on your face like tar&lt;br /&gt;The champagne flutes poorly engineered&lt;br /&gt;Employ dixie cups and jars&lt;/blockquote&gt;A more eloquent LP review is available at &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17688-waxahatchee-cerulean-salt/"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I will say that while it doesn't speak to me personally like "American Weekend", "Cerulean Salt" is arguably a better all around LP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmEaIveGJzs"&gt;Dixie Cups and Jars&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I06fxqaMsSk"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nyLqJjCglU"&gt;Brother Bryan&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aSLTh-DwKE"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHivBJoFa_0"&gt;Coast to Coast&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlhFE8-KBDE"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfCRtyQ_omc"&gt;live w/ Mish Way&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NwIeK7-DjA"&gt;Tangled Envisioning&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-d4VWwNFxY"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se2ksyP2XuU"&gt;Misery Over Dispute&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwH9lWmLRd8"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY9bqHD5Csw"&gt;Lively&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa-CnAbtntI"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQusUE8y3SA"&gt;Swan Dive&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA-77mdPJIA"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10.&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>Balam Acab - "See Birds" (LP Review)</title>

Eliot&lt;/a&gt; actually break up?" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88LniuRnsg8" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once again, you should check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3I2GFN_F8WudD_2jUZbojA"&gt;KEXP's awesome YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Galaxie 500 - "Rain" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342763+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RpNQbn40AzI/VeSGcKK7lmI/AAAAAAAABqw/7fCchLvZtTs/s1600/galaxie-500-rain.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="199" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RpNQbn40AzI/VeSGcKK7lmI/AAAAAAAABqw/7fCchLvZtTs/s200/galaxie-500-rain.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The last release from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxie_500"&gt;Galaxie 500&lt;/a&gt; before they broke up was the single "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Galaxie-500-Rain/release/1456989"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt;",&amp;nbsp; recorded live in 1989 at NYC's iconic &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBGB"&gt;CBGB&lt;/a&gt; and then released in 1990.&amp;nbsp; Galaxie 500's choice of covers were always impeccable (see my review of their "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/05/galaxie-500-peel-sessions-lp-review.html"&gt;Peel Sessions&lt;/a&gt;" LP), and their version of "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_%28Beatles_song%29"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt;" is no different.&amp;nbsp; "Rain" is probably the most famous B-side (the A-side was "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperback_Writer"&gt;Paperback Writer&lt;/a&gt;") from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt; canon, and was recorded during the "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver_(Beatles_album)"&gt;Revolver&lt;/a&gt;" sessions (the non-LP single came out a few months before "Revolver" was released).&amp;nbsp; With backwards vocals at the end of the track, "Rain" nicely captures the band in transition from their earlier &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jangle_pop"&gt;jangle pop&lt;/a&gt; to their later psychedelic sound.&amp;nbsp; They also recorded three different "promotional films" for this song (what we now call "music videos") -- quite an investment for a B-side.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Galaxie 500 successfully captures the essence of the original, albeit with a heavier sound courtesy of the live recording.&amp;nbsp; Their original 7" single was limited to 500 copies and featured "Rain" as the A-side and the B-side featured a live version of "Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste", the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Richman"&gt;Jonathan Richmond&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Lovers"&gt;Modern Lovers&lt;/a&gt; cover from their &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/12/galaxie-500-today-lp-review.html"&gt;first LP&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Given the rarity of this single, you're more likely to have heard the concatenated version from the posthumously released LP "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncollected"&gt;Uncollected&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, I'm not aware of a studio recording of "Rain" by Galaxie 500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Galaxie 500: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHwXt-Toe3g"&gt;Rain / Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste&lt;/a&gt;"(&lt;a href="https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/track/rain-dont-let-our-youth-go-to-waste"&gt;mp3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beatles: "Rain" -- &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKmJGXhSmaY"&gt;video 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz4PCnIyLdg"&gt;video 2&lt;/a&gt;, video 3 (link suggestions welcome)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.B. &amp;nbsp; I've been meaning to feature this song for a while, but the rainy start to our time at Ocean Isle Beach, NC has made this especially appropriate.&amp;nbsp; A rainy day at the beach still beats a sunny day at work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I can show you&lt;br /&gt;That when it starts to rain&lt;br /&gt;Everything's the same&lt;br /&gt;I can show you&lt;br /&gt;I can show you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain, I don't mind&lt;br /&gt;Shine, the weather's fine&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

    <title>LCD Soundsystem - "All My Friends" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342777+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GQI0nb3q3tM/Vc9H-5J8CxI/AAAAAAAABpI/srAhCJ9QJlM/s1600/LCD_Soundsystem_-_All_My_Friends_cover_art.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GQI0nb3q3tM/Vc9H-5J8CxI/AAAAAAAABpI/srAhCJ9QJlM/s200/LCD_Soundsystem_-_All_My_Friends_cover_art.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've been meaning to write about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCD_Soundsystem"&gt;LCD Soundsystem&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_My_Friends"&gt;All My Friends&lt;/a&gt;" (from their 2007 LP "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_of_Silver"&gt;Sound of Silver&lt;/a&gt;") for a couple of years now, but this week's &lt;a href="http://www.richmond.com/obituaries/article_dd448cff-1dd3-5e61-954c-d8201092859b.html"&gt;unexpected passing of long-time friend Fred Moore&lt;/a&gt; has finally moved me to write about this song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was late in discovering LCD Soundsystem, only finding out about them from the &lt;a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/qtecuk/the-colbert-report-james-murphy-of-lcd-soundsystem"&gt;Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, right before James Murphy ended the band.&amp;nbsp; I got several of their LPs shortly after that, and immediately fell in love with them.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murphy_%28electronic_musician%29"&gt;James Murphy&lt;/a&gt; is about my age and his aesthetics and influences deeply resonate with mine. But it wasn't until I was listening to their LPs at the beach a couple years later before the impact and meaning of "All My Friends" really hit me.&amp;nbsp; A quick google searched proved that I was not alone in my assessment, with the first page containing articles such as "&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2007/07/all_my_friends.html"&gt;The Melancholy Greatness of `All My Friends'&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1469481/deconstructing-lcd-soundsystems-all-my-friends-and-trying-to-define-the-best-song-of-the-millennium/franchises/deconstructing/"&gt;Deconstructing: LCD Soundsystem’s 'All My Friends' And Trying To Define The Best Song Of The Millennium&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Both articles are eloquent perspectives which I won't try to expand on, but only to say that you would be hard pressed to come up with a better soundtrack for a bunch middle-age guys getting together for the weekend ("&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/04/hank-williams-jr-all-my-rowdy-friends.html"&gt;All My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down)&lt;/a&gt;" is a less nuanced and more literal 2nd place entry).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend Drew got married in the summer of 2012, and most of the high-school &amp;amp; college friends had dispersed up and down the east coast.&amp;nbsp; Richmond VA was central for most of the people, so we gathered there for an impromptu bachelor party for him.&amp;nbsp; We had such a good time that we decided to make it an annual occurrence, with our fourth event occurring last July.&amp;nbsp; For one weekend a year we could run around the city, pretend we're still 22, and try to stay out until last call at 2am (not everyone made it).&amp;nbsp; I had stayed close with both Drew and Terry, but the wedding and then these annual events was a good way to reconnect with other friends that I had mostly lost contact with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any story about high-school &amp;amp; college mischief would inevitably feature Fred Moore as a central figure.&amp;nbsp; I won't even try to recount the numerous stories, other than to say no one was surprised when Fred was the first member of &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/dag-nasty-wig-out-at-denkos-forgotten.html"&gt;Tone Deaf&lt;/a&gt; (the high-school band for which he was lead vocals) to spend the night in jail (IIRC, drunk in public while he was at Va Tech).&amp;nbsp; Either despite or because of his wild years, Fred eventually became a well-respected and much-loved Major in the Virginia National Guard, husband, and father of two.&amp;nbsp; He did tours in Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan.&amp;nbsp; His passing was a shock to all, but I'm glad I was able to hang out with him again over the last four years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the song: it is amazing enough by itself, but I have much respect for LCD Soundsystem releasing two versions of the single: one featuring a cover of the song by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cale"&gt;John Cale&lt;/a&gt; and the other featuring a cover of the song by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Ferdinand_(band)"&gt;Franz Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt;, each one competing with each other and the original as to who can incorporate the most &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Curtis"&gt;Ian Curtis&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division"&gt;Joy Division&lt;/a&gt; influences. &amp;nbsp; I don't often reproduce all the lyrics for a song, but in this case it is necessary (the Pink Floyd reference is perfect):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;That's how it starts&lt;br /&gt;We go back to your house&lt;br /&gt;You check the charts&lt;br /&gt;And start to figure it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if it's crowded, all the better&lt;br /&gt;Because we know we're gonna be up late&lt;br /&gt;But if you're worried about the weather&lt;br /&gt;Then you picked the wrong place to stay&lt;br /&gt;That's how it starts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it starts&lt;br /&gt;You switch the engine on&lt;br /&gt;We &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_the_Controls_for_the_Heart_of_the_Sun"&gt;set controls for the heart of the sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the ways that we show our age&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up&lt;br /&gt;And I still don't wanna stagger home&lt;br /&gt;Then it's the memory of our betters&lt;br /&gt;That are keeping us on our feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan&lt;br /&gt;And the next five years trying to be with your friends again&lt;br /&gt;Oh, you're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes apart&lt;br /&gt;The way it does in bad films&lt;br /&gt;Except the part&lt;br /&gt;Where the moral kicks in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when we're running out of the drugs&lt;br /&gt;And the conversation's grinding away&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn't trade one stupid decision&lt;br /&gt;For another five years of life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can&lt;br /&gt;And the next ten people who are trying to be polite&lt;br /&gt;When you're blowing 85 days in the middle of France&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to tell the truth&lt;br /&gt;Oh, this could be the last time&lt;br /&gt;So here we go&lt;br /&gt;Like a sales force into the night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool&lt;br /&gt;On the road, there's always this&lt;br /&gt;And if I'm sued into submission&lt;br /&gt;I can still come home to this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand&lt;br /&gt;You can sleep on the plane or review what you said&lt;br /&gt;When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned&lt;br /&gt;You think over and over "Hey, I'm finally dead."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand&lt;br /&gt;You can turn it on yourself you ridiculous clown&lt;br /&gt;You forgot what you meant when you read what you said&lt;br /&gt;And you knew you were tired&lt;br /&gt;But then where are your friends tonight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where are your friends tonight?&lt;br /&gt;Where are your friends tonight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could see all my friends tonight&lt;br /&gt;If I could see all my friends tonight&lt;br /&gt;If I could see all my friends tonight&lt;br /&gt;If I could see all my friends tonight&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LCD Soundsystem: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kPyjUMmCL4#t=23m13s"&gt;All My Friends&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L8yEDcZ-QI"&gt;London Sessions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX1_civ9WMY"&gt;2011 MSG live version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Cale: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPKstHYnVR0"&gt;All My Friends&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Franz Ferdinand: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbTAFqnZkL0"&gt;All My Friends&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust we will get together in 2016, but we'll need a Busch beer set out for our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_man_table"&gt;missing man&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

    <title>Andy Stott - "Luxury Problems" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342805+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VGxM3wwDHWc/VbOmxyZOalI/AAAAAAAABnU/Ju2H9YvUdhQ/s1600/andy-stott-luxury-problems.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VGxM3wwDHWc/VbOmxyZOalI/AAAAAAAABnU/Ju2H9YvUdhQ/s200/andy-stott-luxury-problems.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For a while I've been searching for the words to describe &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stott"&gt;Andy Stott&lt;/a&gt;'s 2012 release "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_Problems_%28album%29"&gt;Luxury Problems&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; His two 2011 EPs, "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/"&gt;Passed Me By&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/"&gt;We Stay Together&lt;/a&gt;", are darkly mesmerizing but "Luxury Problems" represents a significant step forward.&amp;nbsp; There's still the vast, rich, looming soundscapes that Stott paints that only occasionally veer into the realm of conventional song structures (the title track being perhaps being the closest thing to a "song"), but the thing that really sets this LP apart is the expert sampling of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8973-andy-stott/"&gt;Alison Skidmore&lt;/a&gt;'s vocals that give this LP a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julee_Cruise"&gt;Julee Cruise&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Fraser"&gt;Elizabeth Fraser&lt;/a&gt; aesthetic while at the same time crafting a unique sound.&amp;nbsp; The result is an angelic touch to an otherwise menacing, bleak movie soundtrack where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28Terminator%29"&gt;Skynet&lt;/a&gt; is the hero instead of the villain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The professional reviews are more eloquent (&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/luxury-problems-mw0002424505"&gt;Allmusic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/andy-stott-luxury-problems"&gt;Tiny Mix Tapes&lt;/a&gt;), but words are ultimately insufficient.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aGEmhzQFr8"&gt;all of them&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10, including the rare "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/beyond%20music"&gt;beyond music&lt;/a&gt;" label.&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>Connan Mockasin - "Caramel" (LP Review)</title>

I won't claim I completely understand this LP, but there is something weirdly beautiful happening here -- you just have to listen and decide if it works for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to break from my regular LP review format and just list the 11 songs since although they're distinct, they're so inter-related that you really shouldn't separate them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTj09PvBj2I"&gt;Nothing Lasts Forever&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdCz7zqfvP4"&gt;Caramel&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-JDih6hTA0"&gt;I'm the Man, That Will Find You&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Teyy1A_AJso"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bKcT8Dx12M"&gt;Do I Make You Feel Shy?&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZl0ro-Pnb8"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwm05bcV-PI"&gt;Why Are You Crying?&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Od09a8QrTk"&gt;It's Your Body 1&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0tFN9nPtSQ"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4rWfWnIsPM"&gt;It's Your Body 2&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcT2CSJrI6s"&gt;It's Your Body 3&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv2NcnXl_tU"&gt;It's Your Body 4&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu4VJ9reOOE"&gt;It's Your Body 5&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm5mrWx0yNM"&gt;I Wanna Roll with You&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DnMJxDjauA"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The official &amp;amp; live videos, while sufficiently surreal, somehow aren't surreal enough compare to the visions the songs conjure in my mind.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 7/10.&amp;nbsp; It grows on you; I reserve the right to raise this in the future.</content>

    <title>Minutemen - "Double Nickels on the Dime" (LP review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342836+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpDSjOi25hY/VY7zxh7FhqI/AAAAAAAABl4/T3h99bcPv_0/s1600/minutemen-doublenickels.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpDSjOi25hY/VY7zxh7FhqI/AAAAAAAABl4/T3h99bcPv_0/s200/minutemen-doublenickels.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Why don't I like this more than I do?&amp;nbsp; On paper, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen_(band)"&gt;Minutemen&lt;/a&gt; and their double LP "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Nickels_on_the_Dime"&gt;Double Nickels on the Dime&lt;/a&gt;" combine everything I like: an 80s punk trio on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SST_Records"&gt;SST Records&lt;/a&gt;, clever, satirical, humorous, biting political commentary, a complete embrace of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_ethic#Punk_culture"&gt;DIY&lt;/a&gt;, genre-bending, sly references to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummagumma"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys"&gt;Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_American_automobile_culture"&gt;California Car Culture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous other influences.&amp;nbsp; Even the book that I've referenced numerous times in this blog, "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life"&gt;Our Band Could Be Your Life&lt;/a&gt;", takes its title from their song "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_Lesson_%E2%80%93_Part_II"&gt;History Lesson - Part II&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; This LP is on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Nickels_on_the_Dime#Critical_recognition"&gt;nearly every "best of" list made&lt;/a&gt;, and is beloved by many artists that I love/respect (e.g., &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Flag_(band)"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I struggle to capture why this LP doesn't mean more to me.&amp;nbsp; Part of it surely &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Boon"&gt;D. Boon&lt;/a&gt;'s guitar style: he's good (at the risk of damning with faint praise, they're all surprisingly good for a punk band), but the clean yet thin production and the rockabilly &amp;amp; funk influences leaves too much negative space for my taste.&amp;nbsp; The LP was produced by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_James_%28producer%29"&gt;Ethan James&lt;/a&gt;, rather than SST's normal in house producer, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_%28producer%29"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;, who made things muddy but heavy.&amp;nbsp; Granted, I found out about this LP much later in life, but it still doesn't speak to me in the same way of, say, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2014/03/mission-of-burma-signals-calls-and.html"&gt;Mission of Burma&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Also, as a teenager I'm pretty sure I would not have found this LP heavy enough since my preferences were more in line with &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Husker%20Du"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, there are no bad songs on this LP and although songs like "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmFWCb06LQc"&gt;It's Expected I'm Gone&lt;/a&gt;" have too much of the aforementioned negative space, I can't call them bad.&amp;nbsp; And some of the songs are quite good, with my favorite being the precious "History Lesson - Part II", whose autobiographical lyrics capture the friendship between D. Boon and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Watt"&gt;Mike Watt&lt;/a&gt; as the core element of the band, a band that provided a path out of an otherwise &lt;a href="http://genius.com/Minutemen-this-aint-no-picnic-lyrics"&gt;dead-end, blue collar life&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life"&gt;our band could be your life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;real names'd be proof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Boon"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Watt"&gt;mike watt&lt;/a&gt; played for years&lt;br /&gt;punk rock changed our lives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we learned punk rock in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood"&gt;hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;drove up from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro,_Los_Angeles,_California"&gt;pedro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we were fucking corndogs&lt;br /&gt;we'd go drink and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_%28dance%29"&gt;pogo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mr. narrator&lt;br /&gt;this is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan"&gt;bob dylan&lt;/a&gt; to me&lt;br /&gt;my story could be his songs&lt;br /&gt;i'm his soldier child&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;our band is scientist rock&lt;br /&gt;but i was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bloom"&gt;e. bloom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hell"&gt;richard hell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer"&gt;joe strummer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe_%28musician%29"&gt;john doe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me and mike watt, playing guitar &lt;/blockquote&gt;This song is made even more poignant because D. Boon died in an automobile accident in 1985, effectively ending the band (though drummer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hurley"&gt;George Hurley&lt;/a&gt; and Mike Watt would continue for a while as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose_%28band%29"&gt;Firehose&lt;/a&gt;) and leaving this song as the band's eulogy. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive thing for the band is, that unlike many of their punk contemporaries, they were respectful and knowledgeable of their influences.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the name checks provided in the lyrics above, they also did non-ironic covers of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival"&gt;CCR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen"&gt;Van Halen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_Dan"&gt;Steely Dan&lt;/a&gt; (even though the LP name is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Nickels_on_the_Dime#Imagery"&gt;shot at Sammy Hagar&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZvsAh5VFRw"&gt;History Lesson - Part II&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfzhq1CjJG0"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=206f0dLjtds"&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;" (live), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDr25zjd4yM"&gt;This Ain't No Picnic&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfgQtKzQq0U"&gt;Take 5, D.&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVH7kUs7hvY"&gt;Dr. Wu&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qQFiS-6wig"&gt;The Big Foist&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: I'm sticking with a 6/10, but you should realize that most people other than me would give this a 10/10.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 2005 band documentary "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Jam_Econo"&gt;We Jam Econo&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmKGusadv08"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Pink Floyd reference?&amp;nbsp; In the style of "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummagumma"&gt;Ummagumma&lt;/a&gt;", the 4 sides are named: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LjMeGtgE0M"&gt;Side D.&lt;/a&gt;", "Side Mike", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxu5fID_mMU"&gt;Side George&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfgQtKzQq0U"&gt;Side Chaff&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Where's "Side Mike"?&amp;nbsp; The TV show "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackass_(TV_series)"&gt;Jackass&lt;/a&gt;" used "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_%28song%29"&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;" as its theme song, and the result seems to be that no studio version of the song can be found on the web.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure why Jackass would use the song when it's about the &lt;a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858538284/"&gt;appalling conditions&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; discrepancies between tourists and locals in Mexico.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxeg5a4-epw"&gt;acoustic, public-access TV concert&lt;/a&gt; from 1985.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>Split Enz - "History Never Repeats" (forgotten song)</title>

    <title>Hum - "Stars" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342866+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YW4jJZAaWrg/VTV1U734lVI/AAAAAAAABjo/RnoLP5Tl4aw/s1600/hum-stars.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YW4jJZAaWrg/VTV1U734lVI/AAAAAAAABjo/RnoLP5Tl4aw/s1600/hum-stars.jpeg" height="198" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This song has been on low rotation on 96x for a while now, but I finally &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shazam_%28service%29"&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt;'d it on the way to work today.&amp;nbsp; I was going to post something snarky like "this new song incorporates everything I loved about early- to mid-90s rock", but then when I googled it I found out this song did indeed come out in 1995!&amp;nbsp; At first, I was happy that I had pegged the time frame so nicely, and then I started to wonder how I had missed this song 20 years ago...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_(Hum_song)"&gt;Stars&lt;/a&gt;" was a minor radio hit for the now defunct &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_%28band%29"&gt;Hum&lt;/a&gt;, off their 1995 major label debut "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27d_Prefer_an_Astronaut"&gt;You'd Prefer an Astronaut&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Either it did not get airplay in Hampton Roads at the time, or I've simply forgotten it.&amp;nbsp; I'm hoping for the former.&amp;nbsp; Either way, I'm enjoying it like it's 1995.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hum: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiZbDp1JOCM"&gt;Stars&lt;/a&gt;" (studio), &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vteNEV1wnEw"&gt;Late Night with Conan O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoeMHoVnjWo"&gt;120 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt1fOYfSdFc"&gt;You'd Prefer An Astronaut&lt;/a&gt;" (full LP -- I haven't listened to it yet)</content>

    <title>Celtic Frost - "Morbid Tales" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342880+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EI0E0M51jlw/VTLX-dMg_OI/AAAAAAAABjU/1oEbSEtvJCY/s1600/celtic-frost-morbid-tales.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="198" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EI0E0M51jlw/VTLX-dMg_OI/AAAAAAAABjU/1oEbSEtvJCY/s1600/celtic-frost-morbid-tales.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Enough of the &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-beach-boys-wild-honey-lp-review.html"&gt;Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2015/02/lesley-gore-you-dont-own-me-song.html"&gt;Lesley Gore&lt;/a&gt;, etc. -- today we're going back to high school and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Frost"&gt;Celtic Frost&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I remember Scott Kinkade getting their debut EP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbid_Tales"&gt;Morbid Tales&lt;/a&gt;" as an import in 1984.&amp;nbsp; Although I was a fan, I was never the biggest CF fan at the time (their goth-viking &lt;a href="http://img.wax.fm/releases/1186559/celtic-frost-morbid-tales-2147741.jpeg"&gt;visual imagery&lt;/a&gt; was especially silly), so it with some surprise that when I revisit it now I realize that the music has held up so well after 30+ years.&amp;nbsp; The debt they owe to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt; is more apparent to me now, although they extend that sound with the speed and punk-like attitude (for lack of a better term) of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot%C3%B6rhead"&gt;Motorhead&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The production is mid-80s awful, but again that's part of the charm (cf. &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/blacktask-blacktask-lp-review.html"&gt;Blacktask&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; This stuff is ferocious in a way that more polished &amp;amp; produced metal just can't touch.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in retrospect, their lyrics were much better than most of their contemporaries.&amp;nbsp; Certainly they were into the whole doom/black metal thing, but their lyrics borrow more from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian"&gt;Conan&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Tales"&gt;Weird Tales&lt;/a&gt; milieu instead of, say, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_%28band%29"&gt;Venom&lt;/a&gt;'s comically satanic imagery.&amp;nbsp; With songs like "Into Crypts of Rays" (about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_de_Rais"&gt;Gilles de Rais&lt;/a&gt;) , they get points for realizing history provides more sources for "morbid tales" than fantasy ever could.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1DVq5C6AuI"&gt;Into the Crypts of Rays&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0z-8E5JyuU"&gt;Visions of Mortality&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaytIdLYtPc"&gt;Procreation (Of the Wicked)&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gizEFiCVShs"&gt;Return to the Eve&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3WLw-ALaV0"&gt;Danse Macabre&lt;/a&gt;",&amp;nbsp; "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8-sKFuUBQ8"&gt;Nocturnal Fear&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp; (that's all six from the original European import; later versions had additional songs -- &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FgfzDJPp3w"&gt;full EP on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 8/10.&amp;nbsp; And not just from nostalgia or irony, but neither is it focusing on its significant influence on later bands.&amp;nbsp; Even out of its historical context, this is just really good, heavy music.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gizEFiCVShs#t=2m41s"&gt;Take my soul away into the dark, dreaming 1000 morbid dreams, no tomorrow when the wind caresses my mind, could I ever return, it would be my doom.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;--"Return to the Eve"</content>

    <title>The Beach Boys - "Wild Honey" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342894+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AhDo8d6UL7s/VRB7TL3yuWI/AAAAAAAABio/_nQVTmkftPk/s1600/beach-boys-wild-honey.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AhDo8d6UL7s/VRB7TL3yuWI/AAAAAAAABio/_nQVTmkftPk/s1600/beach-boys-wild-honey.jpeg" height="200" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Like most people, my knowledge of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys"&gt;The Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt; ceases from about 1967 (resulting from the whole "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28The_Beach_Boys_album%29"&gt;Smile&lt;/a&gt;" / "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley_Smile"&gt;Smiley Smile&lt;/a&gt;" debacle) until their emergence in the 1980s as a nostalgia act.&amp;nbsp; Doing some detailed reading in their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys_discography"&gt;discography&lt;/a&gt; reveals they continued to release LPs pretty regularly until about 1980.&amp;nbsp; The reviews of some of those LPs are pretty good (corresponding to the ascendancy of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilson"&gt;Carl Wilson&lt;/a&gt; within the band's hierarchy): Allmusic gives 1967's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Honey_(album)"&gt;Wild Honey&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/r1423"&gt;4/5 stars&lt;/a&gt;, 1968's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_%28The_Beach_Boys_album%29"&gt;Friends&lt;/a&gt;" also gets &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/friends-mw0000615366"&gt;4/5 stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/r30145"&gt;3.5/5&lt;/a&gt; stars for 1969's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20/20_%28The_Beach_Boys_album%29"&gt;20/20&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/sunflower-mw0000310518"&gt;4.5/5&lt;/a&gt; stars for 1970's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_%28The_Beach_Boys_album%29"&gt;Sunflower&lt;/a&gt;" (it also made Rolling Stone's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time"&gt;500 Greatest LPs of All Times&lt;/a&gt;"), and finally &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/surfs-up-mw0000316801"&gt;4/5&lt;/a&gt; stars for 1971's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf%27s_Up_%28album%29"&gt;Surf's Up&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; That's a pretty strong showing for five LPs, with only 1969's "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IWYmo2LceE"&gt;Do It Again&lt;/a&gt;" as the only song from this period that most people will recognize.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was with some anticipation that I looked forward to hearing "Wild Honey", which in 2001 was appended to "Smiley Smile" and various contemporary outtakes for a &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11667-smiley-smilewild-honey/"&gt;bonus CD&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Had I just received a forgotten gem from this unexplored portion of their discography?&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; No, I had not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't speak for the other LPs listed above, but "Wild Honey" is a really bad LP and no amount of nostalgic revisionism can change that.&amp;nbsp; The title track is mildly interesting, sounding like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Wonder"&gt;Stevie Wonder&lt;/a&gt; with a theremin, but I think it stands out only because the rest of the soul-inspired songs fall flatter than does "Wild Honey".&amp;nbsp; "Darlin'" pauses the Stevie Wonder theft long enough to steal from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_%28band%29"&gt;the Four Seasons&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The best two tracks are 1) "Country Air" which although written for this LP would sound at home on "Smile" or "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Sounds"&gt;Pet Sounds&lt;/a&gt;", and 2) "Mama Says", a reworking of the acapella&amp;nbsp; break from "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetables_%28song%29"&gt;Vegetables&lt;/a&gt;" (left off "Smiley Smile" but present on "Smile").&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double CD is worth getting, but adjust your expectations for "Wild Honey".&amp;nbsp; The Beach Boys excursion to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown"&gt;Motown&lt;/a&gt; has as much skill and authenticity as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_Ice"&gt;Robert Van Winkle&lt;/a&gt; brought to rap some 22 years later...&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlBCGRAn7oA"&gt;Country Air&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXILKwxEq_Y"&gt;Mama Says&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Songs that appear: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpTnLK5mxu4"&gt;Wild Honey&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS6m0fN-Ow0"&gt;live 1972&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ-CHtccbGE"&gt;Darlin'&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 3/10.&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>Avett Brothers - Austin, TX 2014-10-11 (concert)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342922+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T_KlV3pLE3A/VNeIouTp2wI/AAAAAAAABgo/nhH7RmZ8huc/s1600/avett-brothers-abq-2015-02-04.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

concert in Albuquerque, New Mexico 2015-02-04 (&lt;a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-avett-brothers/2015/santa-ana-star-center-rio-rancho-nm-1bca2914.html"&gt;setlist&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; They went to the show on my recommendation and although they I think they enjoyed it, the Avett Brothers didn't resonate with them as much as they do with Danette and me.&amp;nbsp; One thing they mentioned about the NM show is that the venue, the &lt;a href="http://www.santaanastarcenter.com/"&gt;Santa Ana Star Center&lt;/a&gt;, was too large for a band like the Avett Brothers.&amp;nbsp; Judging by their picture, it looks like their seats were pretty good, but they still felt the venue was not intimate enough for the kind of music they play.&amp;nbsp; This echos our experience in the &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-avett-brothers-raleigh-nc-2014-12.html"&gt;NYE 2014 show in Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; where we had really bad seats in the PNC Arena.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Our experience almost surely would have been better if I had ordered tickets sooner, but then perhaps they should not have played in a venue where bad seats were even possible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings up an interesting question: can a band grow too popular for their ideal venues?&amp;nbsp; Obviously you'd prefer to see bands in the smallest possible venues.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, you can't fault a band for gaining popularity and filling (or nearly so) increasingly larger venues.&amp;nbsp; But some bands' sound transposes to larger venues with less of a problem.&amp;nbsp; The Avett Brothers are high energy, and they've &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avett_Brothers#Permanent_members"&gt;slowly accreted band members&lt;/a&gt; to help them have a consistently bigger sound, but they're still not really an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_rock"&gt;arena rock&lt;/a&gt; band, either in terms of popularity or sound.&amp;nbsp; Is there an ideal venue size for an indie/folk/roots/country/bluegrass band like the Avett Brothers?&amp;nbsp; David Byrne in his &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/david_byrne_how_architecture_helped_music_evolve"&gt;2010 TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100301042056/http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2010/02/021410-valentines-day.html"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;) explored the relationship between venue and music, but did not really explore the idea of an optimum venue size for a particular sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could only find a few uploaded videos from the New Mexico show ("&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvEFRKkshBs"&gt;Love Like The Movies&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABbB-1CvbOo"&gt;Left on Laura, Left on Lisa&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwuYhmPDy-Q"&gt;Laundry Room&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhUCw-2wVpU"&gt;Satan Pulls The Strings&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RINbKWxL9E"&gt;Murder In The City&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RDJGctu5Po"&gt;I Wish I Was&lt;/a&gt;"), and the quality isn't consistently as good as the &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-avett-brothers-raleigh-nc-2014-12.html"&gt;NYE show&lt;/a&gt; I was able to reconstruct. &amp;nbsp; So instead, I'll include a professionally recorded show at the &lt;a href="http://www.aclfestival.com/2014-lineup/"&gt;2014 Austin City Limits Festival&lt;/a&gt; recorded about four months earlier than the NM show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJFD3yJo2Lw" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-avett-brothers/2014/zilker-park-austin-tx-3bcc9c4c.html"&gt;setlist&lt;/a&gt; is available for this as well, and it amounts to about an hour of music (shorter than a headliner concert).&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure if there was more music and it was edited down to an hour, or if their hour simply straddled sunset (the sun appears to go down at the ~45 minute mark).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Apropos to the venue size question above, note at about ~&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJFD3yJo2Lw#t=31m50s"&gt;31:50&lt;/a&gt; how Seth leaves the stage and tries to pump up the audience by running around the WWI style trenches that separates the band from the audience.&amp;nbsp; I get that it's a large, outdoor festival, but that just doesn't seem like the best way to see the Avett Brothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing on this theme, here is a short, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRm4betTfAA"&gt;five song 2015 Austin City Limits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_City_Limits"&gt;TV show&lt;/a&gt; appearance where the venue is small and intimate but the audience appears sedated if not fully dead.&amp;nbsp; Once again it falls to Seth to venture into the crowd and inject some life (~&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRm4betTfAA#t=14m20s"&gt;14:20&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it is just the nature of TV audiences to be lifeless, cf. my review of&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2014/03/wire-on-box-1979-concert.html"&gt;Wire's 1979 concert "On The Box"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I'm very thankful that in years past we have been able to see the Avett Brothers in the &lt;a href="http://www.pavilionconcerts.com/"&gt;Portsmouth Pavillion&lt;/a&gt;, which might be the ideal size (~6500 people) in addition to its absolutely &lt;a href="http://www.portsmouthva.gov/portspix/6/061903-W0029_RT8.jpg"&gt;beautiful outdoor location&lt;/a&gt; right on the Elizabeth River.&amp;nbsp; I'm also glad Herbert and Lisa got to see them even though it's not exactly their thing.&amp;nbsp; So far their &lt;a href="http://www.theavettbrothers.com/tour/"&gt;tour page&lt;/a&gt; doesn't list a return to Portsmouth, but right now there are only a few dates booked for May, June, and July so I would expect more dates to be announced soon.&amp;nbsp; I'm hoping they return to the area and that we're in town for them (we missed them last year for the &lt;a href="http://feministforum.tumblr.com/post/88272263250/power-tour-day-two-the-drive-from-charlotte-nc"&gt;2014 Power Tour&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Between Michele &amp;amp; Chris, Joy, Marilee, and possibly some others we'll be a good chunk of the audience in what might be a perfect venue for them.&amp;nbsp;</content>

Some folks (and protective friends) were angry, and wondered why she took my title and made it into this kind of "girls gone wild" thing....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a musician I have always refrained from criticizing another artist. I was, "Well, good for her." It did bug me a little bit, however, when she said she came up with the idea for the title in a dream. In truth, she wrote it with a team of professional writers and was signed by the very same guy that signed me in 1995. I have not mentioned that in interviews as I don't want to sound bitter or petty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, maybe, if I really think about it, there were a few jealous and pissed-off moments. So here goes, for the first time in an interview: Fuck you Katy Perry, you fucking stupid, maybe 'not good for the gays,' title-thieving, haven't heard much else, so not quite sure if you're talented, fucking little slut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God that felt good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I watched the halftime show, and I liked it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jill Sobule - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FdwUGwasck"&gt;I Kissed A Girl&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Katy Perry - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAp9BKosZXs"&gt;I Kissed A Girl&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.justjared.com/2015/02/01/katy-perrys-super-bowl-halftime-show-2015-video-watch-now/"&gt;Full Super Bowl XLIX Halftime Show &lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Iron Maiden - "Iron Maiden" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342950+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I09IZkJZB2M/VM5-FTwABoI/AAAAAAAABgA/XzT9hHeLGwc/s1600/Iron_Maiden_(album)_cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

is typically credited with inventing the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_of_British_Heavy_Metal"&gt;NWOBHM&lt;/a&gt;), perhaps the most well-known and successful example is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden_%28album%29"&gt;self-titled 1980 debut LP&lt;/a&gt; is the subject of today's post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked Iron Maiden growing up although perhaps not as much as Robert Gordick, my friend &amp;amp; neighbor who was a super fan.&amp;nbsp; But I always held a minority opinion: I prefer the vocals of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Di%27Anno"&gt;Paul Di'Anno&lt;/a&gt; to that of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson"&gt;Bruce Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Di'Anno only appears on the first two LPs (this one and 1981's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_%28Iron_Maiden_album%29"&gt;Killers&lt;/a&gt;") while Dickinson is far more well-known and appears on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden#Success_.281981.E2.80.931985.29"&gt;classic line up&lt;/a&gt; (which, more or less, has been reformed &amp;amp; active since 1999).&amp;nbsp; I don't dislike Dickinson, and I'll be the first to admit that Dickinson is technically a much better singer, but I just prefer the gravelly, growling punk style of Di'Anno.&amp;nbsp; While I have most of the classic-Dickinson LPs on tape somewhere (recorded from Robert Gordick's collection), I only felt compelled to buy the first two LPs on CD later in life.&amp;nbsp; When I was in HS, I preferred "Killers", but over time I've come to prefer "Iron Maiden".&amp;nbsp; Today, I still enjoy both LPs, even without a hint of irony or nostalgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this LP so enjoyable to me is the range of songs &amp;amp; the tight production (this is the only LP in their early years to not feature super-producer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Birch"&gt;Martin Birch&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; "Killers" has an arguably heavier sound, but it is a bit muddy where "Iron Maiden" is pretty crisp.&amp;nbsp; Bassist &amp;amp; primary song writer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harris_(musician)"&gt;Steve Harris&lt;/a&gt; (he &amp;amp; guitarist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Murray_(musician)"&gt;Dave Murray&lt;/a&gt; are the only ones to appear on all Iron Maiden LPs) is clearly the centerpiece here, effectively playing bass as a lead instrument (esp. on "Phantom of the Opera").&amp;nbsp; "Strange World" is a standout while being barely a metal song (without being a sappy ballad), and "Remember Tomorrow" is a rich and complex song as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Di'Anno was kicked out of Iron Maiden in 1981 for substance abuse problems, something I'm not sure he ever really got past.&amp;nbsp; He sang in a lot of bands afterwards but with little critical impact.&amp;nbsp; Of course, post-Di'Anno Iron Maiden went on to become one of the world's most successful and long-lived bands, with the kind of loyal fan base that &lt;a href="http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/lady-gaga-iron-maiden-changed-my-life/"&gt;other artists envy&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Iron Maiden probably would never have achieved their success had they stayed with the unstable Di'Anno, but I still think the first two LPs are their best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs (contemporary live versions): "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB4kelia0HE"&gt;Prowler&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afBRj58PYSI"&gt;Remember Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e86ng1MgTJU"&gt;Running Free&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5jaRipA5_M"&gt;Phantom of the Opera&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCEfqDadlyo"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bweZGtQkpxU"&gt;Strange World&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqb7uhjFTa4"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full LP (use these for studio versions): &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YKblxKglTY"&gt;original 1980 tracklist&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBcdvHfwZjw"&gt;remastered 1998 version&lt;/a&gt; with bonus tracks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 10/10.&amp;nbsp; While Iron Maiden did not get big in the US until "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Number_of_the_Beast_(album)"&gt;The Number of the Beast&lt;/a&gt;", this is probably the first really big NWOBHM LP.&amp;nbsp; While the classic "&lt;a href="http://maidenrevelations.com/2012/10/19/feature-friday-the-birth-of-the-iron-maiden-sound-1980-81/"&gt;Iron Maiden Sound&lt;/a&gt;" wasn't fully developed yet, you can hear it emerging on this LP.&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>The Avett Brothers - Raleigh, NC 2014-12-31 (concert)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342965+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hWYf0y-Ec5k/VKbHE87JdtI/AAAAAAAABfM/7SiboNZ2mbo/s1600/avett-brothers-2014-12-31.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

at the PNC Arena in Raleigh NC on New Years Eve 2014.&amp;nbsp; Since it was NYE and they're from NC, it was an extra long show (~3 hours of music) and they had several special guests, including their sister Bonnie and father Jim.&amp;nbsp; They put on an excellent show, but our seats (section 305) were not very good, as the picture to the left indicates (taken during the end of "Kick Drum Heart", IIRC, where bassist Bob Crawford was so overcome that he just had to sit down to play).&amp;nbsp; We were basically eye-level with the balloons they dropped from the ceiling at midnight.&amp;nbsp; Danette &lt;a href="http://feministforum.tumblr.com/post/106767574410/ringing-in-the-new-year-what-could-be-better"&gt;blogged about the show&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2015/01/01/4443590_avett-brothers-ring-in-2015-in.html"&gt;Raleigh News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/a&gt; had a glowing concert review as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've often wondered that those who film shows on their mobile phones record the moment at the expense of not actually experiencing the moment.&amp;nbsp; It's not something that we typically do (other than a few pics like the above just to prove we were there), but in this case our seats were so bad that various uploaded Youtube videos (some of them recorded quite well) from the show actually let us experience (sort of) what we missed from our seats.&amp;nbsp; Borrowing the &lt;a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-avett-brothers/2014/pnc-arena-raleigh-nc-3bcd58f0.html"&gt;setlist from setlist.fm&lt;/a&gt; (and making some of my own corrections/additions), below is a list of songs from the Avett Brothers 2014 NYE show, with links to the videos where available:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqRTgtkbxos"&gt;Satan Pulls The Strings &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2f-q0MctIw"&gt;Live and Die&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>States - "My Latest Girl" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.342979+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r2RrtZiul3c/VJHosKRHJNI/AAAAAAAABec/mkI_LJc5kV4/s1600/states-latest-girl.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r2RrtZiul3c/VJHosKRHJNI/AAAAAAAABec/mkI_LJc5kV4/s1600/states-latest-girl.jpeg" height="187" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Three years ago (!) I covered Norfolk's States and "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/11/states-picture-me-with-you-forgotten.html"&gt;Picture Me With You&lt;/a&gt;" as a forgotten song.&amp;nbsp; Today, on a whim, I played that song again and in the Youtube recommendations was a song called "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/States-My-Latest-Girl/master/673000"&gt;My Latest Girl&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; The title seemed vaguely familiar so I clicked on it and there it was -- a song I haven't heard in probably 30+ years.&amp;nbsp; I can't remember the room number of my office but I can remember a song title I haven't heard since middle school?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This song is the first single of their 1979 debut LP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/States-The-States/master/441947"&gt;The States&lt;/a&gt;", and the sound is squarely in the late 70s / early 80s, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cars"&gt;Cars&lt;/a&gt;-influenced &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt; genre.&amp;nbsp; I don't remember much about the song, but I assume this is another thing we can credit to the late &lt;a href="http://gangrey.com/?p=3983"&gt;Carol Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and her commitment to local music.&amp;nbsp; Of course at the time, to me it was just "music on the radio" and I didn't really understand the difference between local and national acts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else remember this song from K94 and/or FM99 from back in the day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;States - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYyMxx5-eP0"&gt;My Latest Girl&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Waxahatchee - "American Weekend" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344336+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p5u3K-rNFAw/VEJvS4dhA-I/AAAAAAAABc0/Q0Ls7WVJ26A/s1600/waxahatchee-aw.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p5u3K-rNFAw/VEJvS4dhA-I/AAAAAAAABc0/Q0Ls7WVJ26A/s1600/waxahatchee-aw.jpeg" height="200" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"Crave, desolate, you dive in, we follow along.&lt;br /&gt;I contrive you with whiskey and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cooke"&gt;Sam Cooke&lt;/a&gt; songs&lt;br /&gt;and we lay on our backs, soaking wet&lt;br /&gt;below a static TV set.&lt;br /&gt;Conversation flows, counting shooting stars and catfish,&lt;br /&gt;but I'll never make a wish."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I don't know how many listens, I still get chills from the opening lines to "&lt;a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107859426317/"&gt;Catfish&lt;/a&gt;", the first song on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxahatchee"&gt;Waxahatchee&lt;/a&gt;'s debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Weekend"&gt;American Weekend&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; I did not discover Waxahatchee until the release of the release of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerulean_Salt"&gt;Cerulean Salt&lt;/a&gt;" a year later, and then made my way back to "American Weekend".&amp;nbsp; All the hipsters know the story by now, but here's the short version in case you don't: twins Katie &amp;amp; Allison Crutchfield were in the cleverly named (but terminally underground) band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.S._Eliot"&gt;P.S. Eliot&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; When they broke up in 2011, Allison formed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swearin%27"&gt;Swearin&lt;/a&gt;', and Katie recorded as Waxahatchee during an extended retreat to her parent's lake house on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxahatchee_Creek"&gt;Waxahatchee Creek&lt;/a&gt;, essentially off the grid and far away from everything.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is an intimate, confessional, lo-fi masterpiece.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp; know I've overused the reference to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Phair"&gt;Liz Phair&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girly_Sound"&gt;Girlysound&lt;/a&gt;" tapes, but in this case the reference is unavoidable (and I'm not the only one, see this &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9018-albums-of-the-year-honorable-mention/2/"&gt;Pitchfork review&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; (I suppose I could also compare it to the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Texas_Campfire_Tapes"&gt;Texas Campfire Tapes&lt;/a&gt;", but those references have gone out of style now that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Shocked"&gt;Michelle Shocked&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="http://www.queerty.com/alt-folk-singer-michelle-shocked-goes-on-homophobic-rant-tells-audience-god-hates-fags-20130318"&gt;self-hating traitor&lt;/a&gt;.)&amp;nbsp; I know the idea of a solo, acoustic, coffee house, autobiographical, neo-hippie, female folk singer is a 3rd stage &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith_Fair"&gt;Lilith Fair&lt;/a&gt; cliche, but trust me: Katie's different.&amp;nbsp; There is a unpretentious, wrenching, earnest, piercing sincerity that transcends the sparse, almost harsh recording.&amp;nbsp; Where Liz channeled a battle-of-the-sexes anger borrowed from early &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Benatar"&gt;Pat Benatar&lt;/a&gt;, the villain in Katie's songs is Katie: paralyzed with self-doubt and a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials"&gt;millennial&lt;/a&gt;-flavored self-absorption.&amp;nbsp; Despite this, and the fact that I'm nearly old enough to be her father, the music connects with me, in part because Katie's provided a universal soundtrack for awkward, early 20s relationships (e.g., I'd like to imagine a particular college relationship-but-not-quite-girlfriend addressing me in the manner of "&lt;a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107859426371/"&gt;Bathtub&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107859426318/"&gt;Grass Stain&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's not just romantic relationships that are the subject of Katie's songs.&amp;nbsp; "&lt;a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107859426319/"&gt;Rose, 1956&lt;/a&gt;" is her attempt to fathom the difference in her reality and that of her grandmother (?):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Sharp hangover, it is Christmas Eve.&lt;br /&gt;It fades and evaporates passing the trains and lakes and trees.&lt;br /&gt;Your breaths are short and urgent and it is unsettling.&lt;br /&gt;Cause you got married when you were 15, 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I hide out from telephone wires at Waxahatchee Creek.&lt;br /&gt;Your body, weak from smoke and tar and subsequent disease.&lt;br /&gt;You got married when you were 15, 15.&lt;/blockquote&gt;More insight about Katie and Waxahatchee can be found in this &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9045-waxahatchee/"&gt;interview with Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I can say more about this LP, but then it would be more about me and less about Katie/Waxahatchee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are no bad song on the LP and quite a few live versions on the web, I'm changing the format a bit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107859426317/"&gt;Catfish&lt;/a&gt;" -- &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5ZMsO-iJXo"&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_sa5J7jMeM"&gt;live in Asheville NC&lt;/a&gt;

I reserve the right to adjust this upwards in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to close out the review, here are the closing lyrics to "Catfish".&amp;nbsp; As Danette pointed out, all of the songs "sweat" with subtle Southern cultural references.&amp;nbsp; Although not really the point of this song, it provides color in a way that only those familiar with sticky, Southern nights can appreciate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;We stick to our slow motion memory.&lt;br /&gt;It's 1 in the morning and 90 degrees&lt;br /&gt;and though now it is hovering darkly over me,&lt;br /&gt;it'll look just like heaven when I get up and leave.&lt;br /&gt;You're a ghost&lt;br /&gt;and I can't breathe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Blackstreet - "No Diggity" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344350+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ghtXoisvzDk/VD3fR9-4qgI/AAAAAAAABck/YwLO_MbURDE/s1600/no-diggity.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ghtXoisvzDk/VD3fR9-4qgI/AAAAAAAABck/YwLO_MbURDE/s1600/no-diggity.jpeg" height="200" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This post is for Danette, who absolutely loves the song "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Diggity"&gt;No Diggity&lt;/a&gt;" from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstreet"&gt;Blackstreet&lt;/a&gt;'s 1996 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Level_(Blackstreet_album)"&gt;Another Level&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; I'm not going to save it for a &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2014/09/ani-difranco-32-flavors-forgotten-song.html"&gt;birthday post&lt;/a&gt; for her for obvious reasons: the song is about a guy in love with a prostitute because of her technical proficiency and voracity*.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reminded of this song recently when I heard the 2012 cover by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Faker"&gt;Chet Faker&lt;/a&gt; from his EP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_in_Textures"&gt;Thinking in Textures&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; I'm pretty sure I had seen the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran"&gt;Ed Sheeran&lt;/a&gt; version before, but that doesn't come close to the smooth, downtempo version that Faker turns in.&amp;nbsp; The Faker version also has some interesting percussion towards the end, with the drums emulating the piano (?) sample from the original.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackstreet - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KL9mRus19o"&gt;No Diggity&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Chet Faker - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfFA8-RaHQ"&gt;No Diggity&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1JsBhRCRH0"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;Ed Sheeran - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2K_7-MHt3k"&gt;No Diggity&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;and for completeness #1: "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_Perfect"&gt;Pitch Perfect&lt;/a&gt;" - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqCkJJ_4gpg"&gt;No Diggity&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;completeness #2: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Withers"&gt;Bill Withers&lt;/a&gt; - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDpuXbadiho"&gt;Grandma's Hands&lt;/a&gt;" (which Blackstreet sampled for "No Diggity")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you read the &lt;a href="http://rap.genius.com/Blackstreet-no-diggity-lyrics"&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; I guess it is just a coarser version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police"&gt;The Police&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://rock.genius.com/The-police-roxanne-lyrics"&gt;Roxanne&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Yet I can't help but think about the Chris Rock routine "I Love Rap Music" -- "&lt;a href="http://lit.genius.com/Chris-rock-i-love-rap-music-annotated#note-1515674"&gt;He Ain't Talking About Me!&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcqJDDhoUlc#t=2m40s"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;).</content>

    <title>Ani DiFranco - "32 Flavors" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344364+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xq8v1KmzVOs/VCaf9gb-cGI/AAAAAAAABcQ/7d6WXUaEDVc/s1600/ani-difranco-32.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xq8v1KmzVOs/VCaf9gb-cGI/AAAAAAAABcQ/7d6WXUaEDVc/s1600/ani-difranco-32.png" height="148" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Another song for Danette's birthday!&amp;nbsp; I first heard "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32_Flavors"&gt;32 Flavors&lt;/a&gt;" in early 1998 when &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alana_Davis"&gt;Alana Davis&lt;/a&gt; released it as her first single off her &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame_It_on_Me_(album)"&gt;first LP&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It was a good song and received a good bit of radio airplay, but I soon learned it was originally released by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ani_DiFranco"&gt;Ani DiFranco&lt;/a&gt;, off her &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_a_Pretty_Girl"&gt;1995 LP&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; And although Alana turned in a nice, shorter, radio-friendly version, it does not approach the depth and richness of the original.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early 1998 was right before Danette and I got together, and I had a number of significant life decisions to make.&amp;nbsp; And although Danette never said anything like this to me at the time, I imagined that she did and that's nearly the same thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Squint your eyes and look closer&lt;br /&gt;I'm not between you and your ambition&lt;br /&gt;I am a poster girl with no poster&lt;br /&gt;I am thirty-two flavors and then some&lt;br /&gt;And I'm beyond your peripheral vision&lt;br /&gt;So you might want to turn your head&lt;br /&gt;Cause someday you're going to get hungry&lt;br /&gt;And eat most of the words you just said&lt;/blockquote&gt;And after 16+ years, I can say 32 is a significant underestimate. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ani DiFranco - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_pMYbleHpU"&gt;32 Flavors&lt;/a&gt;" (studio), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVg7mtgEqGY"&gt;32 Flavors&lt;/a&gt;" (live)&lt;br /&gt;Alana Davis - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEfbL53jhN4"&gt;32 Flavors&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous birthday songs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013: The Green Pajamas - "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-green-pajamas-kim-waitress.html"&gt;Kim the Waitress&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;2012: The Cure - "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-cure-high-forgotten-song.html"&gt;High&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;2011: Blink 182 - "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/09/blink-182-josie-forgotten-song.html"&gt;Josie&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;2010:&amp;nbsp; Dead Milkmen - "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/09/dead-milkmen-punk-rock-girl-forgotten.html"&gt;Punk Rock Girl&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>Let's Active - "Every Word Means No" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344378+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQXbEkvNIr4/VB-EU2BDT1I/AAAAAAAABcA/ljR4j1_43MI/s1600/letsactive.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQXbEkvNIr4/VB-EU2BDT1I/AAAAAAAABcA/ljR4j1_43MI/s1600/letsactive.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This installment of "forgotten songs" comes from our friend Hillary, who while at dinner with Danette last week mentioned being a fan of Winston-Salem's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Active"&gt;Let's Active&lt;/a&gt; back in the day.&amp;nbsp; Danette had never heard of them and I only knew that there was a band by that name (probably via Terry).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some poking around and their first real song was "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvuetnVoxIs"&gt;Every Word Means No&lt;/a&gt;", from their 1983 EP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afoot"&gt;Afoot&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; The song sounds vaguely familiar, but I'm not sure if I actually remember it or if, sounding like a cross between &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M."&gt;R.E.M.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Connells"&gt;The Connells&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; it is just representative of the early- to mid-80s college sound.&amp;nbsp; The connection with R.E.M. is not accidental -- guitarist and vocalist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Easter"&gt;Mitch Easte&lt;/a&gt;r produced the first two R.E.M. LPs (as well as other bands) for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.R.S._Records"&gt;I.R.S. Records&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of band that fleshes out a musical scene, even if they are overshadowed by the scene's more central bands.&amp;nbsp; So is it new, overlooked, or simply forgotten?&amp;nbsp; In the car collecting world, we'd call this "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_old_stock"&gt;new old stock&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Enjoy like its 1983.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's Active -- "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvuetnVoxIs"&gt;Every Word Means No&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After poking around some more, I'm pretty sure I remember their 1989 song "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzIX6ZOQlq8"&gt;Every Dog Has His Day&lt;/a&gt;", even though I could not have told you it was by Let's Active.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, "Every Word Means No" is a better song.</content>

    <title>The Specials - "Rock Goes to College (1979)" (concert)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344392+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vu8qBmqjqrI/U_EWJ5skF-I/AAAAAAAABa8/bJlofbq8PMw/s1600/the-specials-rgtc.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vu8qBmqjqrI/U_EWJ5skF-I/AAAAAAAABa8/bJlofbq8PMw/s1600/the-specials-rgtc.png" height="157" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A couple of weeks ago, Mat and I were driving back from DC and searching for common interests on the ipod.&amp;nbsp; Enter &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials"&gt;The Specials&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp; We made it through their first two LPs, both of which I plan to review some day.&amp;nbsp; In the interim, I found this great concert footage recorded in late 1979 and aired in early 1980.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the BBC (and NPR-types like myself just love the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;) had a four year series (1978-1981) called "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Goes_to_College"&gt;Rock Goes To College&lt;/a&gt;", where up and coming bands played at college venues in the UK.&amp;nbsp; Few of these concerts are available in any format now (cf. the &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/02/pink-floyd-hour-with-pink-floyd-kqed-lp.html"&gt;Pink Floyd 1970 KQED concert&lt;/a&gt;), but fortunately The Specials concert exists on YouTube.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert is early in their career, drawing from their first &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials_(album)"&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Special_AKA_Live!"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Specials-Gangsters/release/1829699"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The track list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Dawning of a) New Era &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do the Dog &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monkey Man &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rat Race&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blank Expression&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rude Boys Outta Jail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doesn't Make it Alright&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concrete Jungle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too Much Too Young&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guns of Navarone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nite Klub&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gangsters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longshot Kick de Bucket&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Madness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're Wondering Now&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cXZfi4bVjD8" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fun 1979 time capsule from a great band (check out audience on stage at the end).&amp;nbsp; And in an interesting cross over with the archival aspect of my professional career, if you study all &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Goes_to_College#Episodes"&gt;the other episodes&lt;/a&gt; that were broadcast you'll be hoping they surface some time too.&amp;nbsp; Hey BBC, open up your archives!</content>

    <title>We Were Promised Jetpacks - "Live in Nashville, 2012-03-29" (concert)</title>

    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xV0oao3Zm9k/U7wZhZG0b6I/AAAAAAAABX0/6q9MEz7sTJs/s1600/wwpj-2012-03-29.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="110" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xV0oao3Zm9k/U7wZhZG0b6I/AAAAAAAABX0/6q9MEz7sTJs/s1600/wwpj-2012-03-29.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Following on from the previous review of "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2014/07/we-were-promised-jetpacks-these-four.html"&gt;These Four Walls&lt;/a&gt;", I wanted to share this excellent hour-long concert video of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Were_Promised_Jetpacks"&gt;We Were Promised Jetpacks&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There is no shortage of live videos of WWPJ on Youtube, but I especially like this one camera shoot of their March 29, 2012 show in Nashville.&amp;nbsp; With only minimal panning or zooming, it nicely complements the "jeans &amp;amp; t-shirt" lo-fi sound of the band.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band itself is in fine form, reworking many of the songs with a different sound from the LP versions while still sounding crisp.&amp;nbsp; For example, they offer a completely different and extended version of "A Half Built House", this time serving as an intro to "Keeping Warm" (starting at about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYg6zRif5s#t=17m10s"&gt;17:10&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; There is even a nice bit of (nearly) a capella singing at about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cYg6zRif5s#t=38m10s"&gt;38:10&lt;/a&gt; (I'm not sure of the song (edit: it's "Sore Thumb" from "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Pit_of_the_Stomach"&gt;In the Pit of the Stomach&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1cYg6zRif5s" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOM1o8Cerwxp4LaLWvvjfww"&gt;palabra17&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://new.livestream.com/exitin"&gt;exitin&lt;/a&gt; for sharing this.</content>

    <title>We Were Promised Jetpacks - "These Four Walls" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344478+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ha9yLsb9WrY/U7mQZhGWHxI/AAAAAAAABXk/QfUSduWbOUc/s1600/wwpj-these-four-walls.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ha9yLsb9WrY/U7mQZhGWHxI/AAAAAAAABXk/QfUSduWbOUc/s1600/wwpj-these-four-walls.jpeg" height="199" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I wish I had a better story of my discovery of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Were_Promised_Jetpacks"&gt;We Were Promised Jetpacks&lt;/a&gt;...&amp;nbsp; Perhaps a recommendation from one of my well-connected friends (Butch, Terry, Herbert, Johan, Joy, Scott, etc.), or hearing them at a small club while on travel, or some connection to &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/The%20Cribs"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt;, or something equally cool.&amp;nbsp; Instead, I first heard them in the soundtrack of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_Pass"&gt;Hall Pass&lt;/a&gt;", which featured the song "Quiet Little Voices" as the otherwise bland film's most memorable moment.&amp;nbsp; From the little snippet of lyrics I heard ("I'm young again..."), it took me a while to determine the artist and song, but afterwards I quickly sampled some of their other music and then ordered their debut 2009 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Four_Walls_%28We_Were_Promised_Jetpacks_album%29"&gt;These Four Walls&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't been disappointed.&amp;nbsp; WWPJ works the &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449121/"&gt;Pixies loud-soft-loud formula&lt;/a&gt; to perfection, and their Scottish burr makes it sound all the better (e.g., "beh-her star-ah naow" --&amp;gt; "better start now").&amp;nbsp; I think there is a rule that all reviews of WWPJ must compare them to fellow Scotts &amp;amp; label mates "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frightened_Rabbit"&gt;Frightened Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;" (e.g., the &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/these-four-walls-mw0000820928"&gt;Allmusic review&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; I realize I discovered WWPJ first, but after several listenings of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Organ_Fight"&gt;The Midnight Organ Fight&lt;/a&gt;", I can say WWPJ rawks much harder than FR.&amp;nbsp; In fact, that might be what I like best about this LP: this is basically a metal LP for grown ups.&amp;nbsp; And I don't mean that in an alt-metal, later &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Queensryche"&gt;Queensryche&lt;/a&gt; Pink-Floyd-wannabe kind of way, but rather in a more Pixies or Weezer kind of way, but without the wry humor.&amp;nbsp; For example, when Frank Black sings "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debaser"&gt;Got me a movie / I want you to know/ Slicin' up eyeballs / I want you to know&lt;/a&gt;", its playful and mischievous.&amp;nbsp; But it is just disturbing when Adam Thompson sings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Somethings happened in the attic,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;There's no way I am going up there,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Somethings happened in the attic,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;We both know I'm not going up there,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Somethings happened in the attic,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;This is my house, This is my home&amp;nbsp; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Lyrically, many of the songs have a creepy ambiguity between the victim and antagonist.&amp;nbsp; Musically, it is more like metal (albeit with a melodic pop sensibility), with an almost martial, heavily structured and almost formal progression from segment to segment.&amp;nbsp; Listen to "It's Thunder and It's Lightning" and how the tension builds from 1:20-3:10 on the way to the chorus.&amp;nbsp; That's not how punk songs are structured (the Pixies would never take two minutes to reach their destination); that's pure metal.&amp;nbsp; Weezer occasionally does that with songs like "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_in_Dreams_%28song%29"&gt;Only In Dreams&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose an unkind review could say WWPJ has just written the same song 11 times.&amp;nbsp; Sure, there is a formula here but who cares when the formula is this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWQjwt9iUrQ"&gt;It's Thunder and It's Lightning&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n21e23KzWjY"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOC9L-qDPqE"&gt;Ships With Holes Will Sink&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Topzx9TdOLg"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jubzFhDAK68"&gt;A Half Built House&lt;/a&gt;" / "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32p5L_XwD4U"&gt;This Is My House, This Is My Home&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmqlqUaoRRs"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ZhBAylbN4"&gt;Quiet Little Voices&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN9cgAr-6F4"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMnVagy4ruo"&gt;Short Bursts&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.muzu.tv/we-were-promised-jetpacks/we-were-promised-jetpacks-short-bursts-flytv-in-the-courtyard-video/275814/"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs-npoliHlc"&gt;Keeping Warm&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hsgf7ZNJXc"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10.&amp;nbsp; I considered giving it an "8", but the best songs just don't wear out. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: KEXP has a link to an MP3 of "&lt;a href="http://blog.kexp.org/2008/05/20/song-of-the-day-we-were-promised-jetpacks-quiet-little-voices/"&gt;Quiet Little Voices&lt;/a&gt;" (this is either the EP version or a live version, I'm not sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gratuitous "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer"&gt;OK Computer&lt;/a&gt;" link: In my book, "A Half-Built House" sounds like the guitar version of "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laoq1eeIUxQ"&gt;Fitter Happier&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp;

    <title>Camera Obscura - "My Maudlin Career" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344492+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GGU611fjj4g/U6xHKSTOKLI/AAAAAAAABXU/Z_cPylTEZWw/s1600/camera-obscura-maudlin.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GGU611fjj4g/U6xHKSTOKLI/AAAAAAAABXU/Z_cPylTEZWw/s1600/camera-obscura-maudlin.jpeg" height="200" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My fascination with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_Obscura_(band)"&gt;Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt; continues; they're still perhaps the biggest cult band that you've never heard of.&amp;nbsp; 2009 saw the release of their fourth studio LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Maudlin_Career"&gt;My Maudlin Career&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; I have to confess that I was disappointed at first, especially considering how much I loved their prior LP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/07/camera-obscura-lets-get-out-of-this.html"&gt;Let's Get Out Of This Country&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; The lead single and the LP's opening song, "French Navy", might be their strongest song ever, but after that the LP treads water.&amp;nbsp; While none of the songs are bad -- some are even quite good -- it just doesn't come together as well as their prior LPs even though all the standard Camera Obscura motifs are present. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, Camera Obscura treading water is still better than most bands and after repeated listening my opinion of this LP has improved.&amp;nbsp; In &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Camera%20Obscura"&gt;prior reviews&lt;/a&gt; I've struggled to describe their sound with terms like "NPR indie rock" and "pop songs for adults", so I won't try further here.&amp;nbsp; Even though it might be their weakest LP to date, it should still be in your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3CkfvYMCWM"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt;" (if you listen to only one Camera Obscura song in your life, make it "French Navy"), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSanTYPm2g"&gt;Sweetest Thing&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY7JjDsfzN4"&gt;Swans&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku2epT_e-F0"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpxyIymzzA4"&gt;My Maudlin Career&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfDg7Vz8Ow4"&gt;Honey in the Sun&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final rating: 7/10.&amp;nbsp; On a good day I'd give it an 8/10, but I sure would like at least one more song with a hook as strong as "French Navy".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus live links (incomplete, there are many more):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;French Navy: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqpPdn31nuo"&gt;Craig Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJT3UZTyzes"&gt;Morning Becomes Eclectic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Sweetest Thing: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpelM5OitY8"&gt;Baebel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swans: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PokYN1hgWec"&gt;Morning Becomes Eclectic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H378xwnfEKc"&gt;acoustic in the CO tour bus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;James: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7XRVF2bcms"&gt;Morning Becomes Eclectic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My Maudlin Career: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmPzYztFmSo"&gt;The Glass House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honey in the Sun: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFEG6xWLrzs"&gt;Morning Becomes Eclectic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Ultravox - "Vienna" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344506+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-3f1_OvRMw/U2faH8M2IwI/AAAAAAAABU4/YZ5K9YBVTlg/s1600/ultravox-vienna-single.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-3f1_OvRMw/U2faH8M2IwI/AAAAAAAABU4/YZ5K9YBVTlg/s1600/ultravox-vienna-single.jpeg" height="200" width="198" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I helped Danette pick up a rental car yesterday and it had satellite radio (her favorite car feature and one we don't have on our daily drivers).&amp;nbsp; As I bounced around the stations, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultravox"&gt;Ultravox&lt;/a&gt;'s 1981 single "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_%28Ultravox_song%29"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;", the title track from their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_%28album%29"&gt;1980 LP&lt;/a&gt;, came on &lt;a href="http://www.siriusxm.com/1stwave"&gt;1st wave&lt;/a&gt; which is one of our favorite satellite radio stations because it features alternative 80s songs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only the vaguest memory of "Vienna" from the early MTV period and I'm almost certain it did not receive radio airplay.&amp;nbsp; I can't remember the last time I heard this song -- it must have been 30+ years.&amp;nbsp; It sounds just a bit dated (sort of a synth pop version of Joy Division's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/07/joy-division-atmosphere-song-remains.html"&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;"), but altogether has held up surprisingly well.&amp;nbsp; I don't really know that much about Ultravox other than 1) they exist and 2) their European success never really crossed over to the US like their contemporaries such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Psychedelic_Furs"&gt;The Furs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_English_%28band%29"&gt;Modern English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This means nothing to me..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultravox - "Vienna" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DuCIGvsbMA"&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHojqzsx96E"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;)</content>

    <title>Queen &amp; David Bowie - "Under Pressure" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344520+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cfLEkDEX7hg/U2Ub_NakIDI/AAAAAAAABUo/uwg8TQHxel0/s1600/under-pressure.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cfLEkDEX7hg/U2Ub_NakIDI/AAAAAAAABUo/uwg8TQHxel0/s1600/under-pressure.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With arguably the world's most recognizable bass line (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ice_Baby"&gt;somewhat unfortunately&lt;/a&gt;), the 1981 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie"&gt;David Bowie&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt; collaboration "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Pressure"&gt;Under Pressure&lt;/a&gt;" might be my personal favorite song from Queen or David Bowie.&amp;nbsp; Although I respect both, I've never been a huge fan of either, and on this song I think the balance each other out and the result works, musically and lyrically.&amp;nbsp; Even the video was a welcome break from de rigueur&amp;nbsp; lip synced, faux-concert videos of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my surprise when I stumbled across this 2011 version by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt;, live in the studio.&amp;nbsp; To the best of my knowledge, it isn't on any of their official releases and is just a knockabout version they did for a music web site.&amp;nbsp; There is no shortage of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Pressure#Other_cover_versions"&gt;cover versions of this song&lt;/a&gt;, but it does seem like a bit of a departure for The Cribs, who favor more obscure covers by cult bands like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Replacements_%28band%29"&gt;The Replacements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Chiefs"&gt;The Kaiser Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Gain"&gt;Comet Gain&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queen &amp;amp; David Bowie: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qVl8Gb2J4"&gt;Under Pressure&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMQb9LCNGxs"&gt;a cappella&lt;/a&gt; version)&lt;br /&gt;The Cribs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIEf5Jqa-C0"&gt;Under Pressure&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>Times New Viking - "Dancer Equired!" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344534+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ZtNbMZHk7o/U1KG7k7Tc0I/AAAAAAAABTw/pLU6uBuhMhM/s1600/tnv-dancer-equired.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ZtNbMZHk7o/U1KG7k7Tc0I/AAAAAAAABTw/pLU6uBuhMhM/s1600/tnv-dancer-equired.jpeg" height="200" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Underneath all the lo-fi fuzz, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Viking"&gt;Times New Viking&lt;/a&gt; provides surprisingly strong pop songs.&amp;nbsp; Their 2011 LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancer_Equired!"&gt;Dancer Equired!&lt;/a&gt;", is the only release of theirs I have, but apparently they experienced some backlash for it being "too polished" compared to their earlier works (for example, the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15357-dancer-equired/"&gt;Pitchfork review&lt;/a&gt; starts with "There were whispers that this might happen...").&amp;nbsp; Most of the reviews I've read compare their sound to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_by_Voices"&gt;Guided By Voices&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm only a little familiar with them.&amp;nbsp; To me, TNV are evocative of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Happening"&gt;Beat Happening&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Records"&gt;K Records&lt;/a&gt; sound.&amp;nbsp; Or perhaps the aural equivalent of Kevin Smith's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerks"&gt;Clerks&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, their fuzzy &amp;amp; purposefully slightly out of tune sound is endearing, fun, and addictive.&amp;nbsp; On songs like "Ever Falling In Love", you ask yourself "is it polyphony or are Jared Phillips and Beth Murphy singing two completely different songs?"&amp;nbsp; I guess the former since it all works beautifully.&amp;nbsp; There are no bad moments, but the last five tracks (starting with "Don't Go to Liverpool") close out the LP in especially fine form.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lng_509tug"&gt;It’s a Culture&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ngxwJZtNt4"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRP2pxNtGZ0"&gt;Ever Falling in Love&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTJHIfiAKzc"&gt;No Room to Live&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drMcejo09Wc"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsslWKfsiO4"&gt;Try Harder&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5STLejw59A"&gt;Don't Go To Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqnCU-Aq1Jo"&gt;alternate video&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04_RHFPV3qo"&gt;Fuck Her Tears&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL_WavOAWM0"&gt;Want to Exist&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PBAHIdHFgU"&gt;Somebody’s Slave&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://amazingtunes.com/wichitarecordings/tunes/72097"&gt;No Good&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me05n325HmE"&gt;LP Trailer&lt;/a&gt; from Merge Records, and a short 2012 documentary from Pitchfork called "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbZPI96IZD8"&gt;Do Not Do It Yourself&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>GWAR - "Phallus in Wonderland" (spotlight)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344562+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w0m7UUFDwnU/Uzb1YlDlGvI/AAAAAAAABSs/StcjHAwKBe0/s1600/gwar-piw.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w0m7UUFDwnU/Uzb1YlDlGvI/AAAAAAAABSs/StcjHAwKBe0/s1600/gwar-piw.jpeg" height="200" width="133" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Dave Brockie, aka "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oderus_Urungus"&gt;Oderus Urungus&lt;/a&gt;", a founding member of Gwar &lt;a href="http://wtvr.com/2014/03/24/gwar-founder-dave-brockie-found-dead-in-richmond-home/"&gt;died this week&lt;/a&gt; in Richmond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwar"&gt;Gwar&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Other than it is possibly short for "Gwaaarrrgghhlllgh".&amp;nbsp; With Gwar, you either get the joke or you don't; Gwar is equal parts band, performance art, long-running (~30 years) inside-joke, and social commentary.&amp;nbsp; It's like they combined &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_%28band%29"&gt;KISS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallagher_%28comedian%29"&gt;Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Spinal_Tap"&gt;This Is Spinal Tap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindhouse"&gt;grindhouse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He-Man_and_the_Masters_of_the_Universe"&gt;He-Man and the Masters of The Universe&lt;/a&gt; and decided "that's a good start, but what would happen if we took it to 11?"&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry first introduced me to Gwar.&amp;nbsp; He was pretty plugged into the VA music scene during the 90s and I'm pretty sure he's visited Gwar's headquarters, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Pit_Records"&gt;The Slave Pit&lt;/a&gt;, in Richmond where they made their costumes, filmed their videos, held GWAR-B-Qs, etc.&amp;nbsp; I was always simultaneously proud that something as odd as Gwar would come from VA, and sad that VA is such a religiously conformist environment that it would effectively create a backlash like Gwar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IIRC, Terry told me that Gwar was advanced a small amount of $ to make a music video but instead they made an hour long movie.&amp;nbsp; That would be 1992's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallus_in_Wonderland"&gt;Phallus in Wonderland&lt;/a&gt;", which is now out of print and Terry's copy is probably worth a good bit. The plot: the "Morality Squad" steals Oderus's "Cuttlefish of Cthulu" and Gwar creates the T-Rex "Gor-Gor" to get it back.&amp;nbsp; I'd say it makes sense in context but, again, you either get the joke or you don't:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UZNUwLqBkG8" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never saw Gwar live, although we occasionally had a chance when they played at the Norva.&amp;nbsp; I hope they continue, but the future of Gwar is still up in the air.&amp;nbsp; They play in costume, but knowing that Dave Brockie isn't there would somehow lessen the experience.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't have time for the full movie?&amp;nbsp; At the 21 minute mark is "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZNUwLqBkG8#t=21m00s"&gt;Have you seen me?&lt;/a&gt;", their "tribute" to missing children on milk cartons.&amp;nbsp; If you can make it through that, you'll enjoy the rest of their canon.</content>

    <title>Mission of Burma - "Signals, Calls, and Marches" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344577+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DijwLxzYO64/UzVzao47OyI/AAAAAAAABSc/RnDJZTcXmSU/s1600/mob-signals.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DijwLxzYO64/UzVzao47OyI/AAAAAAAABSc/RnDJZTcXmSU/s1600/mob-signals.jpg" height="200" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For my 200th post on F-Measure, I'm covering something simultaneously new, old, and timeless.&amp;nbsp; One of the pleasant finds from my recent reading of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life"&gt;Our Band Could Be Your Life&lt;/a&gt;" was Boston's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_of_Burma"&gt;Mission of Burma&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I have a vague memory of Terry talking about them while we were in college, and I knew a band by that name existed, but I don't remember actually listening to them at the time.&amp;nbsp; Part of the problem is they essentially broke up in 1983 after two landmark releases, a result of guitarist Roger Miller's tinnitus.&amp;nbsp; They reformed in 2002, but had largely missed out on the scene they so heavily influenced.&amp;nbsp; In doing so, they nicely illustrate the difference between "popular" and "influential".&amp;nbsp; Example: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam"&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt;'s 1993's LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vs._%28Pearl_Jam_album%29"&gt;Vs.&lt;/a&gt;" is named in honor to Mission of Burma's 1982 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vs._%28Mission_of_Burma_album%29"&gt;Vs.&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As influential as "Vs." was, my personal favorite is their 1981 debut EP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals,_Calls,_and_Marches"&gt;Signals, Calls, and Marches&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind that I discovered it some 30 years after its debut, but it still sounds fresh and relevant today.&amp;nbsp; It occupies the transitional space between early 80s "punk" and "college alternative" in a way that contemporaries like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Kennedys"&gt;Dead Kennedys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Threat"&gt;Minor Threat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Flag_%28band%29"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;, and other candidates simply don't.&amp;nbsp; Part of it is their strong song writing (with hooks!), without compromising their heaviness and anger, and intelligent lyrics.&amp;nbsp; Another dimension is member Martin Swope, credited as "tape manipulator/sound engineer", who used techniques you'd associate more with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd#Sonic_experimentation"&gt;early 70s Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt; to add a rich but subtle extra dimension to an otherwise sparse, angular punk sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while this is over 30 years old, I just "discovered" it within the last year. &amp;nbsp; Give it a listen: it will sound both new and familiar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8piMHsOya4"&gt;That's When I Reach For My Revolver&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi2vokg7ZlQ"&gt;Fame and Fortune&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eguq53eOWmI"&gt;This Is Not a Photograph&lt;/a&gt;",  "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIif_koMGZA"&gt;All World Cowboy Romance&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXkZI7WZWOo"&gt;Academy Fight Song&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 9/10&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: the entire, original &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh3IudTC3iw"&gt;six song EP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links to covers: Moby - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0v9a-x45gw"&gt;That's When I Reach For My Revolver&lt;/a&gt;", R.E.M. - "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2yXvZzSbBM"&gt;Academy Fight Song&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; While: 1) I have much respect for both &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby"&gt;Moby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M."&gt;R.E.M.&lt;/a&gt;, and 2) I love covers... -- let's just say these versions underscore how good the originals are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: my copy of the CD is the 1997 Ryko re-release which adds their 1980 &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Mission-Of-Burma-Academy-Fight-Song/release/470094"&gt;7" single "Academy Fight Song"&lt;/a&gt; to the end of the original EP, so that's what I review here.&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>Neil Young and Devo - "Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)" (forgotten song)</title>

    <title>Stevie Wonder - "Higher Ground" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344605+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ooUTjChP24A/UvaH_idX3oI/AAAAAAAABRU/3S39emTvYlU/s1600/stevie-wonder-higher-ground.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ooUTjChP24A/UvaH_idX3oI/AAAAAAAABRU/3S39emTvYlU/s1600/stevie-wonder-higher-ground.jpeg" height="197" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Super Bowl was last weekend, and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVIII_halftime_show"&gt;half time show&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Mars"&gt;Bruno Mars&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers"&gt;The Red Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a&gt; guesting.&amp;nbsp; Bruno Mars did a fine job, but...&amp;nbsp; he's not really my thing.&amp;nbsp; I doubt Bruno is losing any sleep over this since, being old enough to rent a car,&amp;nbsp; I'm not his target demographic.&amp;nbsp; I also suppose that's why the Chili Peppers were brought in for a guest spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, they only did one song, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_It_Away_(Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_song)"&gt;Give It Away&lt;/a&gt;", and while that is certainly their most popular song, I was hoping that Stevie Wonder would be a surprise guest...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I recently said that "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2014/01/squeeze-up-junction-forgotten-song.html"&gt;Singles -- 45s and Under&lt;/a&gt;" was standard issue in college, well the Chili Pepper's 1989 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Milk"&gt;Mother's Milk&lt;/a&gt;" might have been #2 on the list.&amp;nbsp; The first single from that LP, and the song that really made them popular, was a cover of Stevie Wonder's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Ground_(Stevie_Wonder_song)"&gt;Higher Ground&lt;/a&gt;", which first appeared on his 1973 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innervisions"&gt;Innervisions&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even if Stevie couldn't make the Super Bowl (note that he's been at the recent &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56th_Annual_Grammy_Awards#Performers"&gt;Grammys&lt;/a&gt; and the Beatle's Tribute concert), including Stevie Wonder via a cover would have better united Bruno Mars and the Chili Peppers.&amp;nbsp; In summary, not a bad half time show (although ending on a ballad was anti-climatic) but omitting "Higher Ground" felt like a missed opportunity.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stevie Wonder - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X00XdLhFLSg"&gt;Higher Ground&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV1DK9tSHio"&gt;live 1974&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Hot Chili Peppers - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ADTPb2f_44"&gt;Higher Ground&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&amp;nbsp; Flea has admitted that, like the Broncos, &lt;a href="http://redhotchilipeppers.com/news/454-a-message-from-flea"&gt;they didn't really play&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>The Everly Brothers - "Cathy's Clown" (spotlight)</title>

    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SHzVPCWu5_8/UvZnNv2re0I/AAAAAAAABQ0/HKkX4qVwXYY/s1600/everly-brothers-cathys-clown.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SHzVPCWu5_8/UvZnNv2re0I/AAAAAAAABQ0/HKkX4qVwXYY/s1600/everly-brothers-cathys-clown.jpeg" height="200" width="198" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm just over a month late, but I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Phil Everly, one-half of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Everly_Brothers"&gt;The Everly Brothers&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If you're tracing the history of rock and roll, the line between Elvis Presley (the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockabilly"&gt;rockabilly&lt;/a&gt; sound) and The Beatles (and their early vocal harmonies) passes through The Everly Brothers.&amp;nbsp; Since their distinctive vocals yielded 26 Top 40 singles in their career, you can't really claim that they were overlooked, but they are certainly overshadowed now by Elvis and The Beatles.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_the_Everly_Brothers"&gt;During their career&lt;/a&gt; they made famous songs written by others (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_Little_Susie"&gt;Wake Up Little Susie&lt;/a&gt;") as well as writing songs that others would successfully cover (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Will_I_Be_Loved_%28song%29"&gt;When Will I Be Loved&lt;/a&gt;"), but my favorite is probably their 1960 hit "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy%27s_Clown"&gt;Cathy's Clown&lt;/a&gt;", which: they wrote themselves, was never popularized by others, and had a &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25608321"&gt;direct influence on The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Cathy's Clown":&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3-E9JebDtU"&gt;TV July 9th, 1960&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpgo3Lkns5s"&gt;UK TV 1961&lt;/a&gt; (backed by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crickets"&gt;The Crickets&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;In both videos Phil is on the left; also Don sings the lead and Phil sings on the harmonies / chorus.</content>

Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)&lt;/a&gt;", made famous by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds"&gt;The Byrds&lt;/a&gt; in 1965 and still heard on classic rock radio today.&amp;nbsp; Sure, I knew about &lt;a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28King_James%29/Ecclesiastes#Chapter_3" title="s:Bible (King James)/Ecclesiastes"&gt;Ecclesiastes&lt;/a&gt;, but I guess I just assumed it was arranged by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McGuinn"&gt;Roger McQuinn&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There are innumerable covers of this song, but the words "turn turn turn" make me hear McQuinn's jangly 12 string...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Seeger - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivshYkrNWrg"&gt;Turn! Turn! Turn!&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;The Byrds - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4ga_M5Zdn4"&gt;Turn! Turn! Turn!&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* OK, that's a small lie.&amp;nbsp; I really don't like "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I_Had_a_Hammer"&gt;If I Had A Hammer&lt;/a&gt;"...</content>

    <title>Squeeze - "Up The Junction" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344661+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xCOOrXtr4hk/UtrJUbWKjPI/AAAAAAAABQM/G7OhlBcjjGA/s1600/squeeze-utj.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xCOOrXtr4hk/UtrJUbWKjPI/AAAAAAAABQM/G7OhlBcjjGA/s1600/squeeze-utj.jpeg" height="196" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_the_Junction_%28song%29"&gt;Up The Junction&lt;/a&gt;", from the 1979 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_for_Cats_(album)"&gt;Cool For Cats&lt;/a&gt;", is probably my favorite &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_(band)"&gt;Squeeze&lt;/a&gt; song, but up until yesterday I had never actually googled the phrase.&amp;nbsp; I was surprised to learn that "Up The Junction" is a 1963 collection of short stories describing dead-end, working class life in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea"&gt;Battersea&lt;/a&gt;, where the railway station &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapham_Junction"&gt;Clapham Junction&lt;/a&gt; is located.&amp;nbsp; It was also adapted as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_the_Junction_(The_Wednesday_Play)"&gt;play in 1965&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_the_Junction_(film)"&gt;film in 1968&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; These would have been well-known cultural references in 1979 in the UK.&amp;nbsp; Presumably the rather bleak story ("&lt;a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858500430/"&gt;The devil came and took me / from bar to street to bookie&lt;/a&gt;") told in the song is taken from the book, but I don't know for sure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't recall Squeeze being famous in the US until a few years later, with songs like "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempted_%28Squeeze_song%29"&gt;Tempted&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Coffee_in_Bed"&gt;Black Coffee in Bed&lt;/a&gt;", but the compilation LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles_%E2%80%93_45%27s_and_Under"&gt;Singles -- 45s and Under&lt;/a&gt;" was standard issue in every dorm room during my college years.&amp;nbsp; But somehow I waited until 2014 to learn the full context of this song...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squeeze - "Up The Junction": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQciegmLPAo"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7DRq7_5sQs"&gt;Top of the Pops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOgWO73ZB1Q"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt; (20xx?), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeRQiK63Rho"&gt;re-recorded 2010 version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nvZ0weUT1o"&gt;1965 BBC play&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Camera Obscura - "Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344675+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CjGTAMeHzSs/UsWv3bPTiLI/AAAAAAAABPQ/0pdq8wpdnMI/s1600/camera-obscura-bbhifi.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="198" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CjGTAMeHzSs/UsWv3bPTiLI/AAAAAAAABPQ/0pdq8wpdnMI/s200/camera-obscura-bbhifi.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Several years ago I rated &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_Obscura_%28band%29"&gt;Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/07/camera-obscura-lets-get-out-of-this.html"&gt;Let's Get Out of This Country&lt;/a&gt;" a perfect 10, and the perfection of that LP overshadowed the two previous LPs (I didn't discover the band until 2009).&amp;nbsp; Now that I've had some time to reflect on it, I have to say their 2001 debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biggest_Bluest_Hi_Fi"&gt;Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi&lt;/a&gt;" is awfully good in its own right.&amp;nbsp; Not as good as LGOOTC but still pretty good, and as I've said before: the iTunes play counts don't lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This LP doesn't offer the same variety of musical styles that LGOOTC presented, but they completely lock down the genre of "pop music for adults"*.&amp;nbsp; I think there is a rule that any discussion of Camera Obscura has to mention fellow Glaswegians &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_%26_Sebastian"&gt;Belle &amp;amp; Sebastian&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; While I recognize that Belle &amp;amp; Sebastian were first in this genre, but for my money Camera Obscura is a lot more enjoyable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One difference between this LP and LGOOTC is that although singer/songwriter/guitarist Tracyanne Campbell was still the center of the band, John Henderson (vocals/percurssion) was featured more prominently, in both duets ("Swimming Pool", "Anti-Western", "Double Feature") as well as lead vocals ("Houseboat").&amp;nbsp; Henderson left the band in 2004 and the supporting male vocal role was taken up by Kenny McKeeve, but in a diminished capacity relative to what we see in their first LP.&amp;nbsp; I love Tracyanne, but&amp;nbsp; Tracyanne &amp;amp; John both singing is pretty hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a perfect world, Camera Obscura would be a hugely successful band and "Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi" would be in the CD collection of every NPR listener under 50.&amp;nbsp; Not convinced?&amp;nbsp; Look at the cover art again, and then listen to the song "Double Feature":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Close comes this winter&lt;br /&gt;Summer is no longer&lt;br /&gt;And things, they seem much bleaker&lt;br /&gt;We'll see a Catherine Deneuve double feature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TC: And our lives&lt;br /&gt;JH: (Double feature, you will survive)&lt;br /&gt;TC: will fade&lt;br /&gt;JH: (Last forever so rest your eyes)&lt;br /&gt;TC: as in darkness&lt;br /&gt;JH: (Play with words when we cannot sing)&lt;br /&gt;TC: we will bathe&lt;br /&gt;JH: (This double feature means everything)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The question you should be asking yourself is "Why isn't &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Deneuve"&gt;Catherine Deneuve&lt;/a&gt; in dozens of pop songs?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: saying "all" would be cheating, so I'll go with: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulnzKT1yrm4"&gt;Eighties Fan&lt;/a&gt;" (the only "official" video from the LP), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9NjNuM4omA"&gt;Happy New Year&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwIOiTJTfNI"&gt;Houseboat&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKJ1meQY_JY"&gt;Anti-Western&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzB_6gero1Q"&gt;The Sun on His Back&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEdETqNEp5o"&gt;Double Feature&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp; (listen to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ALBTKoXRg38BDLMleG9n8pMw1E7gh-zZ8-"&gt;this YouTube playlist&lt;/a&gt; for all the songs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* One important exception: am I the only one that thinks the closing instrumental "Arrangements of Shapes and Space" sounds like the Texas-based, "post-rock" band &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Explosions%20in%20the%20Sky"&gt;Explosions in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Pink Floyd - "Live At Pompeii" (concert)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344716+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cc9pMKy-qe0/Uoj43CJWTpI/AAAAAAAABM8/yCsDV685hg0/s1600/pink-floyd-live-at-pompeii.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="145" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cc9pMKy-qe0/Uoj43CJWTpI/AAAAAAAABM8/yCsDV685hg0/s200/pink-floyd-live-at-pompeii.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I own well-worn copies on VHS and DVD, but at work I've recently been playing Youtube versions of Pink Floyd's 1972 concert film "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd:_Live_at_Pompeii"&gt;Live at Pompeii&lt;/a&gt;" in the background.&amp;nbsp; I've already covered the similar but far more rare "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/02/pink-floyd-hour-with-pink-floyd-kqed-lp.html"&gt;An Hour With Pink Floyd (KQED)&lt;/a&gt;" from 1970.&amp;nbsp; The latter was never commercially released and is regularly purged from Youtube, while the former concert film is still commercially available and also easy to find on Youtube.&amp;nbsp; Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an historically important film, showing the group on the cusp of their 1973 watershed, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon"&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; But I just recently discovered that the interstitial studio footage of the band composing songs for DSOTM was 1) faked, and 2) added for the 1974 re-release of the film.&amp;nbsp; It is this 1974 version that I have on VHS.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat unfortunately, the 2003 DVD version is the "director's cut", and nicely demonstrates that more is not always better.&amp;nbsp; The songs are the same, but director Adrian Maben has added all kinds of unnecessary of additional space and planetary stock footage.&amp;nbsp; I get it, "Pink Floyd == Space Music".&amp;nbsp; But one of the strengths of the original film is Pompeii as a character, almost a fifth member of Pink Floyd.&amp;nbsp; The long tracking shots of the empty &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphitheatre_of_Pompeii"&gt;Amphitheatre&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.pompeionline.net/pompeii/mosaic.htm"&gt;mosaics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79"&gt;volcanic imagery&lt;/a&gt;, all help to establish the film's feel, and the director's cut undermines the beautiful (albeit sometimes modishly incorporated) imagery.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately the 1974 version is an option on the DVD; the 2003 version is to be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough complaining about directorial revisionism -- Maben does deserve credit for making a concert film without an audience (has this been done since?) as well as not attempting to hide the small army of staff supporting the AV gear.&amp;nbsp; Replacing the audience with staff and infrastructure and playing to an empty Amphitheatre somehow captures the desolation of Pompeii.&amp;nbsp; The songs are split between 1968 and 1971, with only "Controls" and "Careful" appearing on the "An Hour With Pink Floyd (KQED)".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Intro Song"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echoes_(Pink_Floyd_song)" title="Echoes (Pink Floyd song)"&gt;Echoes, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;" (from &lt;i&gt;Meddle&lt;/i&gt;, 1971)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careful_with_That_Axe,_Eugene" title="Careful with That Axe, Eugene"&gt;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&lt;/a&gt;" (from &lt;i&gt;Point Me At The Sky&lt;/i&gt;, B-side, 1968)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Saucerful_of_Secrets_(song)" title="A Saucerful of Secrets (song)"&gt;A Saucerful of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;" (from &lt;i&gt;A Saucerful of Secrets&lt;/i&gt;, 1968)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Days_(Pink_Floyd_song)" title="One of These Days (Pink Floyd song)"&gt;One of These Days I'm Going to Cut You into Little Pieces&lt;/a&gt;" (from &lt;i&gt;Meddle&lt;/i&gt;, 1971)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_the_Controls_for_the_Heart_of_the_Sun" title="Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"&gt;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;" (from &lt;i&gt;A Saucerful of Secrets&lt;/i&gt;, 1968)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamus_(song)" title="Seamus (song)"&gt;Mademoiselle Nobs&lt;/a&gt;" (from &lt;i&gt;Meddle&lt;/i&gt;, 1971)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Echoes, Part 2" (from &lt;i&gt;Meddle&lt;/i&gt;, 1971)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than linking to individual songs, all versions uploaded to Youtube in their entirety:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live At Pompeii: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2UxVVo8UIg"&gt;1972 Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live At Pompeii: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltopz0TjkxE"&gt;1974 Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live At Popmeii: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOi2nVB31GM"&gt;2003 Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the DVD, an interview with Adrian Maben: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaSS325g8ts"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL10JGiT5tQ"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLekJCzlhKQ"&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, you can't mention "Live at Pompeii" and not mention the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys"&gt;Beastie Boys&lt;/a&gt; "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_%28song%29"&gt;Gratitude&lt;/a&gt;", in which &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdJ5e70Q8mw"&gt;the entire video is a love letter to "Live at Pompeii"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

    <title>Negativland - "Live at Lewis's, Norfolk VA, November 21, 1992" (concert)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344730+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P6RaM0o2bc0/Um5zjfoffXI/AAAAAAAABMI/NXsjpYRGbuI/s1600/negativland-guns-signed.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P6RaM0o2bc0/Um5zjfoffXI/AAAAAAAABMI/NXsjpYRGbuI/s200/negativland-guns-signed.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Terry finally uploaded to Youtube one of my favorite videos of his from back in the day.&amp;nbsp; Almost exactly 21 years ago &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativland"&gt;Negativland&lt;/a&gt; played at Lewis's in Norfolk, right outside of the Colonial Place neighborhood where I live.&amp;nbsp; Lewis's was a nondescript seafood restaurant that often featured bands in the evening.&amp;nbsp; Eventually it became &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/enricos-ristorante-norfolk"&gt;Enrico's&lt;/a&gt;, a pretty good Greek restaurant, which eventually closed in a dispute with the landlord and in it's place came &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenix-bar-and-grill-norfolk"&gt;Phoenix Bar and Grill&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted less than a year (we never even tried it).&amp;nbsp; The building (&lt;a href="http://goo.gl/maps/p635W"&gt;4012 Colley Ave.&lt;/a&gt;) is currently inactive.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Of course, at the time neither Terry nor I were living in Norfolk, and I think Danette had just moved here.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is that both Negativland and Lewis's are amenable to someone like Terry recording the entire event.&amp;nbsp; We were both big fans of Negativland, and this was right in the middle of their struggle with U2, Island, and SST (see my reviews of "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/08/negativland-guns-lp-review.html"&gt;Guns&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/01/negativland-u2-lp-review.html"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt;" for background info).&amp;nbsp; I must have watched this video 20 or more times; but since he recorded it on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-VHS"&gt;S-VHS&lt;/a&gt;, I never got a VHS copy.&amp;nbsp; And although I've watched it enough that it seems like I was there, I'm slightly ashamed to admit that I &lt;i&gt;missed&lt;/i&gt; this concert and attended a VT-UVa football game instead (although Terry has it marked as "October 21", I'm pretty sure this was actually November 21, 1992).&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, Terry took my copy of "Guns" and got &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hosler"&gt;Mark Hosler&lt;/a&gt; to autograph the inside fold (see above pic).&amp;nbsp; Apparently Mark did not approve of my choice of weekend entertainment either (also, it rained and VT lost -- a bad choice all around).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wasn't there, and most likely you weren't there either (it's not a big place), but thanks to Terry it can &lt;i&gt;seem&lt;/i&gt; like we were there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JQcNVMsxB_0" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't normally embed videos, but this one deserves it.&amp;nbsp; You really should watch the whole thing, but some highlights include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26:20 -- "Time Zones" &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;31:05 -- "Black Lady of Espionage", segueing into "Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1:04:10 -- "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_Is_Stupid"&gt;Christianity is Stupid&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1:11:20 -- Lee Greenwood's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Bless_the_USA"&gt;God Bless the USA&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1:24:40 -- Terry interviews Mark Hosler (while Mark has a post-show fish sandwich)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Baldwin"&gt;Craig Baldwin&lt;/a&gt; used part of this concert footage in his film "&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/dom-25571-sonicoutlaws"&gt;Sonic Outlaws&lt;/a&gt;", earning Terry a credit in the liner notes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, instead of reviewing it as a LP, I'm starting a new series simply called "concert".&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>The Green Pajamas - "Kim The Waitress" (forgotten song)</title>

I feel this way about you."&amp;nbsp; So while not a typical love song, that's how I've come to link this song to Danette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Material Issue made one slight change in the lyrics that made the song darker than was written by The Green Pajamas.&amp;nbsp; The chorus was originally:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;No one can save us&lt;br /&gt;But Kim The Waitress&lt;/blockquote&gt;Material Issue changed it to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;No one can save us&lt;br /&gt;From Kim The Waitress&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thereby transforming Kim from the unintentional hero to the unintentional villain.&amp;nbsp; Turns out there was a &lt;a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858550786/?&amp;amp;specific_com=73015569400#comments"&gt;real waitress named Kim&lt;/a&gt;, and when she learned of this song much later in life she apparently took it in good humor.&amp;nbsp; However, unlike the song writer I ended up together with the object of my fascination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Green Pajamas: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGAQJI-BBs0"&gt;Kim The Waitress&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-Ana22flDE"&gt;2009 live version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Material Issue: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS5oa5IPSX0"&gt;Kim The Waitress&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sister Psychic: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C3iQlh9MkM"&gt;Kim The Waitress&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailer for a &lt;a href="http://thegreenpajamas.net/news/post/kim-the-waitress-film"&gt;short film based on the song&lt;/a&gt;, by Scott Eriksson.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1EwlT_rRE8"&gt;full film&lt;/a&gt; is also available, but it explores the darker avenue of this song (e.g., "and it bothers me"). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior Danette Birthday postings, the beginnings of a loving but irreverent mix tape:&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2012: The Cure - "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-cure-high-forgotten-song.html"&gt;High&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;2011: Blink 182 - "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/09/blink-182-josie-forgotten-song.html"&gt;Josie&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;2010:&amp;nbsp; Dead Milkmen - "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/09/dead-milkmen-punk-rock-girl-forgotten.html"&gt;Punk Rock Girl&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>The Naked and Famous - "Passive Me, Aggressive You" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344773+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HBXQvX4BL6o/UhpGKAcmeDI/AAAAAAAABJM/Wd_KclhM8uc/s1600/tnaf-pm-ay.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HBXQvX4BL6o/UhpGKAcmeDI/AAAAAAAABJM/Wd_KclhM8uc/s200/tnaf-pm-ay.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Quick -- how many bands do you know that hail from New Zealand?&amp;nbsp; I count three; I'll treat &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_Enz"&gt;Split Enz&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowded_House"&gt;Crowded House&lt;/a&gt; as one band, but I'll also include the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Conchords"&gt;Flight of Conchords&lt;/a&gt; as a band (which I admit is debatable).&amp;nbsp; The third, and surely deserving of your attention, is Auckland's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_and_Famous"&gt;The Naked and Famous&lt;/a&gt; (TNAF).&amp;nbsp; The local alt-rock station (96.1) started playing "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Blood_(The_Naked_and_Famous_song)"&gt;Young Blood&lt;/a&gt;" in high rotation over a year ago and after poking around on Youtube, I decided to buy their 2010 debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_Me,_Aggressive_You"&gt;Passive Me, Aggressive You&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My iTunes play counts don't lie: I really like this LP.&amp;nbsp; I recall on the first listen, on every track I recounted the various moody, 70s &amp;amp; 80s synth pop influences (e.g., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_Music"&gt;Roxy Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Joy%20Division"&gt;Joy Division&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/New%20Order"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depeche_Mode"&gt;Depeche Mode&lt;/a&gt;) but there were so many that I eventually decided if you incorporate dozens of different influences and update them by 20+ years then you've really created something new.&amp;nbsp; Another thing they offer is they rock &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; harder than any of their influences -- they must have every distortion pedal that exists in New Zealand.&amp;nbsp; The other distinguishing characteristic of the band is that Aaron Philip Short &amp;amp; Alisa Xayalith work the shared, male/female lead vocals to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently I bought their first two EPs and while not bad, they don't give any hint of how well this LP would come together.&amp;nbsp; Their next LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Rolling_Waves"&gt;In Rolling Waves&lt;/a&gt;", is due in less than a month and the advance single ("&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqUJdcCjUIA"&gt;Hearts Like Ours&lt;/a&gt;") is already out.&amp;nbsp; We'll see if they can catch lightning in a bottle twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MR3wfzLOio"&gt;All Of This&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRDR43fDKNA"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCcUXEC5_eU"&gt;Punching In A Dream&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdO85Qf4Poc"&gt;Young Blood&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olr5Bk7jm3I"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHC8vuBU9rg"&gt;Girls Like You&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9PfpmywTE"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CPq7VXgTlA"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;"* (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2qph_66beY"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewEs-p1wqco"&gt;Jilted Lovers&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfbdnIFQbGQ"&gt;No Way&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: "Eyes" (they carry the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_%28filmmaker%29"&gt;John Hughes&lt;/a&gt; soundtrack influence too far here...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: lots of good stuff on their &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tnafofficial"&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*="The Sun" makes it clear that their LP collection contains "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_A"&gt;Kid A&lt;/a&gt;" too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Rachel Goswell - "Waves Are Universal" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344787+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UwaqQPBa2wU/UffRNX1-Z2I/AAAAAAAABIk/kKElOqTp3Qw/s1600/rachel-goswell-waves.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UwaqQPBa2wU/UffRNX1-Z2I/AAAAAAAABIk/kKElOqTp3Qw/s200/rachel-goswell-waves.jpeg" width="192" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I love the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegazing"&gt;shoegazing&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowdive"&gt;Slowdive&lt;/a&gt;, and I also love the dream-pop, alt-country of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_3"&gt;Mojave 3&lt;/a&gt; (formed from the remains of Slowdive).&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Goswell"&gt;Rachel Goswell&lt;/a&gt; is one of the two vocalists of both bands, and she achieves angelic perfection on songs like Slowdive's dreamy "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbgWjujwvwo"&gt;Shine&lt;/a&gt;" and Mojave 3's smoky "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhGCk1Nlyfw"&gt;Love Songs on the Radio&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Nothing against &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Halstead"&gt;Neil Halstead&lt;/a&gt;, the other (and primary) vocalist for both bands, but listening to "Shine" makes you think "why doesn't Rachel sing on more songs?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, 2004's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waves_Are_Universal"&gt;Waves Are Universal&lt;/a&gt;" is Goswell's first (and only) solo LP.&amp;nbsp; Just what I wanted: twelve songs with just Rachel -- alright! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, it's kind of boring.&amp;nbsp; I don't know if it is the song writing (Halstead was the primary song writer for Slowdive and Mojave 3), the production, or what.&amp;nbsp; None of the songs are bad, but none really stand out either.&amp;nbsp; I think some of the reviews (e.g., &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3650-waves-are-universal/"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/waves-are-universal-mw0000655945"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt;) give her a pass out of respect for her prior work, but if you read between the lines they see many of the same faults that I see.&amp;nbsp; Her vocals are guarded, and she's backed up by what sounds like a second-rate &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Horse_%28band%29"&gt;Crazy Horse&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand out songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Songs that appear: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WRypbL8_Ew"&gt;Coastline&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLCblhX5n0Q"&gt;Save Yourself&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylsIasAT9CI"&gt;Warm Summer Sun&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t930Ub0sxIg"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xngTgTqRC8"&gt;No Substitute&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 5/10.&amp;nbsp; Again, not bad, but far below what I hoped a Rachel Goswell solo LP would be.</content>

    <title>The Brains - "Money Changes Everything" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344801+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uEpclkiztnA/Udg766cRcwI/AAAAAAAABGM/1ykWL4t8Qdc/s1600/brains-money-changes-everything.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="193" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uEpclkiztnA/Udg766cRcwI/AAAAAAAABGM/1ykWL4t8Qdc/s200/brains-money-changes-everything.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Last night &lt;a href="http://feministforum.tumblr.com/post/54722142954/shes-so-unusual-as-michael-and-i-were-leaving-to"&gt;Danette and I went to see Cyndi Lauper&lt;/a&gt; at the excellent Portsmouth Pavilion.&amp;nbsp; Neither of us were huge fans of hers but being children of the 80s, when our neighbor Steve offered us free tickets we couldn't say no.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyndi_Lauper"&gt;Cyndi Lauper&lt;/a&gt; put on a good show and with "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinky_Boots_%28musical%29"&gt;Kinky Boots&lt;/a&gt;" she's enjoying a second wind.&amp;nbsp; But last night's show was about revisiting track-by-track "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27s_So_Unusual"&gt;She's So Unusual&lt;/a&gt;", her 1983 breakthrough LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LP (and thus the concert) opened with "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Changes_Everything"&gt;Money Changes Everything&lt;/a&gt;", which if I had a favorite Cyndi Lauper song, it would probably be this.&amp;nbsp; But last night I discovered this was actually a cover, and the song was originally done by a little-known Atlanta-based new wave group called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brains"&gt;The Brains&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; "Money Changes Everything" was their &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Qwer-Money-Qwer/release/1869497"&gt;initial 7" single&lt;/a&gt; released in 1978, and then appearing again on their 1980 debut &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brains_%28The_Brains_album%29"&gt;eponymous LP&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Releasing two LPs and an EP, The Brains never enjoyed much success as a band, and aside from Cyndi Lauper covering their song, their next biggest footnote was upon breaking up one of their members joined &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Georgia_Satellites"&gt;The Georgia Satellites&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;While I love the late 70s garage sound on original version, Cyndi's version might actually be better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm certain that I'll have immediate recall of the fact that "The Brains are the original artist for `Money Changes Everything'".&amp;nbsp; This piece of trivia has surely overwritten something important in my memory, like my work phone number, the names of long-term colleagues, places I've lived, etc.&amp;nbsp; But surely I'll hold on to this fact like my life depended on it...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does that opening keyboard riff sound familiar?&amp;nbsp; It reminds me of the guitar riff in "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_%28song%29"&gt;Pretty in Pink&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Psychedelic_Furs"&gt;The Psychedelic Furs&lt;/a&gt;; the original 1981 version, not the more polished &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_%28soundtrack%29#Soundtrack"&gt;1986 soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; version.&amp;nbsp; Our friend Joy asked for more &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Pretty%20in%20Pink"&gt;"Pretty in Pink" references&lt;/a&gt;, so there you go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The Brains: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLWbp3w2eqM"&gt;Money Changes Everything&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyndi Lauper: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aK-UjR3Oj4"&gt;Money Changes Everything&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychedelic Furs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c08vQ-vUhWI"&gt;Pretty in Pink&lt;/a&gt;" (1981), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqmTMiIMG74"&gt;Pretty in Pink&lt;/a&gt;" (1986)</content>

    <title>Houndmouth - "Houndmouth" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344829+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sp4TVOmz78k/Uceu9vSIGrI/AAAAAAAABFo/ZbrxAvg9jww/s1600/houndmouth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sp4TVOmz78k/Uceu9vSIGrI/AAAAAAAABFo/ZbrxAvg9jww/s200/houndmouth.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;To borrow from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Talk"&gt;Tappet Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, the last several reviews have been "classic", and by "classic" I mean "old".&amp;nbsp; Time for something contemporary...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Houndmouth-Houndmouth/master/505764"&gt;Houndmouth&lt;/a&gt;" is the eponymous 2012 debut by the Indiana-based band, &lt;a href="http://houndmouth.com/"&gt;Houndmouth&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This four song EP successfully mines the alt-country, folk, blues, roots music genres: there's not necessary anything &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; on this EP, but they execute it very well.&amp;nbsp; Lisa (via Herbert) actually turned me on to this band, kindly dropping the CD in the mail to me a few months ago.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're going to do country music, you need a song about going to jail.&amp;nbsp; Just in case there was any doubt, the opening song is "&lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107859450773/"&gt;Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt;": &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Come on down&lt;br /&gt;To the Penitentiary &lt;br /&gt;Oh momma the law came crashing down on me&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Excellent stuff.&amp;nbsp; The other standout track is "Krampus", nicely featuring the vocals from Katie Toupin and Matt Myers.&amp;nbsp; "Houston Train" is also good, with "Oil Spill" being the weakest of the four songs.&amp;nbsp; I must not be the only one that feels that way since "Oil Spill" is the only track off "Houndmouth" that was left off their 2013 full-length LP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Houndmouth-From-The-Hills-Below-The-City/master/568254"&gt;From The Hills Below The City&lt;/a&gt;" (which I haven't had a chance to get yet).&amp;nbsp; A quick search shows that they're booked on a lot of major summer festivals (&lt;a href="http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/houndmouth"&gt;Lollapalooza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.newportfolkfest.net/lineup/saturday/houndmouth"&gt;Newport Folk Festival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.utopiafest.com/lineup/previouslineups/houndmouth/"&gt;UTOPiAfest&lt;/a&gt;); these guys are poised for success in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "Penitentiary" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hws_N4St0BU"&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAg1gLP9o84"&gt;live November 2012&lt;/a&gt;), "Houston Train" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVuNUtbg_Bo"&gt;live UTOPiAfest 2012&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3r9Cp2ALX8"&gt;live November 2012&lt;/a&gt;), "Krampus" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l3oPZr2JpM"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn8hIBVKTjQ"&gt;live acoustic&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 8/10&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Husker Du - "Candy Apple Grey" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344843+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qUW3yh8EMhg/UcXGYR2RumI/AAAAAAAABFc/M_in_0Q-t1k/s1600/husker-du-candy-apple-grey.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="198" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qUW3yh8EMhg/UcXGYR2RumI/AAAAAAAABFc/M_in_0Q-t1k/s200/husker-du-candy-apple-grey.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Apple_Grey"&gt;Candy Apple Grey&lt;/a&gt;" is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt;'s 1986 major label debut after four critically acclaimed LPs (and one EP) on &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Reflex+Records+%285%29"&gt;Reflex Records&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SST_Records"&gt;SST Records&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This means there are two general reactions to the LP: many long-time fans accused them of selling out, and major magazines (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/candy-apple-grey-19860522"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;) fawned over the LP in an effort to make up for ignoring their 1982-1985 output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, most reviewers feel the truth is somewhere in between (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.punknews.org/review/7630/"&gt;Punknews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://culturefusionreviews.com/2012/04/13/husker-du-series-part-8-candy-apple-grey/"&gt;Culture Fusion&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; This is a good LP that should be in your collection, but it lacks the intensity and consistency of LPs like "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/04/husker-du-new-day-rising-lp-review.html"&gt;New Day Rising&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/husker-du-flip-your-wig-lp-review.html"&gt;Flip Your Wig&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; It is tempting to put the blame on the big, bad major label but apparently the real villain is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC#Signing_with_Warner_Bros._and_breakup"&gt;increasing rivalry&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Hart"&gt;Grant Hart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Mould"&gt;Bob Mould&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the Warner Brothers deal kept the band together longer than they would have if they had remained on SST.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts of "Candy Apple Grey" would be at home on any of their previous releases: "Don't Want to Know If You're Lonely", "Sorry Somehow", "Crystal".&amp;nbsp; Some represent a more poppy, college radio sound that hints at their later solo releases, like "Too Far Down", "Hardly Getting Over It", "No Promise Have I Made".&amp;nbsp; Those songs are fine, but the weakest moment on the LP are songs like "Dead Set On Destruction" and "Eiffel Tower High".&amp;nbsp; Those two songs, while not terrible, have a kind of awkward self-awareness; I can imagine Bob and Grant saying to themselves "hey, in the next 30 minutes I need to write a song that rocks harder than {Bob's|Grant's}!".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoKeH7JYE48"&gt;Don't Want to Know If You're Lonely&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjZWJoNYpHI"&gt;Sorry Somehow&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoxflJFTgl4"&gt;Too Far Down&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5iTdSwJKcs"&gt;Hardly Getting Over It&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yuHslTFqQg"&gt;Dead Set On Destruction&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZeBJ190j7A"&gt;Eiffel Tower High&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 7/10.&amp;nbsp; WB Husker Du pales in comparison to SST Husker Du, but it is still better than most bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqz11xVZJCs"&gt;MTV review&lt;/a&gt; of "Candy Apple Grey" (featuring &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Quinn"&gt;Martha Quinn&lt;/a&gt;), complete with May 1986 tour dates in case you invent a time machine and want to catch them live.&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>Stanley Jordan - "Stairway to Heaven" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344857+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-auXigt5kTOY/UbeQST3IlJI/AAAAAAAABDU/hVd0Zv1gET0/s1600/cavalier-hotel.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="160" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-auXigt5kTOY/UbeQST3IlJI/AAAAAAAABDU/hVd0Zv1gET0/s200/cavalier-hotel.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The sale of Virginia Beach's iconic &lt;a href="http://www.cavalierhotel.com/history/"&gt;Cavalier Hotel&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2013/06/judge-oks-cavalier-hotel-sale-va-beach-developer"&gt; announced in today's Virginian Pilot&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Despite &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2013/06/thompson-proposes-200m-cavalier-hotel-project"&gt;grand plans&lt;/a&gt; for the hotel, I'm betting on the worst-case scenario of razing, as a result of long-term mismanagement and neglect, culminating in a recent &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2013/01/virginia-beachs-cavalier-hotel-sale"&gt;law suit with the family members suing each other&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic"&gt;Southern Gothic&lt;/a&gt; family + a developer + the city of Virginia Beach = hard to imagine a positive outcome.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I've been to The Cavalier twice, and the first time was to see jazz guitarist extraordinaire &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Jordan"&gt;Stanley Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, ca. 1991 (I'm actually a little fuzzy on the date).&amp;nbsp; I've seen &amp;amp; heard a lot of guitar virtuosos, but watching &amp;amp; listening to Stanley Jordan is simply amazing.&amp;nbsp; I don't own any of his LPs, but that has been by accident more than design.&amp;nbsp; His concert at The Cavalier Hotel was excellent, but of course the highlight for me was his version of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven"&gt;Stairway to Heaven&lt;/a&gt;" (yes, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; "Stairway to Heaven"), off his 1988 LP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stanley-Jordan-Flying-Home/release/1735441"&gt;Flying Home&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; One of my favorite memories of all time was watching several 70+ year-old, black, grandfather-types (the audience was mostly older &amp;amp; black; at 21 &amp;amp; white I was a distinct minority) stand in the aisle -- at a jazz concert, may I remind you -- and (sincerely) yell "play 'Stairway to Heaven'!!!".&amp;nbsp; Yes, my life is fuller because of those memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanley Jordan - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeooHiX4oH0"&gt;Stairway to Heaven&lt;/a&gt;" (live, late 80s/early 90s judging by the outfit).*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they save The Cavalier, but I'm not counting on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* = No, I'm not linking to the original.&amp;nbsp;</content>

W. Bush decided idealism is bad for business and &lt;a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900524&amp;amp;slug=1073538"&gt;extended China's "Most Favored Nation" trade status&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; And less than a week ago, and very close to home, Shuanghui International Holdings proposed to &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2013/06/some-shoppers-reject-chineseowned-smithfield-pork"&gt;buy local giant Smithfield Foods&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps economic ties will eventually prove more subversive to China's regime than supporting the protesters in 1989, but I will never forget my bitter disappointment that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism"&gt;when called upon&lt;/a&gt;, we turned a deaf ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(band)"&gt;Discharge&lt;/a&gt;'s punk classic 1982 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hear_Nothing_See_Nothing_Say_Nothing"&gt;Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing&lt;/a&gt;", "Protest and Survive":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;It's up to us, to change the course&lt;br /&gt;Protest and survive, protest and survive&lt;br /&gt;Protest and survive,&lt;br /&gt;Protest and survive&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax_(band)"&gt;Anthrax&lt;/a&gt; would later cover this song on their 1991 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Killer_B%27s"&gt;Attack of the Killer B's&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discharge - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i70zFUh5ugA"&gt;Protest and Survive&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Anthrax - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-r7ewuX9vw"&gt;Protest and Survive (live 1996)&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Galaxie 500 - "Peel Sessions" (LP Review)</title>

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real highlight here are the three "new" songs.&amp;nbsp; Galaxie 500 always had a tradition of showing how smart they were with their meticulous selection of covers.&amp;nbsp; Of course their standard &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Richman"&gt;Jonathan Richmond&lt;/a&gt; cover "Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste" is present (I think few would argue that Galaxie 500 now owns this song, not Richmond), but they also turn in inspired interpretations of "Submission" (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols"&gt;Sex Pistols&lt;/a&gt;), "Final Day" (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Marble_Giants"&gt;Young Marble Giants&lt;/a&gt;), and "Moonshot" (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_Sainte-Marie"&gt;Buffy Sainte-Marie&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Sure you've heard of the Pistols, but "Submission" is an inspired choice; YMG was influential but not famous, and ask your hippie parents about BSM (the Pistols *and* Buffy Sainte-Marie?!&amp;nbsp; genius.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to break with the standard LP review format and just list all eight tracks and claim them all as "standouts" (and obviously there are no tracks to skip).&amp;nbsp; The first four are from the October 1990 session and the last four are from the September 1989 session:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLw3LFSMwoA"&gt;Submission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpT4-dYuhgg"&gt;Final Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppRRDKJ9rtU"&gt;When Will You Come Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWOWffJyacg"&gt;Moonshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjEOJqN3wVY"&gt;Flowers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0xFfMx66H4"&gt;Blue Thunder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z9x04AKaqM"&gt;Decomposing Trees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9oWXeUij1w"&gt;Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Bonus links to the original versions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sex Pistols: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UZ0bPaOdbQ"&gt;Submission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Young Marble Giants: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fygy9RDhREg"&gt;Final Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buffy Sainte-Marie: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9vAa2mNoqQ"&gt;Moonshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Richmond &amp;amp; the Modern Lovers: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US0uQfm7g9I"&gt;Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Final score: 9/10.&amp;nbsp; While there are only three "new" songs, this is an LP I can easily recommend to those not already familiar with Galaxie 500.&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>My Bloody Valentine - "Loveless" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344898+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6pevoDQTniw/UZP0FHUpD7I/AAAAAAAAA80/vjcq1DnKlIU/s1600/MyBloodyValentineLoveless.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="196" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6pevoDQTniw/UZP0FHUpD7I/AAAAAAAAA80/vjcq1DnKlIU/s200/MyBloodyValentineLoveless.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I had been resisting reviewing "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveless_(album)"&gt;Loveless&lt;/a&gt;" because it is just too obvious: there are innumerable reviews proclaiming the excellence of this LP (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/loveless-mw0000272104"&gt;Allmusic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/11/my-bloody-valentine-loveless/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16981/reviews/4144878"&gt;Drowned In Sound&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp; But with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_(band)"&gt;My Bloody Valentine&lt;/a&gt;'s out-of-print EPs collected on "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EP%27s_1988%E2%80%931991"&gt;EPs 1988-1991&lt;/a&gt;" and *finally* a new LP,&amp;nbsp; "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBV_%28album%29"&gt;m b v&lt;/a&gt;", I've decided to include it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first heard this LP in 1999, ordering it at the same time as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow"&gt;DJ Shadow&lt;/a&gt;'s seminal "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endtroducing....."&gt;Endtroducing.....&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; They don't sound anything alike, but they are similar in that once you listen to them, you'll never hear music the same way again.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than throw hundreds of words at this LP, the eccentricities and innovations of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Shields"&gt;Kevin Shields&lt;/a&gt;, or how the cover art matches the sound, instead I'll offer my initial, visceral reaction from 1999:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dying Swan Music*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, that's the best I can do, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.litscape.com/author/Alfred_Lord_Tennyson/The_Dying_Swan.html"&gt;Tennyson&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;But anon her awful jubilant voice,&lt;br /&gt;With a music strange and manifold,&lt;br /&gt;Flow'd forth on a carol free and bold;&lt;br /&gt;As when a mighty people rejoice&lt;/blockquote&gt;Standout songs:&amp;nbsp; All, and it really should be consumed as a whole, start to finish (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL31CBEB4608C17125"&gt;Youtube playlist&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; If forced to pick three, I'd go with: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chaYm2TqfHM"&gt;To Here Knows When&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iT5EuTlHOM"&gt;Sometimes&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVuARAzNnKw"&gt;Blown A Wish&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: In addition to "10/10", this LP earns my very rare "beyond music" label; "music" is just too limiting a concept to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links: official videos for "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdHS1sbV5xw"&gt;To Here Knows When&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvkK0mO7fXg"&gt;Soon&lt;/a&gt;" (radio edit).&amp;nbsp;  I'm pretty sure most of the "official" videos for MBV are the same  footage used over and over again, but how else would you do it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* = Listen to "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtrROOxqnFE"&gt;Touched&lt;/a&gt;", a sort of intro to "To Here Knows When", and then get back to me when you come up with a better description.</content>

    <title>Sonic Youth - "Diamond Sea" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344912+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87p5dxzSLEo/UZKOqoKOQrI/AAAAAAAAA8k/NmrBRrSKsFw/s1600/SonicYouthTheDiamondSea.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="181" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-87p5dxzSLEo/UZKOqoKOQrI/AAAAAAAAA8k/NmrBRrSKsFw/s200/SonicYouthTheDiamondSea.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;"Time takes its crazy toll&lt;br /&gt;And how does your mirror grow&lt;br /&gt;You better watch yourself when you jump into it&lt;br /&gt;Cause the mirror's gonna steal your soul"&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm not sure how I've managed to blog this long and not really mention &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life"&gt;Our Band Could Be Your Life&lt;/a&gt;", and this has caused me to go back and rip all the various SY cds that I somehow had failed to in the past.&amp;nbsp; I have a significant portion of their considerable &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth_discography"&gt;discography&lt;/a&gt;, and while I'd love to tell you that my favorite song is "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Age_Riot"&gt;Teen Age Riot&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Yr_Idols"&gt;Kill Yr. Idols&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_%2769"&gt;Death Valley '69&lt;/a&gt;", or something like that, the truth is my favorite SY song is actually "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Sea"&gt;Diamond Sea&lt;/a&gt;", the first single from their 1995 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_Machine_%28album%29"&gt;Washing Machine&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprisingly disappointed when in late 2011 it was announced that after 27 years of marriage SY founders &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_Moore"&gt;Thurston Moore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Gordon"&gt;Kim Gordon&lt;/a&gt; were splitting up, effectively ending the 30 year career of Sonic Youth in the process.&amp;nbsp; Individually, Thurston &amp;amp; Kim are the epitome of cool and their long-standing rock-n-roll marriage was even cooler.&amp;nbsp; Less than a month ago, &lt;a href="http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/celebrities/kim-gordon-sonic-youth-profile"&gt;Kim revealed in an interview&lt;/a&gt; that the marriage ended because of Thurston's mid-life crisis.&amp;nbsp; Shortly thereafter the &lt;a href="http://jezebel.com/is-this-the-woman-who-broke-up-kim-gordon-and-thurston-478479027"&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt; of the "other woman" was revealed, and then the inevitable back-lash for "&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/24/kim-gordon-and-thurston-moore-divorce_n_3148044.html"&gt;shaming&lt;/a&gt;" the woman while more or less giving Thurston a pass.&amp;nbsp; I guess marriages break up every day, but most don't claim the careers of seminal bands like Sonic Youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;"Time takes its crazy toll&lt;br /&gt;Mirror fallin' off the wall&lt;br /&gt;You better look out for the looking glass girl&lt;br /&gt;Cause she's gonna take you for a fall"&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Diamond Sea": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpfZ60wqyUo"&gt;5:45 radio edit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6bqziyXO6Y"&gt;19:36 LP version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BZXco773kk"&gt;20 min live version&lt;/a&gt; (1996)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I'm ashamed to admit it, I frequently prefer the radio edit to the freak-out LP version.</content>

    <title>Slayer - "Haunting The Chapel" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344926+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-quEWvVDi08w/UYUb3RZI4RI/AAAAAAAAA64/Xuc2nJXh5v0/s1600/slayer-haunting.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="197" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-quEWvVDi08w/UYUb3RZI4RI/AAAAAAAAA64/Xuc2nJXh5v0/s200/slayer-haunting.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I had been meaning to review this one for a while, but once again a recent death has influenced the order of reviews:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hanneman"&gt;Jeff Hanneman&lt;/a&gt;, a founding member of the seminal &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal"&gt;thrash metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt;, died on May 2. &amp;nbsp; While their contemporaries &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt; achieved more commercial success, Slayer arguably has the stronger, more consistent &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer_discography"&gt;discography&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Slayer's 1983 debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_No_Mercy_%28Slayer_album%29"&gt;Show No Mercy&lt;/a&gt;" was a strong, heavy LP, it was their 1984 three song EP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunting_the_Chapel"&gt;Haunting the Chapel&lt;/a&gt;" that really defined the genre.&amp;nbsp; Especially influential was the double bass work of drummer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lombardo"&gt;Dave Lombardo&lt;/a&gt;, after this EP came out if you didn't have that double bass sound, you weren't a serious thrash band.&amp;nbsp; Of the three songs, the one you really must listen to is "Chemical  Warfare".&amp;nbsp; Nearly 30 years after it was released this is still one of  the heaviest songs I've ever heard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff Hanneman shared lead guitar duties with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_King"&gt;Kerry King&lt;/a&gt; as well as writing or co-writing most of their songs.&amp;nbsp; Although he had been sidelined for a few years due to a &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/slayer-guitarist-jeff-hanneman-dies-49-010947594.html"&gt;spider bite&lt;/a&gt;, everyone believed the worst was behind him and he was writing new material for their next LP.&amp;nbsp; Slayer had always been one of the more stable bands (with only Dave Lombardo leaving and rejoining a few times), so it will be interesting to see if they carry on without Jeff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5L7GyZeazM"&gt;Chemical Warfare&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCXjinjJv9w"&gt;Haunting The Chapel&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeAV3LTNGks"&gt;Captor of Sin&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip'em songs: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10.&amp;nbsp; This EP points the way to "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Awaits"&gt;Hell Awaits&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_in_Blood"&gt;Reign in Blood&lt;/a&gt;", as well as reminding me of my tape trading days w/ Scott Kinkade et al.&amp;nbsp; Honorable mention to the late &lt;a href="http://demolition.wordpress.com/2007/11/06/bob-kickass-muldowney-rip/"&gt;Bob Muldowney&lt;/a&gt;, publisher of Kick*Ass Monthly, for describing the importance of this EP back in the day.</content>

    <title>Unkle - "Do Androids Dream of Electric Beats?" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344955+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mf0naEdsYRE/UWrQdKeR_JI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/6o1YnnISREU/s1600/do-androids.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mf0naEdsYRE/UWrQdKeR_JI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/6o1YnnISREU/s200/do-androids.jpg" width="197" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Although this is "only" a bootleg, it is one of the prized members of my CD collection.&amp;nbsp; Unkle's* 2001 triple LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Beats%3F"&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Beats?&lt;/a&gt;" might be the best DJ mix I've heard.&amp;nbsp; Unkle has always been James Lavelle and whomever he is working with at the time (at this point, it was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_File"&gt;Richard File&lt;/a&gt; -- but make no mistake, this is James Lavelle's vision).&amp;nbsp; Originally intended for a Japanese radio show, this is not your ordinary club/ dance mix and is more suited for a theater than a club.&amp;nbsp; With the title being a clever nod to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick"&gt;Philip K. Dick&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F"&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&lt;/a&gt;" and the cover art from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_2000"&gt;Futura 2000&lt;/a&gt;, the sci-fi theme is clearly established.&amp;nbsp; In my review of "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/01/dj-shadow-less-you-know-better-lp-review.html"&gt;The Less You Know, The Better&lt;/a&gt;", I described Lavelle's vision as "the soundtrack to the weird sci-fi movie that only &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lavelle"&gt;James Lavelle&lt;/a&gt; can see."&amp;nbsp; If you listen to this mix from start to finish, you'll start to catch glimpses of the movie too.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Lavelle is an extraordinary DJ, and the set pulls together various tracks and genres that would fail miserably in less expert hands.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the usual suspects from Lavelle's label &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo%27_Wax"&gt;Mo' Wax&lt;/a&gt;, there are The Beatles, The Stones, Rare Earth, Fleetwood Mac, Iggy Pop and other surprises.&amp;nbsp; I could try to write more about it, but fortunately due to its not-quite-legal status, it is pretty easy to find on the web.&amp;nbsp; Just listen (each disc is just a single track):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disc one -- "Shin" &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RTs3cD3iJ8"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/davidlund/do-androids-dream-of-electric"&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disc two -- "Gi" &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L5nVojwowY"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/kafrine-pimant/unkle-do-androids-dream-of"&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disc three -- "Tai" &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbzfqD996BU"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://salacioussound.com/2010/10/saturday-mixcast-do-androids-dream-of-electric-beats/"&gt;Salacious Sound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three discs in a single &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjBI567C0GbNQkLDF3GAKCXv_eNvZh_Qb"&gt;Youtube playlist&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You'll have to look at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Beats%3F"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/UNKLE-Sounds-Do-Androids-Dream-Of-Electric-Beats/release/1253647"&gt;Discogs&lt;/a&gt; sites to piece together the source material for each track.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't even think about finding an original version -- there were only 500 copies made, and even the bootleg versions command a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00009Z5AP/ref=sr_1_1_olp?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1365957371&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=do+androids+dream+of+electric+beats&amp;amp;condition=used"&gt;pretty stiff price&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: n/a.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 9/10&amp;nbsp; You read a lot about DJ sets being a "journey", well this is a textbook example.&amp;nbsp; And if "Do Androids Dream of Electric Beats?" is a textbook, then &lt;a href="http://www.karatebyjesse.com/shin-gi-tai-the-definition-of-a-true-sensei/"&gt;James Lavelle is your teacher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I've chosen to credit this to "Unkle", although this was released as Unklesounds, or UNKLESounds, or UNKLE Sounds, depending on what you read.&amp;nbsp; Add to the confusion is the fact that James Lavelle &amp;amp; guest have also released UNKLE, U.N.K.L.E., and other variations.&amp;nbsp; I'm lumping them all under "Unkle".</content>

    <title>Pink Floyd - "Cymbaline" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344969+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLMtLqMnZiA/UWmMiRcX5cI/AAAAAAAAA6A/3sZP13TADlg/s1600/pink-floyd-cymbaline.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="151" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLMtLqMnZiA/UWmMiRcX5cI/AAAAAAAAA6A/3sZP13TADlg/s200/pink-floyd-cymbaline.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm always surprised at the rare concert footage you can find on Youtube.&amp;nbsp; Not long ago I found this June 15th, 1971 recording of Pink Floyd performing "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymbaline"&gt;Cymbaline&lt;/a&gt;" in a church (Abbaye de Royaumont, France) for French TV.&amp;nbsp; Supposedly it is available on the bootleg DVD "&lt;a href="http://www.collectorsmusicreviews.com/pink-floyd/pink-floyd-pro-shot-in-europe-1969-1972/"&gt;Pro-Shot In Europe 1969-1972&lt;/a&gt;", but I have not been able to find a copy.&amp;nbsp; The sound quality is great, but the cinematography is... "interesting".&amp;nbsp; I think the idea was to capture the feel of the church itself, but instead it seems like the cameraman can't find the band for the first minute or so.&amp;nbsp; Once the camerman discovers where the band has setup their gear, it settles into a good video (typical for the era, a single cameraman wanders amongst the band as they play).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've already covered the song in the context of the 1970 concert "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/02/pink-floyd-hour-with-pink-floyd-kqed-lp.html"&gt;An Hour With Pink Floyd (KQED)&lt;/a&gt;" (also only available as a bootleg DVD). &amp;nbsp; The KQED version is similar, but slightly longer and maybe a little bit heavier. Also, it features an odd 30 second pause in the action starting at ~6:00.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The studio version originally appeared on the 1969 "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack_from_the_Film_More"&gt;Soundtrack from the Film More&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; A really good LP in its own right, I have this on tape (recorded during college sometime), but I really need to get this on CD.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The June 1971 recording might be one of the last live performances of "Cymbaline"; by the time of the October 1971 recording of "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/11/pink-floyd-live-at-pompeii-concert.html"&gt;Live at Pompeii&lt;/a&gt;", "Cymbaline" had been replaced by new material from "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meddle"&gt;Meddle&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be my favorite Pink Floyd song, and it is surely one that I can listen to over and over again.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The path you tread is narrow&lt;br /&gt;And the drop is shear and very high&lt;br /&gt;The ravens all are watching&lt;br /&gt;From a vantage point nearby&lt;br /&gt;Apprehension creeping&lt;br /&gt;Like a tube-train up your spine&lt;br /&gt;Will the tightrope reach the end&lt;br /&gt;Will the final couplet rhyme?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Cymbaline - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yGepLq77Oc"&gt;live 1971-06-15&lt;/a&gt; (from "Pro-Shot in Europe 1969-1972")&lt;br /&gt;Cymbaline - &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/38730183"&gt;live 1970-04-29&lt;/a&gt; (on Vimeo since Youtube regularly squelches the KQED videos)&lt;br /&gt;Cymbaline - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MC2GpsgrlY"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt; (with footage from the movie "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_(1969_film)"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering, the &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/2842/"&gt;final couplet doesn't rhyme&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>The Cribs - "Payola" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344982+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UARSmyByo98/UWA9QveG8QI/AAAAAAAAA5w/QaLxVZ-dTNs/s1600/cribs-payola.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UARSmyByo98/UWA9QveG8QI/AAAAAAAAA5w/QaLxVZ-dTNs/s200/cribs-payola.jpg" width="199" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"10 years on and 2001 is long gone &lt;br /&gt;So I didn't wanna write another leather jacket love song"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are the opening lyrics to "Leather Jacket Love Song", the only previously unreleased song on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt; 2013 singles compilation "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-Payola/release/4369611"&gt;Payola&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; It's also a great song and an appropriate way to describe a ten year retrospective.&amp;nbsp; It is also indicative of what's disappointing with "Payola" -- only one unreleased song.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are actually two versions of "Payola": a single CD with 21 singles from their first five LPs and the one unreleased song, and a "deluxe" double CD that also includes 18 b-sides, bonus songs, and non-LP singles. &amp;nbsp; Of course I have all of albums and many of the singles and EPs, so my interest was in the deluxe edition to try to fill out some of the songs that I was missing.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like my review of "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/04/dj-shadow-preemptive-strike-lp-review.html"&gt;Preemptive Strike&lt;/a&gt;", I'm reviewing the collection as a collection, not really the songs themselves.&amp;nbsp; The songs are great, but on a collection like this you have to review how the collection itself was created.&amp;nbsp; My problem with "Payola" is that 1) it oversamples the later LPs, and 2) doesn't have enough hard-to-find material for completists.&amp;nbsp; On disc 1, only seven songs (of 21) come from the first two LPs.&amp;nbsp; But as a collector, I really want to talk about disc 2.&amp;nbsp; The Cribs have always had a strong focus on singles and their associated b-side; for example, see their &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-Collectors-Box-Set-Of-Singles/release/2072609"&gt;7" collector box set&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Not being a 7" collector, I was hoping to get canonical copies of many of their hard-to-find songs.&amp;nbsp; Here's a list of their non-LP songs, roughly in order of the time frames of the corresponding LPs, with "*" indicating presence on "Payola":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-cribs.html"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt;

B-sides from the era of their second LP are well-represented, but unfortunately for me those five songs are also on the 2006 Japanese-only EP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/cribs-arigato-cockers-lp-review.html"&gt;Arigato Cockers&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Apparently that EP is hard to get, so I consider myself lucky for having a copy and I guess I can't really fault their inclusion on this collection.&amp;nbsp; The songs from the era of MNWNW are excellent and deserve more coverage than they receive, but unfortunately for me the only one I did not already have was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Replacements_%28band%29"&gt;The Replacements&lt;/a&gt;' cover "Bastards of Young".&amp;nbsp; I did not have any of the included songs from the era of the last two LPs, and although I already have "Curse This English Rain", I don't see how one could exclude this excellent song twice: once on "Ignore the Ignorant" and now on "Payola".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also disappointed in how they treated the non-LP singles.&amp;nbsp; "Your Gonna Lose Us" and "Don't You Want to Be Relevant" are excellent songs, but they should appear on disc 1.&amp;nbsp; Also, the single-sided 7" from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs#Ignore_the_Ignorant_.282009.E2.80.932010.29"&gt;Johnny Marr-era&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-Housewife/release/2564551"&gt;Housewife&lt;/a&gt;", is still effectively unavailable -- that should be on disc 1 as well. Speaking of Johnny Marr, "Leather Jacket Love Song" is the last song he recorded with The Cribs and it is excellent -- this should have been a single in its own right.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in addition to the one unreleased song, I already had 10/18 of the songs on disc 2, and I'm no closer to getting copies of the really obscure songs from 2004 &amp;amp; 2005.&amp;nbsp; So while "Payola" is welcome, it is also a bit frustrating that the collection falls short of what it could have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: nearly all of them, but here is a list of songs not covered in other reviews: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24biqioepO0"&gt;Leather Jacket Love Song&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.nme.com/nme-video/song-stories---the-cribs-leather-jacket-love-song/2172824873001"&gt;live version for NME&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpyYx1OTttU"&gt;Fairer Sex&lt;/a&gt;" (2007 live version; Payola has the studio version), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRNgjKr6ys"&gt;Get Yr Hands Out Of My Grave&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFHIANOs4nE"&gt;Bastards of Young&lt;/a&gt;" (2007 live version; Payola has the studio version), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz8-jhma0r8"&gt;Glandular Fever Got The Best Of Me&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEs3UDx4Vk"&gt;On A Hotel Wall&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 8/10.&amp;nbsp; I wish they had included some of the earlier leather jacket love songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.B. Yes, I have not yet reviewed "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-In-The-Belly-Of-The-Brazen-Bull/master/437455"&gt;In the Belly of the Brazen Bull&lt;/a&gt;" or "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-Live-At-The-Brudenell-Social-Club/release/1594885"&gt;Live at the Brudenell Social Club&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; I'm working on it.</content>

    <title>Dale Watson - "Quick Quick, Slow Slow" (spotlight)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.344996+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Qj9v2uSCoAk/UTtWySCF1pI/AAAAAAAAA4A/9V02ffG4PVg/s1600/dale-watson.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="169" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Qj9v2uSCoAk/UTtWySCF1pI/AAAAAAAAA4A/9V02ffG4PVg/s320/dale-watson.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Today is the first Saturday of &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/schedule"&gt;SXSW 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and it was a year ago today that I last saw Lee Dirks.&amp;nbsp; On March 10, 2012 I attended one day of SXSW&amp;nbsp; with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jlbollen"&gt;Johan Bollen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/epistemographer"&gt;Josh Greenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iceskatingbears"&gt;Margy Avery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ldirks"&gt;Lee Dirks&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&amp;nbsp; They were on a panel about "&lt;a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP10546"&gt;data visualization and the future of research&lt;/a&gt;", which was a great success, but of course the highlight of the trip was city of Austin itself.&amp;nbsp; I won't try to explain &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_by_Southwest"&gt;SXSW&lt;/a&gt;, other than to say it's a big deal.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, Austin is plenty of fun by itself, and the net result of SXSW for us was all ten of Austin's taxis were unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the time leading up to SXSW, Lee acted as the social director, coordinating with everyone via email to compress a week's worth of activities into a single weekend in Austin: places to eat, drink, and of course catch some live music.&amp;nbsp; What to do on Saturday night was of course one of the main topics.&amp;nbsp; One option he put forward was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I was thinking another road trip...down to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruene_Hall"&gt;Greune Hall&lt;/a&gt; (Texas' oldest continuously running dancehall) to see the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ely"&gt;Joe Ely&lt;/a&gt; Band.&amp;nbsp; If people like this idea, we'll want to jump on tickets now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I replied:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Joe Ely? on a Saturday Night?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl1Zw3oqnkQ"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl1Zw3oqnkQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;to which Lee replied:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Well played on the Ely clip.&amp;nbsp; Well played, sir.&lt;br /&gt;-jld&lt;/blockquote&gt;That's some pretty obscure fan boy humor, but Lee and I connected on that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of seeing Joe Ely*, the group voted instead for catching the critically acclaimed, Austin-based, alt-country legend &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Watson_%28singer%29"&gt;Dale Watson&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.brokenspokeaustintx.com/"&gt;Broken Spoke&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp; Also an Austin legend, The Broken Spoke is on the outskirts of town, the kind of place that you assume only exists in movies.&amp;nbsp; Danette had been to the Broken Spoke on one of her business trips and had told me all about it.&amp;nbsp; So while I was somewhat prepared for what awaited me, the honky tonk that time forgot was an experience all its own.&amp;nbsp; The song that was playing when we walked in was "Quick Quick, Slow Slow".&amp;nbsp; I can't find &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Dale+Watson"&gt;which LP&lt;/a&gt;, if any, has this song; I don't know why that song stuck in my mind but it did, and it came to represent the entire experience for me.&amp;nbsp; We were there for maybe 2 hours, and towards the end Lee came up to me as I was standing by myself near the stage and asked with a smile "what do you think?".&amp;nbsp; I smiled and replied "it is everything I hoped it would be."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Although we exchanged emails several times before &lt;a href="http://leeandjudy.wordpress.com/"&gt;he and his wife Judy&lt;/a&gt; died in an accident while vacationing in Peru in August 2012, that was the last time I saw Lee.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href="http://storify.com/lljohnston/lee-dirks-and-judy-lew-dirks-memorial"&gt;tributes&lt;/a&gt; that followed were many and moving, with many focusing on his considerable impact and influence within the scholarly communication community.&amp;nbsp; While he and I had that connection, we always eventually steered our conversation to things like our mutual admiration of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer"&gt;Joe Strummer&lt;/a&gt; and our shared frustration of how people use "bbq" as a verb and not a noun (e.g., "what you're doing is called `grilling'...").&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had less than 48 hours in Austin that weekend, but it was a great time largely in part due to Lee insuring we all had great places to go.&amp;nbsp; There were a lot of memories, including being Johan's "plus one" at a reception (he was insufferable after that).&amp;nbsp; Many of the folks are shown below, but I regret that I did not take any pictures that weekend -- who really thinks this will be their last opportunity to do so?&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cT3HopLTZjI/UTusVsIUQCI/AAAAAAAAA4U/VIUMvXESA_Y/s1600/lee-dirks-sxsw.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cT3HopLTZjI/UTusVsIUQCI/AAAAAAAAA4U/VIUMvXESA_Y/s320/lee-dirks-sxsw.jpeg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dale Watson - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOWOIU8sb14"&gt;Quick Quick, Slow Slow&lt;/a&gt;" --&amp;nbsp;  This video is from 2009, but the point about places like The Broken  Spoke is they don't change much, so this is pretty similar to the  experience we had that night (although on March 10, 2012 the fiddle player was a woman).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want more Broken Spoke?&amp;nbsp; This video describes how they make &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtfT1WapP_o"&gt;chicken fried steak&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We didn't eat there that night, but if I go back I'll make a point to.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It's been almost two weeks since I've mentioned &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/The%20Clash"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt;, so I'll point out that Joe Ely sings back up on "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Should_I_Stay_or_Should_I_Go"&gt;Should I Stay or Should I Go?&lt;/a&gt;" just so I can check that box.&amp;nbsp; I'll also mention that I could make the Joe Ely reference because &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/scott.kinkade.58"&gt;Scott Kinkade&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to the music of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Dale_Gilmore"&gt;Jimmie Dale Gilmore &lt;/a&gt;~1992, but that's a story for another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>The Rave Ups - "Positively Lost Me" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345010+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kkft3galLiI/UTP_gQZyNAI/AAAAAAAAA3w/MB7LakK0qDk/s1600/rave-ups.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kkft3galLiI/UTP_gQZyNAI/AAAAAAAAA3w/MB7LakK0qDk/s200/rave-ups.png" height="135" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/orchestral-manoeuvres-in-dark-so-in.html"&gt;previously mentioned&lt;/a&gt; the juggernaut that was the 1986 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_%28soundtrack%29"&gt;Pretty in Pink Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, but did you know that one of the arguably better songs from the movie did not even make the cut for the soundtrack?&amp;nbsp; "Positively Lost Me" was from the 1985 LP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Rave-Ups-Town-And-Country/master/352978"&gt;Town + Country&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rave-Ups"&gt;The Rave Ups&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The band was featured in the movie, in the bar scene where the four main characters meet up, and "Positively Lost Me" was one of the two songs they played in the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfect 80s pop break-up song, I love how the song builds &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858849764/"&gt;a line at a time&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;You lost a lot when you lost me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You lost a lot when you lost me&lt;br /&gt;Six paperback books and a dying tree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You lost a lot when you lost me&lt;br /&gt;Six paperback books and a dying tree&lt;br /&gt;A looking glass and a diamond ring, yeah&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;You lost a lot when you lost me&lt;br /&gt;Six paperback books and a dying tree&lt;br /&gt;A looking glass and a diamond ring&lt;br /&gt;You lost me and you lost some dreams&lt;/blockquote&gt;How did this song get left off the soundtrack?&amp;nbsp; How did this song not become a huge hit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Positively Lost Me": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfdcbZxzKWc"&gt;studio version with movie footage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpF_FLBl1KM"&gt;2011 live version&lt;/a&gt; (they still have it, all that is missing are Duckie &amp;amp; Iona in the foreground -- you didn't identify with Andie or Blane, did you?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honorable mention: the brief snippet of "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPPCPjpkgkM"&gt;Rave Up, Shut Up&lt;/a&gt;" that also appeared in the movie.</content>

    <title>Damian Marley - "Welcome To Jamrock" (spotlight)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345024+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hjkVwQPyQpE/USjk9j7gdJI/AAAAAAAAA3M/wGdyKIiW-3Q/s1600/damian-marley-welcome-to-jamrock.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hjkVwQPyQpE/USjk9j7gdJI/AAAAAAAAA3M/wGdyKIiW-3Q/s200/damian-marley-welcome-to-jamrock.jpg" height="200" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In this post, in my best &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29"&gt;James Burke&lt;/a&gt; impression, we'll go from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley"&gt;Bob Marley&lt;/a&gt; to "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady"&gt;My Fair Lady&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riding around in the car earlier this week, &lt;a href="http://www.96x.fm/"&gt;96.1&lt;/a&gt; played a song that I had never heard before.&amp;nbsp; It was crossover of dub/reggae/rap, but with a hard enough sound to warrant play on an alt rock station. After parking, I pulled out my iphone and discovered that it was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Marley"&gt;Damian Marley&lt;/a&gt;'s&amp;nbsp; "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Jamrock_%28song%29"&gt;Welcome To Jamrock&lt;/a&gt;" ("Jamrock" being used as an umbrella term for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae"&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehall"&gt;dancehall&lt;/a&gt;, and other Jamaican musical genres).&amp;nbsp; Although I had never heard it before, I discovered that it came out in 2005 and its YouTube video had 25M+ views, so clearly it had been important somewhere, but just not on the local alt rock radio.&amp;nbsp; So why did 96.1 play it:&amp;nbsp; experimenting with their playlist?&amp;nbsp; recognition from Damian performing at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Grammy_Awards#Performers"&gt;2013 Grammys&lt;/a&gt; (even though this song was not featured)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure why they played it, but I liked it.&amp;nbsp; Sampling the 1984 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ini_Kamoze"&gt;Ini Kamoze&lt;/a&gt; song "World a Music (Out In The Streets They Call It Merther)", the &lt;a href="http://rapgenius.com/Damian-marley-welcome-to-jamrock-lyrics"&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; (slang and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_Patois"&gt;Patois&lt;/a&gt; delivered in a thick accent) were all but undecipherable, but upon reading the meaning is clear: Jamaica is gripped with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Jamaica"&gt;poverty, violence, and despair&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Damian is the son of Bob Marley, and whereas his father had a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari_movement#Reggae"&gt;hopeful, spiritual message&lt;/a&gt; for Jamaica, the son's message is one of bleak, gritty realism, e.g.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;C'mon let's face it, a ghetto education's basic&lt;br /&gt;And most ah de youths them waste it&lt;br /&gt;And when dem waste it, that's when dem take the guns replace it&lt;br /&gt;Then dem don't stand a chance at all&lt;/blockquote&gt;What made my belated discovery of "Welcome To Jamrock" more interesting is that it was only a few days after really discovering "Safe European Home" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I've written a lot about The Clash, but I (and most others I believe) have overlooked their 1978 sophomore LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_%27Em_Enough_Rope"&gt;Give 'Em Enough Rope&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; It's not a bad LP, but it doesn't really have any memorable singles and is overshadowed by their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash_(album)"&gt;first LP&lt;/a&gt; (by virtue of being first) and their third, 1979's iconic "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Calling"&gt;London Calling&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; The first song on the LP is "Safe European Home", and it is arguably the best song on the LP.&amp;nbsp; But the &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/52924/"&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; are nearly as indecipherable as "Welcome To Jamrock", so only last week did I really sit down and study them.&amp;nbsp; I've mentioned before where The Clash spearheaded &lt;a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/punkhistory/reggae.htm"&gt;punk's interest in reggae&lt;/a&gt;, but "Safe European Home" is the story of their bad experiences on an early trip to Jamaica, the reality of which did not match the tourism image:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Wasn't I lucky n' &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wouldn%27t_It_Be_Loverly"&gt;wouldn't it be loverly&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Send us all cards, an' have a laying in on a Sunday&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;I was there for two weeks, so how come I never tell&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;That &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natty_Dread"&gt;natty dread&lt;/a&gt; drinks at the Sheraton hotel?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they got the sun, an' they got the palm trees&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;They got the weed, an' they got the taxis&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Whoa, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harder_They_Come_%28soundtrack%29"&gt;the harder they come&lt;/a&gt;, n' the home of ol' &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Beat_Records"&gt;bluebeat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I'd stay an' be a tourist but I can't take the gun play&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/blockquote&gt;So despite both "Welcome to Jamrock" and "Safe European Home" existing for quite some time, I somehow managed to "discover" them both in the space of a few days.&amp;nbsp; Apparently little has changed in Jamaica in the nearly 30 years between The Clash's initial visit and Damian's dirge.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The connection to "My Fair Lady"?&amp;nbsp; Danette pointed out the sly "wouldn't it be loverly" reference in "Safe European Home", "loverly" reflecting &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer"&gt;Joe Strummer&lt;/a&gt;'s adopted &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney"&gt;Cockney&lt;/a&gt;, blue-collar focus. &amp;nbsp; How many punk songs do you know that sneak in a Broadway reference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the "My Fair Lady" reference, the last minute of "Safe European Home" also gives us a preview of a song to come: note the the "Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, ... Rudie Can't Fail" lyrics, which would become a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudie_Can%27t_Fail"&gt;song of its own&lt;/a&gt; on "London Calling" ("Rudie" = "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rude_boy"&gt;Rude Boy&lt;/a&gt;"). &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damian Marley: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GZlJGERbvE"&gt;Welcome To Jamrock&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clash: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_6UTZb-_vI"&gt;Safe European Home&lt;/a&gt;" (studio), "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhLixUPbvqo"&gt;Safe European Home&lt;/a&gt;" (live from the 1980 "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rude_Boy_%28film%29"&gt;Rude Boy&lt;/a&gt;" film; note that Joe Strummer often improvised lyrics during live performances) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Strummer &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mescaleros"&gt;The Mescaleros&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tld1lh6rG_Q"&gt;Safe European Home&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ini Kamoze: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eihB9xXNRw4"&gt;World a Music (Out In The Streets They Call It Merther)&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn"&gt;Audrey Hepburn&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q671QIDeH-U"&gt;Wouldn't It Be Loverly&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews"&gt;Julie Andrews&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ipgrp_xLU"&gt;Wouldn't It Be Loverly&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

I  mean, being from Los Angeles and, you know, growing up and surrounded by  Mexican culture, it just kind of happened."&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm not qualified to evaluate this song as mariachi music, but it sure is fun.&amp;nbsp; And the b-side of this single?&amp;nbsp; A mariachi cover of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Would_Die_4_U" title="I Would Die 4 U"&gt;I Would Die 4 U&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; That's right: a punk band masquerading as a mariachi band, covering Prince. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mariachi El Bronx: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWe_UiWhoWE"&gt;Cell Mates&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZimIJDO8o"&gt;I Would Die 4 U&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do they normally sound like?&amp;nbsp; The Bronx: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnklQt3eHpQ"&gt;Shitty Future&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKa3l9R3ZI"&gt;False Alarm&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>Beyonce - "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" (the song remains the same)</title>

    <title>Ass Ponys - "Little Bastard" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345065+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vLTDkeDoPRQ/UQ1CEoVno9I/AAAAAAAAA1s/oS_ZUyzY5VQ/s1600/ass-ponys-little-bastard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vLTDkeDoPRQ/UQ1CEoVno9I/AAAAAAAAA1s/oS_ZUyzY5VQ/s200/ass-ponys-little-bastard.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Do you remember this one?&amp;nbsp; Danette swears she's never heard it before, but I'm certain it got a tiny bit of airplay when it came out in 1994.&amp;nbsp; "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Ass-Ponys-Little-Bastard/release/3012254"&gt;Little Bastard&lt;/a&gt;" was the single from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ass_Ponys"&gt;Ass Ponys&lt;/a&gt;'s LP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Ass-Ponys-Electric-Rock-Music/master/81859"&gt;Electric Rock Music&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Not a lot of airplay, mind you, but it obviously stuck with me enough to remember some nearly 20 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based in Ohio, I don't think the Ass Ponys ever made it big.&amp;nbsp; Vocalist Chuck Cleaver later formed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wussy"&gt;Wussy&lt;/a&gt;, who I think I've heard of but their biggest accomplishment seems to be the undying admiration of veteran rock critic &lt;a href="http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=wussy"&gt;Robert Christgau&lt;/a&gt;, who is entranced by Chuck's stories of off-kilter Americana.&amp;nbsp; I've never seem him praise an entire discography like that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to "Little Bastard": this quirky, jangly, catchy song (&amp;amp; video) is a perfect mid-90s time capsule.&amp;nbsp; It makes me want to grow my goatee again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He said, `don't call me little bastard / call me snake...'"&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ass Ponys: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VTBam8YzQg"&gt;Little Bastard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>This Mortal Coil - "Song to the Siren" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345079+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m_ip7A2ZUOU/UQSWPCQZE7I/AAAAAAAAA1M/5jMfrmM9yMY/s1600/tmc-song-to-the-siren.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m_ip7A2ZUOU/UQSWPCQZE7I/AAAAAAAAA1M/5jMfrmM9yMY/s200/tmc-song-to-the-siren.jpeg" width="198" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've already given a short summary of the history and focus of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Mortal_Coil"&gt;This Moral Coil&lt;/a&gt; in my review of their initial 1983 EP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/10/this-mortal-coil-sixteen-daysgathering.html"&gt;Sixteen Days/Gathering Dust&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Originally the B-side to the EP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_to_the_Siren_(Tim_Buckley_song)"&gt;Song to the Siren&lt;/a&gt;" was so well-received that it became the A-side to the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/This-Mortal-Coil-Song-To-The-Siren/master/17459"&gt;7" single&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In part through use in commercials, "Song to the Siren" became a moderate hit (in relative terms, anyway) for This Mortal Coil.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally written by folk singer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Buckley"&gt;Tim Buckley&lt;/a&gt;, my first exposure was the TMC verison.&amp;nbsp; But I've only recently discovered the many other versions of this song.&amp;nbsp; Here is an incomplete list in roughly chronological order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Buckley - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMTEtDBHGY4"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pxvXI1i9cw"&gt;studio 1970&lt;/a&gt;: Danette pointed out the original, folk version is midway between Pat Boone's and TMC's.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Boone"&gt;Pat Boone&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gH3Z6BOCco"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;: No, really.&amp;nbsp; A disturbingly bland, lifeless version.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TMC - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mUmdR69nbM"&gt;studio 1983&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP2vw189q4U"&gt;live 1983&lt;/a&gt;: The canonical version; Elizabeth Fraser turns in an achingly beautiful rendition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_and_Naomi"&gt;Damon &amp;amp; Naomi&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_uY84iZRFQ"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;: The former &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxie_500"&gt;Galaxie 500&lt;/a&gt; members give a trademark &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowcore"&gt;slowcore&lt;/a&gt; version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O%27Connor"&gt;Sinead O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88wL8oRf45U"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;: Clearly inspired by the TMC version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ferry"&gt;Bryan Ferry&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqgIZCw-lbI"&gt;studio 2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4KC9Vr6x7Y"&gt;live 2010&lt;/a&gt;: This sounds exactly like you'd expect a Bryan Ferry version to sound like.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Perry"&gt;Brendan Perry&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4en3W5U1yo"&gt;live 2011&lt;/a&gt;: Perry is 1/2 of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Can_Dance"&gt;Dead Can Dance&lt;/a&gt;, who were a central figure in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4AD_Records"&gt;4AD&lt;/a&gt; / TMC sound. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>School of Seven Bells - "Ghostory" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345093+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Or8u6yei4oI/UPN1f0JtAWI/AAAAAAAAA0s/wd-4NiSG_I0/s1600/school-of-seven-bells-ghostory.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Or8u6yei4oI/UPN1f0JtAWI/AAAAAAAAA0s/wd-4NiSG_I0/s200/school-of-seven-bells-ghostory.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.davidbyrne.com/"&gt;David Byrne&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2010/02/021410-valentines-day.html"&gt;TED talk about music in context&lt;/a&gt;: how music is shaped by the environment in which it is intended to be experienced.&amp;nbsp; Music intended for the outdoors, dive bars, concert halls, etc. are best experienced in those environments and do not necessarily translate well into other environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is more to his argument and I encourage you to read it (his &lt;a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; is always engaging on a variety of topics, only a few of which are about music), but I'll use context as the motivation for this review.&amp;nbsp; Less than a year ago I was driving in my car and listening to &lt;a href="http://www.96x.fm/"&gt;96.1&lt;/a&gt;, pretty much the only local option for alternative music on the radio, not counting specific shows on public radio like "&lt;a href="http://dimensions.whro.org/index.php/all-articles/112-out-of-the-box-with-paul-shugrue.html"&gt;Out of the Box&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now keep in mind that the definition of "alternative" is contextually dependent as well.&amp;nbsp; 96.1 is a pretty good station, but they have to sell commercials like everybody else and the Hampton Roads market isn't that big, so there is a definite limit to just how "alternative" things get.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I heard "Lafaye" (it was either that or "Love Play") from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Seven_Bells"&gt;School of Seven Bells&lt;/a&gt; on the car radio, it caught my attention.&amp;nbsp; I fired up my iphone app to find out who it was and made a note of it for future exploration.&amp;nbsp; "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostory_%28album%29"&gt;Ghostory&lt;/a&gt;" is the third LP from the band, but somehow I had not heard of them.&amp;nbsp; The band has an interesting story: originally &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Curtis_(musician)"&gt;Benjamin Curtis&lt;/a&gt; and identical twins &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On!Air!Library!"&gt;Claudia and Alejandra Deheza&lt;/a&gt;, "Ghostory" is their first LP without Claudia.&amp;nbsp; I did some reading and sampled some YouTube videos, and then added the LP to my next Amazon order.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here's the point about context: the threshold for "cool" and "alternative" is apparently much lower in my car radio than it is in my home collection.&amp;nbsp; "Ghostory" is not a bad LP, and there really aren't any bad songs.&amp;nbsp; But what sounded so engaging while driving around town is really just a by-the-numbers imitation &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocteau_Twins"&gt;Cocteau Twins&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with productions values updated by 20+ years.&amp;nbsp; I love the Cocteau Twins (and the whole &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4AD"&gt;4AD&lt;/a&gt; sound) but if you have some of the more accessible Cocteau Twins LPs like "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_or_Las_Vegas"&gt;Heaven or Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;", you're not going to hear anything new on "Ghostory".&amp;nbsp; It's all there: ethereal vocals, otherworldly soundscapes, the dreamy soundtrack for some yet-unmade film; the notable exception is that Alejandra does not convey the joy that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Fraser"&gt;Elizabeth Fraser&lt;/a&gt; brings to the Cocteau Twins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, reviews by &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16337-ghostory/"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16748/reviews/4144516"&gt;Drowned in Sound&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://stereogum.com/963312/album-of-the-week-school-of-seven-bells-ghostory/top-stories/"&gt;Stereogum&lt;/a&gt; all miss the CT/4AD similarity. To me it could not be any more obvious than if they had named the LP "Remixed Ghosts of Heaven or Las Vegas".&amp;nbsp; One of the reviews points out that "Ghostory" is a concept LP about a woman named "Lafaye" and the "ghosts" in her life... screw it, I'm already bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASTWLPUM-2g"&gt;Love Play&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUrQnDVWXvo"&gt;Lafaye&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww2GvE9GoDs"&gt;Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4eJ6StZhC4"&gt;live, acoustic version&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other songs: most are available in this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA68A27AA0D6377ED"&gt;YouTube playlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 6/10.&amp;nbsp; With a nod to David Byrne, "Innovative in Michael's Car" != "Innovative in Michael's Home".&amp;nbsp; Suitable for background listening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocteau Twins Bonus links: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j65v7OqlW6I"&gt;Heaven or Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K7bS91yVn8"&gt;Frou Frou Foxes in Midsummer Fires&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk8vSw94jFA"&gt;I Wear Your Ring&lt;/a&gt;" -- see my point?</content>

Second, owning easily a linear foot or more of his &lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/discography"&gt;considerable discography&lt;/a&gt;, I'm no casual DJ Shadow fan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, now I'll begin with a slight detour.&amp;nbsp; A while back we watched &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Smith"&gt;Kevin Smith&lt;/a&gt;'s storytelling special "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Smith:_Too_Fat_for_40"&gt;Too Fat For 40&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Paraphrasing from memory, Smith said something to the effect that classic films like "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerks_%28film%29"&gt;Clerks&lt;/a&gt;" (1994) and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_Amy"&gt;Chasing Amy&lt;/a&gt;" (1997) were the kind of films the he could make in his early- and mid-20s, based on who he was and where he was but the successful, 40 year old Kevin Smith simply can't make those kinds of films again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't help but compare Kevin Smith to Josh Davis, aka &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow"&gt;DJ Shadow.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Perhaps DJ Shadow simply can no longer make landmarks like 1996's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endtroducing....."&gt;Endtroducing.....&lt;/a&gt;" or 1994's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/05/dj-shadow-what-does-your-soul-look-like.html"&gt;What Does Your Soul Look Like&lt;/a&gt;", both of which Davis also made in his early- and mid-20s.&amp;nbsp; DJ Shadow has stated many times that he wants to move on from "Endtroducing....." and not be stuck in that rut.&amp;nbsp; I get &amp;amp; respect that; however, it has just occurred to me that's he stuck in another rut, an anti-"Entroducing....." rut.&amp;nbsp; "The Less You Know, The Better" is simply "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Press"&gt;The Private Press&lt;/a&gt;", take 3*. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Private Press" is where Shadow introduced his current stripped-down, sparse sound.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't as dense, and incorporated fewer samples and instead focused on more subtle changes (not unlike &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Hawtin"&gt;Plastikman&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; It worked on "The Private Press" (which I admit didn't fully make sense to me until it was paired with 2003's remix LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Repress"&gt;The Private Repress&lt;/a&gt;"), in part because all the songs had a unified vision (which I can only describe using words like "clinical" or "antiseptic").&amp;nbsp; "The Outsider" continued that sound, but with an unfocused or unclear vision and too many guests, many of whom were -- let me check my desk reference, yes I can use this phrase -- "&lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sucka%20mc"&gt;sucka MCs&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately there are no sucka MCs on TLYKTB.&amp;nbsp; But the lack of focus is still a problem; it is almost as if Shadow approached this LP like it was a mix LP and points were awarded for clever genre-bending.&amp;nbsp; In comparison, 1998's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psyence_Fiction"&gt;Psyence Fiction&lt;/a&gt;" was a grab bag of guest artists and their different styles, but the unifying theme could be classified as "the soundtrack to the weird sci-fi movie that only &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lavelle"&gt;James Lavelle&lt;/a&gt; can see". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On TLYKTB, rather than prove his command of his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmrC41gnwjU"&gt;record collection&lt;/a&gt; by sampling from various genres for the creation of something entirely new, he's "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmrC41gnwjU#t=1m28s"&gt;adding to this pile, whether [he] wants to admit it or not&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Some examples:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ploXN6YFweE"&gt;Border Crossing&lt;/a&gt;" -- this sounds like the kind of uninspired hip-hop / metal cross over stuff that formed the basis of 1997's surprisingly bland "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_%28film%29#Soundtrack"&gt;Spawn: The Album&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; This song is very similar to "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Drtm6RKs_g"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt;" from "The Outsider" (that's bad); sadly this just doesn't slam like "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5rVw2SEqwk"&gt;Drums of Death&lt;/a&gt;" from "Psyence Fiction"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6m6pwBbg5w"&gt;I &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6m6pwBbg5w"&gt;Gotta Rokk&lt;/a&gt;" -- songs that talk about rocking typically don't; this does not compare favorably to, say, "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AznJpGpkDFM"&gt;The Number Song&lt;/a&gt;" which really does rock &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyudDPxd9Po"&gt;Sad and Lonely&lt;/a&gt;" -- this (and the remix, "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aFdT4n-nSc"&gt;(Not So) Sad and Lonely&lt;/a&gt;") would be right at home on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby"&gt;Moby&lt;/a&gt;'s 1999 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_%28Moby_album%29"&gt;Play&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n--lN-vT4C0"&gt;Warning Call&lt;/a&gt;" -- featuring &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Vek"&gt;Tom Vek&lt;/a&gt;, this could easily be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus_%28band%29"&gt;Bauhaus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Minds"&gt;Simple Minds&lt;/a&gt; collaborating on a track for a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_%28filmmaker%29"&gt;John Hughes&lt;/a&gt; memorial LP &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL9ypNz9-mM"&gt;Scale It Back&lt;/a&gt;" -- technically this is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Dragon"&gt;Little Dragon&lt;/a&gt; guesting on a DJ Shadow song, but this could easily be the other way around&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Some of the songs are pretty good: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBhcZhuq-tQ"&gt;Stay The Course&lt;/a&gt;" -- a pretty good song featuring &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talib_Kweli"&gt;Talib Kwei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Mercer"&gt;Posdnuous&lt;/a&gt;, but I can't help but compare it to prior &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solesides"&gt;Solesides&lt;/a&gt; offerings like "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr9T0vbJdJw"&gt;Alphabet Aerobics&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBKdzToyCVg"&gt;I've Been Trying&lt;/a&gt;" -- this first appeared on the 2010 "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/11/dj-shadow-def-surrounds-us-lp-review.html"&gt;Def Surrounds Us&lt;/a&gt;" single; as I noted then this sounds a lot like "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy-z8E2ldH8"&gt;Broken Levee Blues&lt;/a&gt;" from "The Outsider"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Back To Front (Circular Logic)", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6drKeO3gZOA"&gt;Tedium&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZaGICnfui0"&gt;Redeemed&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O8bGf0X9yU"&gt;Run For Your Life&lt;/a&gt;", and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP6jiT0zHcg"&gt;Circular Logic (Front To Back)&lt;/a&gt;" -- all good songs, and all would be comfortably at home on "The Private Press, esp. "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuCTxhSAi7s"&gt;Fixed Income&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMfECYsFKes"&gt;Monosylabik&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7rZGZLbsLs"&gt;You Can't Go Home Again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The worst song on here is "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayHlOjWKV4U"&gt;Give Me Back The Nights&lt;/a&gt;", based on a spoken word, teenage screed of unknown origin.&amp;nbsp; I can't tell if it is supposed to be serious or a &lt;a href="http://jakefogelnest.com/post/3129426421"&gt;humorous Corey Flood tribute&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't work in either context.&amp;nbsp; In 1994 he used a fevered &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/lost-and-found-sfl-mw0000958292"&gt;prison recording&lt;/a&gt; in the break for "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liNWlanaRRY"&gt;Lost and Found&lt;/a&gt;"; it made no sense either but was used to better effect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a good but not essential record. It does remove the bad taste of "The Outsider", but when I compare "The Less You Know, The Better" to recent innovative releases from artists like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stott"&gt;Andy Stott&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15971-we-stay-together/"&gt;We Stay Together&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/"&gt;Passed Me By&lt;/a&gt;") or &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/balamacab"&gt;Balam Acab&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2015/11/balam-acab-see-birds-lp-review.html"&gt;See Birds&lt;/a&gt;"), I can't help but think of a 40 year old Kevin Smith. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBhcZhuq-tQ"&gt;Stay The Course&lt;/a&gt;", "Back To Front (Circular Logic)", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6drKeO3gZOA"&gt;Tedium&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZaGICnfui0"&gt;Redeemed&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O8bGf0X9yU"&gt;Run For Your Life&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP6jiT0zHcg"&gt;Circular Logic (Front To Back)&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs:&amp;nbsp; "Give Me Back The Nights"  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: 6/10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link: DJ Shadow giving a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Fh1x17XT8"&gt;track-by-track summary for Billboard Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Reviews: &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/09/25/140643384/first-listen-dj-shadow-the-less-you-know-the-better"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.spin.com/reviews/dj-shadow-less-you-know-better-verve"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15900-the-less-you-know-the-better/"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-less-you-know-the-better/dj-shadow"&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* = An unkind reading of some of the song titles ("Stay The Course", "Tedium", "Going Nowhere", "I've Been Trying") suggests that at some level he knows he's recycling material.</content>

    <title>Waxing Poetics - "Blue-Eyed Soul" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345121+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O_YoDK94_U4/UOZWD-SnPpI/AAAAAAAAAzk/vmq405u3ANA/s1600/waxing-poetics-2012-12-30.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O_YoDK94_U4/UOZWD-SnPpI/AAAAAAAAAzk/vmq405u3ANA/s200/waxing-poetics-2012-12-30.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Danette and I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.waxingpoetics.net/"&gt;Waxing Poetics&lt;/a&gt; reunion show on December 30, 2012 @ The Norva.&amp;nbsp; They put on a really good show in front of a large crowd, and at nearly 2.5 hours long they must have played every song from their &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Waxing+Poetics"&gt;three studio LPs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't know, the Waxing Poetics were a Norfolk-based band active from 1983-1991.&amp;nbsp; Periodically they do reunion shows (here's an article about their &lt;a href="http://www.leftoffthedial.com/6_03FeatureWaxingPoetics.htm"&gt;2003 reunion show&lt;/a&gt;), but for the most part they are dormant.&amp;nbsp; They had a few hits on the radio and were poised to make it big, but for some reason it never happened. The &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2012/12/waxing-poetics-readys-show-look-back"&gt;Virginian Pilot&lt;/a&gt; has a nice article explaining the history &amp;amp; significance of the band, and their relation to &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/09/rem-superman-song-remains-same.html"&gt;R.E.M.&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/caroltaylorwnor"&gt;Carol Taylor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;I never saw them live back in the day, so I was excited to finally see them, albeit ~25 years late.&amp;nbsp; Our first thought at looking at the band -- and the crowd that came to see the band -- was "who are these old people?!" It's a good thing we're not that old... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their biggest LP was 1988's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Waxing-Poetics-Manakin-Moon/master/295440"&gt;Manakin Moon&lt;/a&gt;", and that LP featured their biggest single was "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUOEnS5HB0c"&gt;Baby Jane&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; My personal favorite song was "Blue-Eyed Soul" (also from the same LP), which they did a crunching version of near the end of their first set.&amp;nbsp; And for a brief period, it was 1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue-Eyed Soul: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13u0IEigLZg"&gt;live 1990&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.defenestration.net/defenmusic/The%20Waxing%20Poetics/Manakin%20Moon/slides/Blue-Eyed%20Soul.html"&gt;studio &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Zomes - "Earth Grid" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345135+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GaZkGL1GxQg/UN27nRHrQ5I/AAAAAAAAAzE/ku9lrUFviIo/s1600/zomes-earth-grid.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="191" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GaZkGL1GxQg/UN27nRHrQ5I/AAAAAAAAAzE/ku9lrUFviIo/s200/zomes-earth-grid.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;About a year ago I covered the 2008 self-titled debut LP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/12/zomes-zomes-lp-review.html"&gt;Zomes&lt;/a&gt;", the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_music"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt; alias for &lt;a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/artists/?id=11877"&gt;Asa Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; His second LP as Zomes, 2011's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Zomes-Earth-Grid/master/425014"&gt;Earth Grid&lt;/a&gt;" is very similar in structure, but with minor differences in the resulting sound.&amp;nbsp; I have to confess I liked the fuzzier, more distorted sound of the first LP, but really these two LPs are interchangeable.&amp;nbsp; I still haven't thought of a better description than from last year's review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;If &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Shields"&gt;Kevin Shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno"&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass"&gt;Phillip Glass&lt;/a&gt; listened to a bunch of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramones"&gt;Ramones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop"&gt;Iggy Pop&lt;/a&gt; LPs and then went on a weekend recording bender, it would sound like this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm not going to try to improve on it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, there are a number of effusive reviews that do a better job at capturing the essence of this LP: &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15381-earth-grid/"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/Zomes-Earth-Grid"&gt;Tiny Mix Tapes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Zomes/Earth-Grid"&gt;Thrill Jockey&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; And to be fair, here's a review from &lt;a href="http://spectrumculture.com/2011/05/zomes-earth-grid.html/"&gt;Spectrum Culture&lt;/a&gt; from someone who doesn't care for the genre.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: Again, this kind of LP doesn't lend it self to picking out individual songs.&amp;nbsp; The entire LP is available on &lt;a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/search/song?q=Zomes+Earth+Grid"&gt;GrooveShark&lt;/a&gt;, and only a few selections are on YouTube: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJBTlkWY2M"&gt;Pilgrim Traveler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtoXv4OqpEQ"&gt;Alec's Anthem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 8/10.&amp;nbsp; I gave the first LP a 9/10, and since I have a slight preference for the first LP I'm giving this one an 8/10.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMmSSr7hk8k"&gt;live 2010&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>Matt and Kim - "Daylight" (spotlight)</title>

She wasn't familiar with them, so we started talking about their song from the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0rx1srLsh0"&gt;Bacardi commercial&lt;/a&gt;, etc. I wish I was cool enough to say that I had heard of them before that, but alas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Daylight" is the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Matt-And-Kim-Daylight/release/1743442"&gt;lead single&lt;/a&gt; off their 2009 sophomore LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_%28Matt_%26_Kim_album%29"&gt;Grand&lt;/a&gt;" (the single itself was released in 2008).&amp;nbsp; This song is just pure joy set to music, and the video is equally clever and charming (check out the stop motion work starting at ~2:12).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino have a formula, and as a drums &amp;amp; synth &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-it-yourself"&gt;DIY&lt;/a&gt;  duo there is a limit to the variation you get from them, but it's a good formula and their attitude is infectious so why mess with what works.&amp;nbsp; Their &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mattandkim"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; is filled with gems, but "Daylight" is a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daylight: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgBeu3FVi60"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt;, live on the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHTceurgOf8"&gt;Daily Habit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxlHzyj3QVc"&gt;live 2012&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWcftcWIrE"&gt;2009 live debut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDVWhaQq-7I"&gt;2010 live&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>The Dave Brubeck Quartet - "Time Out" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345163+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lS6BwcWgCCQ/UMAVtOQi9nI/AAAAAAAAAx4/ClDMM_N-as0/s1600/dave-brubeck-time-out.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="199" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lS6BwcWgCCQ/UMAVtOQi9nI/AAAAAAAAAx4/ClDMM_N-as0/s200/dave-brubeck-time-out.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've been meaning to include some jazz classics in the blog, but I've always been intimidated: 1) I'm a jazz dilettante, and 2) is there any genre of music with a greater ratio of "words written" to "minutes recorded"?&amp;nbsp; And since "What Michael Doesn't Know About Jazz" is a pretty long book, what could I possibly say that hasn't been said before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been thinking about "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Blue"&gt;Kind of Blue&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketches_of_Spain"&gt;Sketches of Spain&lt;/a&gt;", or "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Train_%28album%29"&gt;Blue Train&lt;/a&gt;", but &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/manager-jazz-composer-pianist-dave-brubeck-dies-170407395.html"&gt;Dave Brubeck's passing&lt;/a&gt; today made the choice of "Time Out" an easy one.&amp;nbsp; If you want to read about why this LP was such a leap forward and how it became a universally accepted classic, read the &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/r136015/review"&gt;Allmusic review&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_%28album%29"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I'll tell you my involvement with this LP goes back to an early teenager rifling through my father's LPs and ultimately commandeering it for my collection.&amp;nbsp; If I recall correctly, he got this LP from one of his brothers; Jack is older, but Douglas was the family audiophile.&amp;nbsp; Even as a teenager (knowing even less about jazz than I now do) I was captivated by "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Rondo_%C3%A0_la_Turk"&gt;Blue Rondo a la Turk&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Much later in life I read about the rarity of 9/8 time, but ~30 years ago I just knew it sounded unlike anything else I had heard.&amp;nbsp; It was even later in life when I realized that the LP's real masterpiece is the smoky, cool "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Five"&gt;Take Five&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; That's not to slight the other songs on this LP, but you haven't really heard jazz until you've heard these two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few LPs that I have on both vinyl (from the early family collection) and CD.&amp;nbsp; It might have been soon after college when I purchased the CD (I'm not entirely sure, but I probably had to have had a job to afford the luxury of purchasing a CD for something I already had on vinyl), but I still recall my first time hearing the vinyl.&amp;nbsp; 50+ years later, this LP still sounds modern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand out songs: "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2htbaJFEAXQ"&gt;Blue Rondo a la Turk&lt;/a&gt;" (live 1962), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faJE92phKzI"&gt;Take Five&lt;/a&gt;" (live 1966)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full LP: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9E722C19437EF0CA"&gt;YouTube playlist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://grooveshark.com/album/Dave+Brubeck+Time+Out/7851042"&gt;grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>The Beach Boys - "Heroes and Villains" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345177+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RwDSeHN5Q7k/ULoYUiUbdYI/AAAAAAAAAxY/VRquzTlwFuI/s1600/beach-boys-heroes-and-villains.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RwDSeHN5Q7k/ULoYUiUbdYI/AAAAAAAAAxY/VRquzTlwFuI/s200/beach-boys-heroes-and-villains.jpeg" width="198" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For most people, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys"&gt;The Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt; discography mysteriously ends in 1966 with "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-beach-boys-good-vibrations-song.html"&gt;Good Vibrations&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Largely forgotten is the single that followed, 1967's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_and_Villains"&gt;Heroes and Villains&lt;/a&gt;", conceived as the center piece of the aborted "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(The_Beach_Boys_album)"&gt;SMiLE&lt;/a&gt;" project that devolved into the less ambitious "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley_Smile"&gt;Smiley Smile&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; The single failed to duplicate the success of "Good Vibrations" and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_and_Villains#Effect_on_Brian_Wilson"&gt;Brian Wilson's subsequent disappointment&lt;/a&gt; brought a messy end to the &lt;a href="http://wnew.radio.com/2009/06/19/rock-101-the-beatles-vs-the-beach-boys/"&gt;friendly competition with The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It's a good song, but it really only makes sense in the larger context of SMiLE's cryptic theme of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28The_Beach_Boys_album%29#Original_themes_and_ideas"&gt;journey across America&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poking around on YouTube the other day, I was surprised to find the number of different videos for the song that most people don't know exists.&amp;nbsp; It turns out that Capitol Records held a &lt;a href="http://tongal.com/project/Smile/overview"&gt;video contest&lt;/a&gt; for 2011's (re-)release of SMiLE, and many of the submissions found their way onto YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many arrangements, demos, outtakes, etc. of this song, but basically they fall into 2 general categories: the simpler, ~3 minute version from Smiley Smile, and the more complex, ~5 minute version from SMiLE.&amp;nbsp; The latter has the "cantina" break, and is often prepended with two opening acapella tracks "Our Prayer" and "Gee".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smiley Smile version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltXz42OT1Vg"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt; with surfing clips from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Clifton"&gt;Peter Clifton&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; ca. 1969&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c89JsIUPt78"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt; ca. 1972/1973 (Mike Love manages to ruin this version)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiuPxfV_Zqo"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt; ca. 1978 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50p8hryi4oA"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt; 2012 (not great, but you have to enjoy the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys_50th_Anniversary_Reunion_Tour"&gt;reunion performances&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/09/26/brian_wilson_dropped_from_beach_boys_tour_.html"&gt;Mike Love ruins those too&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMiLE version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVu7pyjG9AU"&gt;Brian Wilson solo live arrangement&lt;/a&gt; ca. 2004 (exceptionally good)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLDMZVoxw0"&gt;live action&lt;/a&gt; contest entry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptxwWt2JeGQ"&gt;winning contest entry&lt;/a&gt; (with obvious "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_%28film%29"&gt;Yellow Submarine&lt;/a&gt;" influences)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a surprisingly violent live action, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw6GNRdmx9Q"&gt;possible contest entry &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Saxon - "Princess of the Night" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345191+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sVG2f819T04/UJcpOhQ1WCI/AAAAAAAAAwo/7mGqIyxArsU/s1600/saxon-princess-of-the-night.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sVG2f819T04/UJcpOhQ1WCI/AAAAAAAAAwo/7mGqIyxArsU/s200/saxon-princess-of-the-night.jpeg" height="200" width="199" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;An early 1980s metal band, a song titled "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_of_the_Night"&gt;Princess of the Night&lt;/a&gt;", and ... it's about a train.&amp;nbsp; Because who hasn't asked themselves "why aren't there more love songs about trains?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_%28band%29"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; was a central figure in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NWOBHM"&gt;NWOBHM&lt;/a&gt; movement of the late 70s and early 80s, however they are all but forgotten today.&amp;nbsp; I have a handful of their LPs on vinyl stashed away somewhere, but aruably the best was their 1981 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim_and_Leather"&gt;Denim and Leather&lt;/a&gt;", from which "Princess of the Night" was a single.&amp;nbsp; I remember being enthralled by their video (and the NWOBHM sound) in the early days of MTV, but only now (nearly 30 years later) do I realize the visual similarities between this video and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qDgCmzh5ao"&gt;Spinal Tap&lt;/a&gt; (yikes!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while the 8-year old in me still likes steam trains (who doesn't?), I've transposed the song to a more personally applicable setting: every time I walk through a computer machine room, the second verse comes to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;She used to be an iron horse&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago&lt;br /&gt;Used to bring the mail to me&lt;br /&gt;Through the ice and snow&lt;br /&gt;I've sat alone and watched her&lt;br /&gt;Steaming through the night&lt;br /&gt;Ninety tons of thunder&lt;br /&gt;Lighting up the sky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speeding smokestack lightning&lt;br /&gt;Engine working hard&lt;br /&gt;Furnace and the footplate&lt;br /&gt;Shining in the night&lt;br /&gt;Iron striking metal&lt;br /&gt;The sound of racing steel&lt;br /&gt;It's all I ever want to hear&lt;br /&gt;It's music to my ears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ninety tons of thunder&lt;br /&gt;Lighting up the sky&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Steaming red hot pistons&lt;br /&gt;See the wheels flash by&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Hear the whistle blowing&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Streaking down the track&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;If I ever have my way&lt;br /&gt;I'll bring the princess back one day&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, realize that connection was made for me in the late 80s when first working at NASA and walking through the machine room complete with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-2"&gt;Cray-2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_Y-MP"&gt;Cray-YMP&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In 1989, I saw the Crays as beautiful, purposeful, behemoth "engines working hard".&amp;nbsp; Now they, especially the Cray-2, are revered but obsolete museum pieces like steam engines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until there is a NWOBHM song about machine rooms, this love song about a train will have to do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess of the Night: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7gjzZkzII"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-49noOAFsG8"&gt;regular video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: Does the pre-solo break in the song sound familiar?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt;, who were heavily influenced by the NWOBHM, would borrow it for "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seek_%26_Destroy"&gt;Seek and Destroy&lt;/a&gt;" two years later: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L62QzkgzgE"&gt;listen to this comparison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus images:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YsDTNa8fto0/UI7x76N967I/AAAAAAAAAwI/JpJnwpuTkm0/s1600/ph-balance.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YsDTNa8fto0/UI7x76N967I/AAAAAAAAAwI/JpJnwpuTkm0/s200/ph-balance.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm betting you haven't heard of the band Ph Balance; few people outside of their original Atlanta base have.&amp;nbsp; Outside of a chance viewing of one of their videos in 1999 on the "&lt;a href="http://www.independentmusicnetwork.com/"&gt;Independent Music Network&lt;/a&gt;" (I've forgotten which cable channel carried it), I would not have heard of them either.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/pH+Balance"&gt;discogs.com&lt;/a&gt; has almost nothing on them, YouTube has two songs, wikipedia has literally nothing on them, and &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/phbalanceforreal"&gt;myspace&lt;/a&gt; has an outdated page.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The summarized band history goes something like this: Pam Howe (the "Ph" in Ph Balance) and Christopher Burt have formed the basis of &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Cicada+Sings/"&gt;Cicada Sings&lt;/a&gt;, then Ph Balance, then &lt;a href="http://api.wayback.archive.org/memento/20080908083351/http://www.chakrabird.com/"&gt;Chakra Bird&lt;/a&gt;, then (and current, I believe) &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pam+Howe%E2%80%99s+Bossa+Nova+Jazz"&gt;Pam Howe's Bossa Nova Jazz&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Cicada Sings was a straightforward lounge, jazz, bossa nova band, and when they incorporated a hip-hop esthetic (complete with a few new members), they changed their name to Ph Balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes Ph Balance different from the 100s of other bands that seek to achieve the prized but elusive jazz/hip-hop integration is they do it with from a solid jazz orientation: no samples, the instruments are acoustic, and the synths are rare and limited to background use (think of them as a lounge-oriented version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roots"&gt;The Roots&lt;/a&gt;, or the acoustic, non-trip-hop version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portishead_%28band%29"&gt;Portishead&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; MC Mudfish provides the adequate rapping, but the star of the show is Pam Howe: the Gen-X, hip-hop influenced torch singer.&amp;nbsp; Not unlike &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_%28band%29"&gt;Blondie&lt;/a&gt; 20+ years earlier, while Ph Balance is technically a band the whole thing works only because of Pam.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound is very much of the time, and while not every experiment works (a few songs are worth skipping), they fail while trying to do interesting things so the misses are easily forgiven.&amp;nbsp; "Soothing" was the video I saw in 1999 (it may well be their only video), and it made such an impression on me that I had to order this LP.&amp;nbsp; Their eponymous first LP was released on tiny &lt;a href="http://www.daemonrecords.com/phbalance/index.htm"&gt;Daemon Records&lt;/a&gt; (founded by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ray"&gt;Amy Ray&lt;/a&gt;) and although I think it is out of print you can still find new copies on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ph-Balance/dp/B00000ID3N"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Songs: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIRbLAWAscs"&gt;Soothing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrLDFEvN4Gk"&gt;Flora Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, C'est Noire, Come Back to My Arms (And Stay), Whirl Twirl Toy, Speak To My Face, Hand Hurt, I Want to Shrink, (find these songs at &lt;a href="http://grooveshark.com/artist/Ph+Balance/88524"&gt;grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Songs: She Favors Winter, Kaleidoscope React, Back Off &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1048638/a/PH+Balance.htm"&gt;cduniverse&lt;/a&gt; has an informative LP review. &amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>Sirah - "Double Yellow Lines" (spotlight)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345219+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GMrBApPiwLQ/UHMHwGd4SZI/AAAAAAAAAuA/DBWRGHMzhPA/s1600/sirah-dyl-sc1-cropped.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="131" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GMrBApPiwLQ/UHMHwGd4SZI/AAAAAAAAAuA/DBWRGHMzhPA/s200/sirah-dyl-sc1-cropped.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Since the &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/10/bow-wow-wow-i-want-candy-forgotten-song.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; mentioned &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabella_Lwin"&gt;Annabella Lwin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_Wow_Wow"&gt;Bow Wow Wow,&lt;/a&gt; you might be asking "whatever happened to her?"&amp;nbsp; I can now tell you she has been reincarnated as &lt;a href="http://sirahmusic.com/"&gt;Sirah&lt;/a&gt;, the 20-something &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_ethic#Punk_culture"&gt;DIY&lt;/a&gt; punk/indie-pop/hip-hop rapper.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned about her a while back when &lt;a href="http://96.1/"&gt;96.1&lt;/a&gt; played the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skrillex"&gt;Skrillex&lt;/a&gt; song "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJVmu6yttiw"&gt;Bangarang&lt;/a&gt;", in which she is featured.&amp;nbsp; Poking around on Youtube turned up her 2011 single "Double Yellow Lines".&amp;nbsp; Since she's unsigned, her discography is not entirely clear: I think this song was supposed to appear on an EP called "Trick'd", but I can't determine if that was ever released.&amp;nbsp; You can learn more about her in various interviews: &lt;a href="http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2011/09/sirah_double_yellow_lines.php"&gt;LAWeekly&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.hercampus.com/school/binghamton/hc-exclusive-interview-female-rapper-sirah-0"&gt;Her Campus&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://mousertime.blogspot.com/2012/04/sirah-interview.html"&gt;Mousertime&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziTglMSsQK8"&gt;Vlaze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the "Double Yellow Lines" video, Sirah is clearly channelling Annabella as the mohawked coquette, albeit updated by 30 years.&amp;nbsp; Although it is probably a coincidence, the video also features a "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luncheon_on_the_Grass"&gt;Luncheon on the Grass&lt;/a&gt;", like BWW's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_Jungle!_See_Jungle!_Go_Join_Your_Gang,_Yeah._City_All_Over!_Go_Ape_Crazy."&gt;See Jungle...&lt;/a&gt;" LP.&amp;nbsp; However, instead of the "Endless Summer" beach setting of the "I Want Candy" video, DYL is set in a safe, suburban environment: how many music videos do you know that feature a bunch of kids riding around in a minivan, filling up on gas, and eating at a diner?&amp;nbsp; Danette also noted the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatty_Cathy"&gt;Chatty Cathy&lt;/a&gt;" reference in the lyrics -- not standard fare for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y"&gt;Gen Yer&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the whole thing works surprisingly well.&amp;nbsp; A youthful, light-hearted video that captures the spirit of the song, well-produced and successfully straddling a number of genres; I'm surprised this song hasn't launched a career for her (yet).&amp;nbsp; I'm not really her target demographic; I have more in common with the boring, old-enough-to-be-her-dad guy that appears at 1:14 in video (left), but the video is so fun that it makes me feel like the just-happy-to-be-here entourage guy that appears at 3:20 (right).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-veLNrG6rT4g/UHMgLTfTWVI/AAAAAAAAAvI/1UtSkzIl2K4/s1600/sirah-dyl-guys.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="140" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-veLNrG6rT4g/UHMgLTfTWVI/AAAAAAAAAvI/1UtSkzIl2K4/s320/sirah-dyl-guys.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sirah - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuBx6KiXxZ0"&gt;Double Yellow Lines&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is neither a &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/the%20song%20remains%20the%20same"&gt;cover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/forgotten%20song"&gt;forgotten song&lt;/a&gt;, nor a &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/LP%20review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of a complete release, I've started a new series, "spotlight", for songs that deserve attention but don't fit in the previously define categories.</content>

    <title>Bow Wow Wow - "I Want Candy" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345232+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fnn0LBslNNM/UHLtQBgp0mI/AAAAAAAAAtg/7PvcVEgsLlI/s1600/bowwowow-iwantcandy.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fnn0LBslNNM/UHLtQBgp0mI/AAAAAAAAAtg/7PvcVEgsLlI/s200/bowwowow-iwantcandy.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Earlier this week &lt;a href="http://feministforum.tumblr.com/post/32853979569/prince-charming-prince-charming-ridicule-is"&gt;Danette&lt;/a&gt; and I saw &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ant"&gt;Adam Ant&lt;/a&gt; at the Norva.&amp;nbsp; Danette was more of a fan of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_the_Ants"&gt;Adam and the Ants&lt;/a&gt;/Adam Ant than I ever was and Adam is looking a little worse for the wear, but it was a fun show regardless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does remind me that I've been meaning to blog about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_Wow_Wow"&gt;Bow Wow Wow&lt;/a&gt; for a while; the connection being that Bow Wow Wow was formed when band manager &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_McLaren"&gt;Malcom McLaren&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols"&gt;Sex Pistols &lt;/a&gt;fame) convinced the Ants to leave Adam and form their own band with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabella_Lwin"&gt;Annabella Lwin&lt;/a&gt; as the lead singer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was probably a bad decision since although Bow Wow Wow had some success in the UK, their biggest hit in the US was their &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Bow-Wow-Wow-I-Want-Candy/master/137702"&gt;1982 cover&lt;/a&gt; of the song "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_Candy"&gt;I Want Candy&lt;/a&gt;", released in 1965 by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strangeloves"&gt;The Strangeloves&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; "I Want Candy" is probably the most well-known example of the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Diddley#The_Bo_Diddley_beat"&gt;Bo Diddley Beat&lt;/a&gt;" (bomp, ba-bomp-bomp, bomp-bomp).&amp;nbsp; Many (most?) artists have used this beat at some point in their career (here's a &lt;a href="http://www.legacy.com/ns/news-story.aspx?t=the-bo-diddley-beat&amp;amp;id=918"&gt;good list of&amp;nbsp; examples&lt;/a&gt;) and you have to ask yourself: given the primal effectiveness of the Bo Diddley Beat, why do we even have other beats?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bow Wow Wow: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMICD3aMZpw"&gt;I Want Candy&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;The Stangeloves: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6roiwPK3Ok"&gt;I Want Candy&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Bo Diddley: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMZjAOoX6nw"&gt;Bo Diddley&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17W7496230Y"&gt;Hey, Bo Diddley&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>The Cure - "High" (forgotten song)</title>

    <title>The Beach Boys - "Good Vibrations" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345260+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OBwkUyy_2uI/UFKEHtimVfI/AAAAAAAAAq8/FKA3hUlL-WY/s1600/beach-boys-good-vibrations.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OBwkUyy_2uI/UFKEHtimVfI/AAAAAAAAAq8/FKA3hUlL-WY/s200/beach-boys-good-vibrations.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I just finished reading "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Nearest-Far-Away-Place/dp/0805047026"&gt;The Nearest Far Away Place&lt;/a&gt;", the 1996 biography of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson"&gt;Brian Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys"&gt;The Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I believe it was a thrift-store find from Terry many years ago and I've just now gotten around to reading it.&amp;nbsp; I moderately enjoyed the book, but there were several features that limited my enjoyment: 1) it was written before the 1998 death of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilson"&gt;Carl Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, 2) there was way too much biography about the Wilson's grandparents and great-grandparents, 3) many of the stories reported in the book now have contradicting stories, and 4) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_White_%28editor%29"&gt;Timothy Whites&lt;/a&gt;'s "rock-n-roll" writing style was excruciating.&amp;nbsp; Having recently read &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Spitz"&gt;Marc Spitz&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://www.davidbowiebook.com/"&gt;Bowie&lt;/a&gt;" I can only assume things have reached epidemic status and&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism"&gt;Hunter S. Thompson&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_case"&gt;patient zero&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it was fun to revisit The Beach Boys; I've been busy ripping my old CDs and I've just now gotten around to ordering (and enjoying) the apocryphal "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28The_Beach_Boys_album%29"&gt;SMiLE&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; I'm not quite ambitious enough to rehash the cultural importance of Brian Wilson, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Sounds"&gt;Pet Sounds&lt;/a&gt;", "SMiLE"/"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley_Smile"&gt;Smiley Smile&lt;/a&gt;", etc.&amp;nbsp; -- and really, what could I say that hasn't been said before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will briefly mention the 1966 single "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations"&gt;Good Vibrations&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Originally developed during the "Pet Sounds" sessions, it was left off that LP and released as an advance single for "SMiLE".&amp;nbsp; Nearly a year later "SMiLE" devolved into "Smiley Smile", and that was pretty much it for Brian Wilson.&amp;nbsp; But the fact that this song was ever a hit is nothing short of amazing.&amp;nbsp; Sure, the standard song structure is in place, but how many other hit songs that you know of feature an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro-theremin"&gt;electro-theremin&lt;/a&gt;?!&amp;nbsp; If you could pretend that you haven't heard this song 1000 times before, you realize it is amazing that you ever heard it in the first place.&amp;nbsp; Before The Beach Boys became a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-40Xixpr35I"&gt;Ronald Reagan-approved&lt;/a&gt; nostalgia act, there was the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson#Onset_of_mental_illness_and_drug_addiction"&gt;drug-induced breakdown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://blog.silentadministration.org/2011/01/beach-boys-mike-love-talks.html"&gt;TM&lt;/a&gt;, and of course &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Wilson#Charles_Manson"&gt;Charles Manson&lt;/a&gt; (no, really). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I would like to draw your attention to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_TV"&gt;Psychic TV&lt;/a&gt;'s excellent cover of "Good Vibrations", which I believe first appeared on their 1986 EP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Psychic-TV-The-Magickal-Mystery-D-Tour-EP/master/17445"&gt;Magickal Mystery D Tour&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; I'm not going to even try to explain Psychic TV / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_P-Orridge"&gt;Genesis P-Orridge&lt;/a&gt;... other than credit Terry for my first Psychic TV experience too.&amp;nbsp; Psychic TV plays the cover pretty close to the original, with only the spoken word part during the break (~2:40), but that little touch makes the cover stand out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beach Boys: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwrKKbaClME"&gt;stereo version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeD_6Y3GQc"&gt;mono version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC2gZMNkyJo"&gt;1976 live version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychic TV: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w8PiOFO1u8"&gt;7" version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pVKtq22pU"&gt;long version&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Catherine Wheel - "Ferment" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345302+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l5Lwi1On0Vo/UCgREr92MvI/AAAAAAAAApc/lkN2Pd3StKk/s1600/CatherineWheelFerment.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="199" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l5Lwi1On0Vo/UCgREr92MvI/AAAAAAAAApc/lkN2Pd3StKk/s200/CatherineWheelFerment.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You know that music that's played before and in between sets at concerts?&amp;nbsp; Presumably it is the sound engineer's cousin's band, with music that is simultaneously slightly familiar (if only because it is so derivative) but ultimately forgettable.&amp;nbsp; It blandly fills the aural space without distracting from the live acts that will follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got that sound in your mind?&amp;nbsp; That's what "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferment_%28album%29"&gt;Ferment&lt;/a&gt;", the 1992 LP by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Wheel"&gt;Catherine Wheel&lt;/a&gt; sounds like.&amp;nbsp; None of the songs on this LP are really bad, some are decent (e.g., "Indigo is Blue"), but it's mostly an uninspiring shoegaze-by-numbers.&amp;nbsp; A reminder: I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegazing"&gt;shoegazing&lt;/a&gt;, but CW is no &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_%28band%29"&gt;MBV&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowdive"&gt;Slowdive&lt;/a&gt;; they're not even &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_%28band%29"&gt;Curve&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lush_%28band%29"&gt;Lush&lt;/a&gt; -- a point apparently lost on &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/ferment-mw0000079412"&gt;Allmusic's Andy Kellman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uninspiring except for, and this is a huge "except", the song "Black Metallic".&amp;nbsp; Catherine Wheel caught lightning in a bottle for this one epic song.&amp;nbsp; I don't recall this song getting radio airplay, and although they have a video for the single edit (i.e., 4 minute version), I don't remember the video either.&amp;nbsp; But you really need to hear the 7 minute LP version; the single version doesn't build the same energy.&amp;nbsp; And it goes without saying that you also need maximum volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not entirely sure what the song is about: &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/55475/"&gt;some explanations&lt;/a&gt; include being in love with an emotionally unavailable person ("I never see you when you're smiling") or even an automobile ("Your skin is black metallic").&amp;nbsp; Those are pretty boring explanations; I read in some forgotten page a long time ago that it was about sex with a robot.&amp;nbsp; Granted, that's almost surely not true, but it &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to be true because it lends an engaging &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Blade_Runner_characters#Rachael"&gt;sci-fi creepiness&lt;/a&gt; to the song ("I think of you when you're sleeping / And all the secrets that you're keeping"). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "Black Metallic" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcrj-FFK4MM"&gt;7 minute LP version&lt;/a&gt;), (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wiLo2TM6fk"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;), (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtTqR9oZX6Q"&gt;4 minute single version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Songs that appear: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TyJ3yF140A"&gt;Indigo Is Blue&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXGTNtktE4s"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 5/10.&amp;nbsp; I don't normally recommend skipping the entire LP in favor of a single, but this is one of those times.</content>

    <title>Velocity Girl - "Velocity Girl" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345316+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ycRM7V1YY1Y/UCcXEzP0swI/AAAAAAAAApA/6bT5RxCu4lk/s1600/velocity-girl-6-songs.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ycRM7V1YY1Y/UCcXEzP0swI/AAAAAAAAApA/6bT5RxCu4lk/s200/velocity-girl-6-songs.jpg" width="198" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_Girl_%28album%29"&gt;Velocity Girl&lt;/a&gt;", later unimaginatively reissued as "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Velocity-Girl-6-Song-Compilation/master/310559"&gt;6 Song Compilation&lt;/a&gt;", is an EP by the late 80s - mid 90s band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_Girl"&gt;Velocity Girl&lt;/a&gt;. Although they were based in Maryland, I didn't know about Velocity Girl until they received minor radio airplay with their 1994 single "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaMrivLS8bU"&gt;Sorry Again&lt;/a&gt;", a song I simply don't tire of.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately they were a one hit wonder: they released three solid, but ultimately unspectacular LPs on &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Sub+Pop"&gt;Sub Pop&lt;/a&gt; before hanging it up in 1996.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 1993 EP collects their early singles released on &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Slumberland+Records"&gt;Slumberland Records&lt;/a&gt; before they joined Sub Pop.&amp;nbsp; It captures their early sound, including three songs with their first lead singer, &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Bridget+Cross"&gt;Bridget Cross&lt;/a&gt;, who was replaced by &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sarah+Shannon"&gt;Sarah Shannon&lt;/a&gt; in 1990.&amp;nbsp; It includes the 1990 single "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Velocity-Girl-I-Dont-Care-If-You-Go/release/1453071"&gt;I Don't Care If You Go&lt;/a&gt;", the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Velocity-Girl-I-Dont-Care-If-You-Go/release/1607055"&gt;Australian version&lt;/a&gt; of that same single (with different B-sides), and the 1992 single "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Velocity-Girl-My-Forgotten-Favorite/release/898294"&gt;My Forgotten Favorite&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this EP enjoyable is that even though I did not know of them prior to 1993, the band's sound is very much of the time and as such makes a pleasant time capsule for early 90s college rock (see also: &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/The%20Connells"&gt;The Connells&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; I'm not claiming this is a retroactively vital lost classic, but if you haven't heard of Velocity Girl then think of it as "new" music from twenty years ago.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAssFnliOww"&gt;I Don't Care If You Go&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urUTiRLmnYc"&gt;Always&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btzBkgL7UTk"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JSNfoNkaPI"&gt;My Forgotten Favorite&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4n6vG2gzTI"&gt;Why Should I Be Nice To You&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZzX9xHabPU"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 6/10&amp;nbsp; Fun, but not necessary.&amp;nbsp; Want the full time capsule effect?&amp;nbsp; Check out the live concert footage links above. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Yngwie Malmsteen - "Rising Force" (LP Review)</title>

Peninsula Atari Computer Enthusiasts (PACE) meeting at NASA Langley with my father, he drove me to the Tracks in Norfolk.&amp;nbsp; You have to remember that growing up in Denbigh in 1985, Norfolk seemed (to me anyway) like the other end of the world.&amp;nbsp; I don't remember who brought up going there -- I might have asked, but I don't recall.&amp;nbsp; And I think there may have been another father/son pair with us, but I'm not clear on that either.&amp;nbsp; But I do recall that at the time, Tracks had a dedicated "metal" section, with all the imports and other hard-to-find LPs that other stores would not carry.&amp;nbsp; It was on that trip that I bought &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngwie_Malmsteen"&gt;Yngwie Malmsteen&lt;/a&gt;'s 1984 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Force"&gt;Rising Force&lt;/a&gt;" as a gift for my HS (and later, college) girlfriend.&amp;nbsp; She had told me about him but did not have the LP (remember that the "local" stores did not carry it).&amp;nbsp; Also, at ~$20 it represented quite an investment for me at the time -- remember when music cost big $? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LP itself?&amp;nbsp; It is hard to overstate the importance that it had on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shred_guitar"&gt;shredding&lt;/a&gt;, arguably defining it as a stand-alone genre.&amp;nbsp; Sure, there had been "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI7XiJgt0vY"&gt;Eruption&lt;/a&gt;" and other amazing tracks on various LPs, but I believe Yngwie was the first to release a popular, metal LP focused only on guitar.&amp;nbsp; There are two vocal tracks which are best skipped, but the other six tracks form the nucleus of what every other LP in this genre wishes it could be (including later LPs by Yngwie, which were never in the same class as "Rising Force").&amp;nbsp; Yngwie wasn't the first guitarist to shred, but he arguably released the first shred LP.&amp;nbsp; (Context: recall that at this time &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Van_Halen"&gt;Eddie Van Halen&lt;/a&gt; had all but abdicated his throne with the release of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_%28Van_Halen_album%29"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;" and his pointless fascination with keyboards.&amp;nbsp; Who thought that was a good idea?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yngwie was the first to really popularize metal as a modern extension of classical music, explicitly namechecking artists like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach"&gt;JS Bach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Paganini"&gt;Paganini&lt;/a&gt;, as well as using actual harpsichords (not synths) in the songs.&amp;nbsp; Of course I thought that was beyond cool at the time.&amp;nbsp; Metal always had the culture of the virtuoso, but Yngwie took it to another level.&amp;nbsp; Yes, this was dangerously close to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera"&gt;Metal Opera&lt;/a&gt;, but the mostly instrumental focus of the LP helps curb its worst tendencies.&amp;nbsp; Prior to "Rising Force", Yngwie had released some forgettable LPs as the guitarist for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeler"&gt;Steeler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatrazz"&gt;Alcatrazz&lt;/a&gt;, on which he had only brief moments to shine (e.g., Steeler's "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGzLLpa5XoE"&gt;Hot on Your Heels&lt;/a&gt;" intro, which was also used in the radio program "&lt;a href="http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/old-school/154686-metalshop-radio-show.html"&gt;Metal Shop&lt;/a&gt;" -- remember that?), but this is the LP where he blossomed as a solo artist.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably still have a tape of the LP in question some where in my stuff,  but in an interesting bit of symmetry I also have the CD: I acquired it  from Danette, in a box of CDs from a friend of her's that was purging  his CD collection after ripping them.&amp;nbsp; So while the Ward's Corner area has been in decline for quite some time and the &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2012/07/neighborhood-rediscovering-its-pride"&gt;planned renovation is welcome&lt;/a&gt;, it is with a nostalgic fondness that I recall Tracks, that night with my father, and my excitement at selecting a perfect gift.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNQZc84Q5c"&gt;Black Star&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QbNuctX4TI"&gt;Evil Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaRDxgToDHw"&gt;Little Savage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsHFSrh0i8"&gt;Far Beyond the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtUn_QHtZGc"&gt;Icarus' Dream Suite Opus 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z21h-VuIFpg"&gt;Farewell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE_i-AIQZto"&gt;Now Your Ships Are Burned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVUxdNHrnBU"&gt;As Above, So Below&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10.&amp;nbsp; The LP is hugely influential, but replacing the two vocal songs with something as good as "Black Star" would have made for a perfect LP.</content>

    <title>Deep Purple - "Child In Time" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345344+00:00</updated>

    <title>The Caretaker - "An Empty Bliss Beyond This World" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345358+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LaCP8phjNsE/UAGMsx_icnI/AAAAAAAAAns/-DPScVw7u_Q/s1600/caretaker-empty-bliss.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LaCP8phjNsE/UAGMsx_icnI/AAAAAAAAAns/-DPScVw7u_Q/s200/caretaker-empty-bliss.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A few months ago I purchased the most recent (at the time) LP by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caretaker_%28musician%29"&gt;The Caretaker&lt;/a&gt;, 2011's "&lt;a href="http://brainwashed.com/vvm/releases/the_caretaker_an_empty_bliss_beyond_this_world.html"&gt;An Empty Bliss Beyond This World&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; A couple of years ago I reviewed his 2008 LP "&lt;a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/vvm/releases/the_caretaker_persistent_repetition_of_phrases.html"&gt;Persistent Repetition of Phrases&lt;/a&gt;" and I was completely blown away by The Caretaker's entire aesthetic of reprocessed collective nostalgia.&amp;nbsp; I won't repeat myself here -- read &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/11/caretaker-persistent-repetition-of.html"&gt;my review of PROP&lt;/a&gt; for the necessary context of this work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first listen, AEBBTW is very similar to PROP: if you like one, you'll certainly like the other.&amp;nbsp; But there are subtle differences that are only apparent on careful listening.&amp;nbsp; PROP (metaphorically) broadly explored the notion of memory and aging (e.g., with song titles like "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Restorff_effect"&gt;Von Restorff Effect&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacunar_amnesia"&gt;Lacunar Amnesia&lt;/a&gt;"), while AEBBTW focuses specifically on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; While the songs draw from the same source material, here they are less processed than the songs on PROP; there is less of a hazy, dream-like quality to them.&amp;nbsp; There is more looping, frequent abrupt termination to the songs, and a generally less linear feel to the songs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting note is that James Kirby (aka The Caretaker) has retired his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V/Vm_Test_Records"&gt;V/Vm Test Records&lt;/a&gt; label and is instead releasing on his newly established label &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/History+Always+Favours+The+Winners"&gt;History Always Favours The Winners&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp; I also recommend the reviews at &lt;a href="http://alteredzones.com/posts/1492/zoned-caretaker-empty-bliss-beyond-world/"&gt;Altered Zones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/"&gt;pitchfork.com&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which does a good job comparing this LP to other artists with which I'm unfamiliar.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: Picking out individual songs is difficult, but if forced to do so I'd say be sure to listen to "Libet's Delay" and "Camaraderie At Arms Length".&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure how they'd sound out of context, so fortunately &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/alteredzones"&gt;Altered Zones&lt;/a&gt; has uploaded the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL998ajnjN4"&gt;entire LP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10.&amp;nbsp; While this is an impressive LP, I have a preference for the ghost-like quality of "Persistent Repetition of Phrases".</content>

    <title>Husker Du - "Land Speed Record" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345371+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uS2_unA-HyU/T_9FGIKLszI/AAAAAAAAAng/kFVW22y82Ns/s1600/husker-du-land-speed-record.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="199" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uS2_unA-HyU/T_9FGIKLszI/AAAAAAAAAng/kFVW22y82Ns/s200/husker-du-land-speed-record.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;17 songs in less than 27 minutes.&amp;nbsp; A live, 2-track recording from 1981.&amp;nbsp; A recording budget ($350) only slightly larger than the capacity of the venue (250 people) where it was recorded.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/New+Alliance+Records"&gt;seventh release on an independent label&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Song titles like "Guns At My School" and "Tired of Doing Things".&amp;nbsp; A vaguely political statement for the cover art.&amp;nbsp; If you don't already know what this sounds like, you haven't been paying attention.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Released in early 1982, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Speed_Record_%28album%29"&gt;Land Speed Record&lt;/a&gt;" is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt;'s first LP, and that alone makes it of interest especially since only two of these songs would later be recorded in the studio ("Bricklayer" and "Let's Go Die").&amp;nbsp; But let's be honest: while the songs are ferocious, the poor recording quality makes them nearly unlistenable.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure it was a great show to be at, but this is the kind of recording that people claim to love so they can be "&lt;a href="http://theyoungones.wikia.com/wiki/Vyvyan_Basterd"&gt;very metal&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the SST posthumously re-released 1988 CD version (the band broke up in 1987), which SST did not bother to even segment into separate tracks: just part one and part two.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Husker%20Du"&gt;I love Husker Du&lt;/a&gt; and I'm glad I have this CD, but it honestly looks better on the shelf than it sounds coming through the speakers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Songs: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw2jJw17dkw"&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nZZVpD3qsU"&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 5/10. &amp;nbsp; If you want to explore their early catalog (i.e., pre-"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Arcade"&gt;Zen Arcade&lt;/a&gt;"), it is better to stick with "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/08/husker-du-everything-falls-apart-and.html"&gt;Everything Falls Apart&lt;/a&gt;" or "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Circus"&gt;Metal Circus&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

    <title>Black Sabbath - "Born Again" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345385+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qqqQE5x77L4/T_haSgPRH5I/AAAAAAAAAnI/NKC0HZb8Gf8/s1600/black-sabbath-born-again.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Again_%28Black_Sabbath_album%29#Release.2C_reception_and_influence"&gt;Contemporary reviews&lt;/a&gt; panned the LP ("one of heavy metal's all-time greatest disappointments").&amp;nbsp; Few liked the production ("in a misguided attempt to record the heaviest album ever, [they] came away with the muddiest instead"), and nobody liked the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Again_%28Black_Sabbath_album%29#Album_cover"&gt;cover art&lt;/a&gt;, including the person that created it (&lt;a href="http://www.black-sabbath.com/2004/06/depeche_mode/"&gt;black-sabbath.com&lt;/a&gt; has a nice article with quotes from the artist explaining the cover's origin).&amp;nbsp; The supporting tour was a comedy of errors (more on that later).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late 1982, Black Sabbath was looking to replace its vocalist for the 3rd time in as many years.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_James_Dio"&gt;Ronnie James Dio&lt;/a&gt; had joined the band in 1980, replacing the venerable &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne"&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;, but had left in 1982 in a bitter dispute with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi"&gt;Tony Iommi&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The replacement was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Gillan"&gt;Ian Gillan&lt;/a&gt;, who had been quite successful fronting &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Purple"&gt;Deep Purple&lt;/a&gt; during their height of popularity.&amp;nbsp; So you have a set of veterans trying to recapture the magic of 10+ years ago, especially in light of their style of music about to be supplanted by the emerging sub-genre of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal#Mid-1980s"&gt;thrash metal&lt;/a&gt; (remember: "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_%27Em_All"&gt;Kill 'Em All&lt;/a&gt;" also came out in 1983).&amp;nbsp; Add to this mix a family feud (Ozzy &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Osbourne"&gt;Sharon Arden&lt;/a&gt; vs. Black Sabbath &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Arden"&gt;Don Arden&lt;/a&gt; (Sabbath's manager and Sharon's father)), and the result is simply a band trying really, really hard -- perhaps too hard -- to be the heaviest thing out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's where I stand: this is actually a pretty good LP.&amp;nbsp; Not a great LP, mind you.&amp;nbsp; But a good one nonetheless, even if it doesn't hold up to the classic Ozzy-led Sabbath LPs, or even the two Dio LPs.&amp;nbsp; It is leagues ahead of the last two Ozzy Sabbath LPs (remember "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Ecstasy"&gt;Technical Ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Say_Die%21"&gt;Never Say Die&lt;/a&gt;"?&amp;nbsp; I didn't think so).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;cover art: I agree with bassist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geezer_Butler"&gt;Geezer Butler&lt;/a&gt;, who said of the cover: "It’s shit. but it’s fucking great!"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;production: Geezer's quote applies here too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ian Gillan: I love Deep Purple, I love Black Sabbath, and I have no problems with Purple Sabbath (full disclosure: I also kinda liked &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Hughes"&gt;Glenn Hughes&lt;/a&gt; on "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Star"&gt;Seventh Star&lt;/a&gt;", even though that barely qualified as Black Sabbath).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;But I'm here to tell you that even if you have never heard of this LP, you should &lt;i&gt;celebrate its very existence&lt;/i&gt; for one reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;It is the cornerstone of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Spinal_Tap"&gt;This Is Spinal Tap&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ok, sure, there are plenty of rock/metal cliches for Spinal Tap to mine, and maybe Spinal Tap would have existed without this LP, but it would not have been as funny.&amp;nbsp; Here, in increasing order of priority, here are the contributions of "Born Again" to Spinal Tap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;production that no one likes: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sz5OrACPn8"&gt;You don't, you don't do heavy metal in doubly, you know&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cover art that no one likes: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx6fwfBKCIQ"&gt;I think we're stuck with a very stupid and dismal-looking album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="st"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;most importantly: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zdyo4vJuCU"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Yes, the "Born Again" tour gave us Stonehenge.&amp;nbsp; And not just Stonehenge mind you, but Stonehenge with a dwarf, because who doesn't look at the 20+ feet-high trilithons and think "you know what's missing?&amp;nbsp; a dwarf."&amp;nbsp; In real life, the Sabbath Stonehenge set was actually too big (because of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Again_Tour_1983#Staging"&gt;feet vs. meters confusion&lt;/a&gt;) to fit in most venues instead of too small ("I think that the problem *may* have been, that there was a Stonehenge  monument on the stage that was in danger of being *crushed* by a  *dwarf*. Alright?"). Here's a short reflection from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppR838nSNX8"&gt;Ian Gillan about Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.spinaltapfan.com/articles/stonehenge.html"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is an enjoyable, but not classic, LP.&amp;nbsp; And in retrospect, it was Sabbath's last commercially or critically significant studio LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCCCzi8z0zM"&gt;Trashed&lt;/a&gt;" (there just aren't enough songs celebrating drunk driving...), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Nfj8wk-0Y"&gt;Disturbing The Priest&lt;/a&gt;" (and even rarer: songs inspired about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disturbing_the_Priest"&gt;interrupting choir practice&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqEo-gg7mE8"&gt;Zero The Hero&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uZ_w0IcepY"&gt;Digital Bitch&lt;/a&gt;" (and the rarest rock genre of all: songs trashing Ozzy's wife), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpWrqDHLKoA"&gt;Born Again&lt;/a&gt;" (Iommi's guitar sound on this is great), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwDwWtU13ok"&gt;Keep It Warm&lt;/a&gt;" (well-suited for Gillan's style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip' em songs:&amp;nbsp; none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 6/10.&amp;nbsp; Stonehenge, people, it gave us Stonehenge: "Where the dew drops cry and the cats meow".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links #1: official videos -- caution: they're really awful and will make you enjoy the songs less:&amp;nbsp; "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz44xS5MzYE"&gt;Trashed&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwoT9_StEfY"&gt;Zero The Hero&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links #2: bootlegs of unmixed demos are floating around the web (&lt;a href="http://illogicalcontraption.blogspot.com/2012/05/purple-sabbath-black-sabbath-born-again.html"&gt;illogical contraption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://vivalesbootlegs.blogspot.com/2009/03/black-sabbath-born-again-unmixed-demos.html"&gt;viva les bootlegs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus image:&amp;nbsp; The magazine image that became the cover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O6QcGWrzY1M/T_hr5Wwf9bI/AAAAAAAAAnU/lXujfBK_TIE/s1600/black-sabbath-born-again-mind-alive.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O6QcGWrzY1M/T_hr5Wwf9bI/AAAAAAAAAnU/lXujfBK_TIE/s320/black-sabbath-born-again-mind-alive.jpg" width="234" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Bonus link: The Guardian has an article that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/sep/22/film.film"&gt;points out problems&lt;/a&gt; with the timing of Black Sabbath influencing "This Is Spinal Tap": the band's tour and the movie both occurred in 1984.&amp;nbsp; But that would mean that life imitated art, down to dwarfs and dimensionally inappropriate Stonehenges, and that is just too terrible to contemplate.&amp;nbsp; I'm sticking with my more comforting ordering of events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Bad Bonus links #2: Turns out, the Stonehenge bit was in the original, 1982 20 minute demo version of the movie, entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439825/"&gt;Spinal Tap: The Final Tour&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHdVhEN_pBQ#t=3m48s"&gt;direct link to the scene&lt;/a&gt;, and here is the full demo (parts &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGfZOpzfxFM"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHdVhEN_pBQ"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Sabbath would not have known about the 20 minute demo film in 1983/84, so I guess this is like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy"&gt;Newton and Leibniz&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The Magnetic Fields - "Distortion" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345399+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hjJEPYXTxI4/T_H8XaPb_6I/AAAAAAAAAm8/ZBmU1yWmXGQ/s1600/magnetic-fields-distortion.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="180" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hjJEPYXTxI4/T_H8XaPb_6I/AAAAAAAAAm8/ZBmU1yWmXGQ/s200/magnetic-fields-distortion.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnetic_Fields"&gt;The Magnetic Fields&lt;/a&gt; pay homage to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain"&gt;The Jesus and Mary Chain&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If your reaction to that statement is "who and who?!", then you're not going to appreciate this LP.&amp;nbsp; "Distortion" is the 2008 TMF LP that borrows heavily from the aural aesthetic of TJAMJ's 1985 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pop"&gt;noisy&lt;/a&gt; masterpiece "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychocandy"&gt;Psychocandy&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In itself, that's not such a big deal -- lots of bands wish they could make something as good as "Psychocandy".&amp;nbsp; When TMF does it, it is a big deal.&amp;nbsp; Not only is their sound more in a synth &amp;amp; folk pop sound, TMF's leader &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephin_Merritt"&gt;Stephin Merritt&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis"&gt;hyperacusis&lt;/a&gt;, which explains in part why TMF has typically has a muted and restrained sound (and why the live performances of these songs are not done in the typical TMF style and&amp;nbsp; TJAMC style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a fun LP -- every band should do a Psychocandy homage -- but the song writing does not approach the genius of something like "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/06/magnetic-fields-69-love-songs-lp-review.html"&gt;69 Love Songs&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; There are no bad songs and some are quite good, but the production is a bit of a gimmick.&amp;nbsp; Granted it is a gimmick I like, but this should not be your first TMF LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ssjAgWNOts"&gt;Threeway&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUWripFBrII"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2EQxrGU7Yc"&gt;California Girls&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryt1PY8R1-s"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy16Bzq42zA"&gt;Please Stop Dancing&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b19ej7pDoN8"&gt;Too Drunk To Dream&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZUmDg1jjQ"&gt;I'll Dream Alone&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OA3ozYhgFs"&gt;The Nun's Litany&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 7/10.&amp;nbsp; Essential only for TMF and/or TJAMC fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EgB__YratE"&gt;Just Like Honey&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwhdABqliOw"&gt;Taste of Cindy&lt;/a&gt;".</content>

    <title>The Magnetic Fields - "69 Love Songs" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345414+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vMcXrt0yymI/T-Uqy9hAxOI/AAAAAAAAAmw/QR_0jaIl_9c/s1600/magnetic-fields-69-love-songs.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="179" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vMcXrt0yymI/T-Uqy9hAxOI/AAAAAAAAAmw/QR_0jaIl_9c/s200/magnetic-fields-69-love-songs.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;It has taken me a while to get my head around just how remarkable "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_Love_Songs"&gt;69 Love Songs&lt;/a&gt;"  is, but the iTunes play count doesn't lie.&amp;nbsp; I've wanted to review it  for a while but I've been intimidated by its scale.&amp;nbsp; Released in 1999,  "69 Love Songs" is a triple LP from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;-indie-rockers &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnetic_Fields"&gt;The Magnetic Fields&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure "NPR-indie-rockers" is a legitimate music genre, but think of it is as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rock"&gt;80s college radio&lt;/a&gt; all grown up with kids and a mortgage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"69  Love Songs" is, at first blush, a relatively simple concept LP:  literally 69 songs about love.&amp;nbsp; No big deal, right? -- most songs you  hear every day are about love in one way or another.&amp;nbsp; But this isn't  really 69 songs celebrating love, this is 69 songs celebrating &lt;i&gt;love songs&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;  A love song to love songs, if you will. &amp;nbsp; In fact, the entire LP can be  summarized with these lines from the song "The Book of Love":&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;The book of love has music in it&lt;br /&gt;In fact, that's where music comes from&lt;br /&gt;Some of it is just transcendental&lt;br /&gt;Some of it is just really dumb &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Although TMF is a band with a relatively stable lineup, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephin_Merritt"&gt;Stephin Merritt&lt;/a&gt; is the unquestioned leader, primary lead singer,&amp;nbsp; and sole songwriter  for TMF.&amp;nbsp; This LP is his "book of love", covering the entire spectrum  from "transcendental" to "really dumb".&amp;nbsp; Every imaginable aspect of  romantic love is covered (gay, straight, unrequited, celebration,  prurient, mature, etc.), along with a full range of musical styles  (Celtic, world, folk, country, punk, jazz, electronic, surf rock, and  surely other sub-genres that I'm forgetting).&amp;nbsp; Doing a cross product of  "types of love" and "types of music" is&lt;/span&gt; how you get to a triple  LP with 69 songs.&amp;nbsp; When you begin to appreciate the ambition and scale  of the project, you wonder how he can fit it in &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; 69 songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Ok,  so Merritt wrote a lot of love songs... what makes this collection work  is that Merritt is a wickedly clever lyricist and songwriter (I will  not spoil the several laugh-out-loud gems sprinkled throughout the  LPs).&amp;nbsp; This simple concept would not work in the hands of someone less  expert, in which case the songs would be closer to parody than  celebration.&amp;nbsp; Some reviews (e.g., &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090123151925/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/a-brilliant-head-rules-the-heart-710139.html"&gt;The Independent, July 2000&lt;/a&gt;)  considered the question of the "authenticity" of Merritt covering far  more experiences than any one lifetime could support, but that  presupposes that personal experience is the only source for songs.&amp;nbsp; But  if you accept this is a celebration of love songs, then I suppose that  is actually what has happened and why this LP resonates so strongly:  we've all heard these kinds of songs and from transcendental to really  dumb, they are the stuff of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;I'm  going to deviate from the normal LP Review structure.&amp;nbsp; There are no bad  songs on this LP, and there are too many great songs to cover.&amp;nbsp; I'm  going to choose an arbitrary limit of four songs from each of the three  volumes, but don't read too much into this list because I'm sure it  would vary each time I rewrote it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Volume 1:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8vW_0H_Kg"&gt;All My Little Words&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5eBxU248Y"&gt;I Don't Want To Get Over You&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhO1XlDFqxE"&gt;The Luckiest Guy On The Lower East Side&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox6aHGmfxB8"&gt;The Book Of Love&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Volume 2:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTHoM9uD6nc"&gt;(Crazy For You But) Not That Crazy&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYLLNhTiQZc"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yZ50ptDpuQ"&gt;Papa Was A Rodeo&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlsfhefVQpo"&gt;I Shatter&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Volume 3:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/854633"&gt;I'm Sorry I Love You&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pO__gg5kcA"&gt;Acoustic Guitar&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uwvLuvTXZ4"&gt;Yeah! Oh, Yeah!&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6D_DTctge4"&gt;The Night You Can't Remember&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;By my count, 11/12 of the videos linked above are from aspiring video directors, art students, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidding"&gt;fan boys&lt;/a&gt;,  and just one is the song uploaded with a static image.&amp;nbsp; I think that  says something about 1) the inspirational quality of the music, and 2)  the kinds of people it inspires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Final Score: 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Mazzy Star - "Common Burn/Lay Myself Down" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345428+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TqffFyYPAJI/T9-f4LvhAGI/AAAAAAAAAmk/Tsr1y4Rze_k/s1600/mazzy-star-common-burn.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TqffFyYPAJI/T9-f4LvhAGI/AAAAAAAAAmk/Tsr1y4Rze_k/s200/mazzy-star-common-burn.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Yeah, I know &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazzy_Star"&gt;Mazzy Star&lt;/a&gt; never officially broke up and they were just on indefinite hiatus, but I was still surprised to find this new single from them.&amp;nbsp; "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Burn/Lay_Myself_Down"&gt;Common Burn/Lay Myself Down&lt;/a&gt;" was released in late 2011 and is the advance single from their still untitled and unreleased 2012 LP.&amp;nbsp; Since it was 1996 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_My_Swan"&gt;the last time they released an LP&lt;/a&gt;, I guess we can wait 8+ months after the first single is released to find out the title of their new LP.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In what is becoming de rigueur for hip bands, here are two ways to get this single: &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Mazzy-Star-Lay-Myself-Down/release/3346864"&gt;digital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Mazzy-Star-Common-Burn/release/3379796"&gt;7" vinyl&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I went the iTunes route, in part because I know if I start collecting 7" vinyl I won't be able to stop.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, it still doesn't feel real if I don't have a CD to file on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The song themselves...&amp;nbsp; honestly, and I mean this in the best possible way, I can't tell if these are new songs or outtakes from the 1990s.&amp;nbsp; They represent the two main types of songs from the Mazzy Star oeuvre: "Common Burn" is hazy, quiet &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegazing"&gt;shoegazing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_pop"&gt;dream pop&lt;/a&gt;, similar to "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSxJp3dE0HY"&gt;Blue Light&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxcBAktHx94"&gt;Rhymes of an Hour&lt;/a&gt;", or "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrbgcpFUWN0"&gt;Mary of Silence&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; It sounds like the cover art set to music.&amp;nbsp; The B-side, "Lay Myself Down", is a more up-beat, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_country"&gt;alt-country&lt;/a&gt; song, not unlike "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i99gRLIO6O8"&gt;I'm Sailin'&lt;/a&gt;" or "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTVm61sn06U"&gt;Give You My Lovin&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; They sound like Mazzy Star; they sound like the 1990s never ended.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ayH09psxc"&gt;Common Ground&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AseB_I7At1g"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB4tjppaVXE"&gt;Lay Myself Down&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12661-lay-myself-down/"&gt;pitchfork.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 8/10.&amp;nbsp; Neither song is "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw5VrD_d3fE"&gt;Hallah&lt;/a&gt;" nor "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8QOaaoiT9U"&gt;Fade Into You&lt;/a&gt;", but who cares?&amp;nbsp; It's new Mazzy Star and they (still) sound great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013-08-20 edit: The name of their forthcoming LP is "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasons_of_Your_Day"&gt;Seasons of Your Day&lt;/a&gt;".</content>

    <title>DJ Shadow &amp; Cut Chemist - "Product Placement" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345442+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fQts71QdpzM/T8fhYJqypNI/AAAAAAAAAmY/5_xDK38rRdY/s1600/product-placement.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fQts71QdpzM/T8fhYJqypNI/AAAAAAAAAmY/5_xDK38rRdY/s200/product-placement.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Placement_%28album%29"&gt;Product Placement&lt;/a&gt;" is the 2001 mix LP from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow"&gt;DJ Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_Chemist"&gt;Cut Chemist&lt;/a&gt; and follows their similar 1999 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfreeze_%28album%29"&gt;Brainfreeze&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; The premise of the LPs is rather simple: create a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_mix"&gt;DJ mix&lt;/a&gt; LP using nothing but &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"&gt;7" 45 rpm records&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The trick is in their expert choice, mix, and execution.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, you could do all this digitally, but that's not the point: it's just two of the premier &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turntablism"&gt;turntablists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shred_guitar"&gt;shredding&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; And limiting themselves to only material that appears on 7" steers things to an older, funk-oriented mix as well as being an homage to an obsolete format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another observation is that the presence of Cut Chemist adds a level of humor that DJ Shadow's mixes (not to mention his original material) simply don't have.&amp;nbsp; For example, listening to DJ Shadow's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/04/dj-shadow-funky-skunk-lp-review.html"&gt;Funky Skunk&lt;/a&gt;" is an entirely different experience, not to mention his early &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/DJ-Shadow-The-4-Track-Era-Collection-1990-1992/release/1786536"&gt;KMEL mixes&lt;/a&gt; or "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/DJ-Shadow-Diminishing-Returns/release/1751438"&gt;Diminishing Returns&lt;/a&gt;". They also have this fascination with 7-11 and related cultural artifacts (continued from "Brainfreeze") that would make &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Smith"&gt;Kevin Smith&lt;/a&gt; proud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, it's difficult to review a mix LP since there are only two tracks, each nearly 30 minutes long.&amp;nbsp; My two favorite parts appear in track 1:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the transition from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timmy_Thomas"&gt;Timmy Thomas&lt;/a&gt; - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS_rkCjVlBQ"&gt;Sexy Woman&lt;/a&gt;" --&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool_%26_the_Gang"&gt;Kool &amp;amp; the Gang&lt;/a&gt; - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D4BID4QvzY"&gt;N.T.&lt;/a&gt;" --&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Scott"&gt;Freddie Scott&lt;/a&gt; - "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/12/freddie-scott-you-got-what-i-need-song.html"&gt;(You) Got What I Need&lt;/a&gt;" --&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_%26_Bobby_Purify"&gt;James &amp;amp; Bobby Purify&lt;/a&gt; - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcD2iexGqZQ"&gt;I'm Your Puppet&lt;/a&gt;" (starts at ~ &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoXLqWCq1lg#t=6m50s"&gt;6:50&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the deliciously awful "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=751hUX_q0Do"&gt;Rappin' With Gas&lt;/a&gt;" (starts at ~ &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoXLqWCq1lg#t=11m26s"&gt;11:26&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Placement_%28album%29#Track_listing"&gt;full track list&lt;/a&gt; is available, but it is easier to just listen to the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoXLqWCq1lg"&gt;whole thing&lt;/a&gt; and find your own favorite parts.&amp;nbsp; In 2003 they released a &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0820861/"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; of them performing this mix live; you can find the entire thing on &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2423656910305210819"&gt;Google Video&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You owe it to yourself to check that out; obviously a big part of the appeal is watching them working together and manipulating the vinyl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10&amp;nbsp; Part of that score is based on the novelty, but this really is a fun mix LP.</content>

    <title>DJ Shadow - "Preemptive Strike" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345456+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AIWBLQpZLq8/T5RKmEw2-II/AAAAAAAAAmM/XB-A2N8Dk0c/s1600/dj-shadow-preemptive-strike.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AIWBLQpZLq8/T5RKmEw2-II/AAAAAAAAAmM/XB-A2N8Dk0c/s200/dj-shadow-preemptive-strike.jpeg" width="199" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Today's review is about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part%E2%80%93whole_theory"&gt;part vs. whole&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow"&gt;DJ Shadow&lt;/a&gt;'s 1998 compilation LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemptive_Strike_%28album%29"&gt;Preemptive Strike&lt;/a&gt;" contains in its entirety the 1994 4-track single "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/05/dj-shadow-what-does-your-soul-look-like.html"&gt;What Does Your Soul Look Like&lt;/a&gt;", which I rated as 10/10.&amp;nbsp; So if "Preemptive Strike" contains all of that release, how could it possibly be less than 10/10?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer lies in the purpose of the compilation LP and whether or not it achieved its purpose.&amp;nbsp; In 1998, DJ Shadow was leaving &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo%27Wax"&gt;Mo' Wax Records&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Corporation_of_America"&gt;MCA&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to re-release some of his earlier singles in a package that he could control (hence the name "Preemptive Strike").&amp;nbsp; Mo' Wax has a culture of releasing a lot of singles, EPs, and compilations with a limited number of pressings (often with high-quality packaging), so prior to his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endtroducing....."&gt;1996 debut LP&lt;/a&gt; he had already released at least an LP's worth of material appearing in a variety of formats, most of which are long out of print. For Mo' Wax, the vinyl or CD and its packaging are an integral part of experiencing the music, and the exclusivity of limited releases reinforces this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To assemble this LP, he chose:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The A and B sides of first full single, 1993's &lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-groove-robbers-influx-bw-hindsight"&gt;"In/flux" / "Hindsight"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All four tracks from 1995's "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/what-does-your-soul-look"&gt;What Does You Soul Look Like&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two of the four tracks from 1997's "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-high-noon"&gt;High Noon&lt;/a&gt;" ("High Noon" and "Organ Donor (Extended Overhaul)"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three short, disposable snippets of studio chatter named "Strike 1", "Strike 2", an "Strike 3"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The first problem is that 3 of these tracks, (parts 1 and 4 of "What Does Your Soul Look Like" and "Organ Donor") appeared, albeit in slightly different form, on "Endtroducing.....".&amp;nbsp; There is value in having these tracks appear in their original form, but this leads to the second problem: the many tracks that were left &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt; this LP.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/discography"&gt;Shadow's discography&lt;/a&gt; is long and complicated, but even leaving off various remixes and production credits, few could deny that these songs &lt;i&gt;should have been&lt;/i&gt; collected on this LP: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1993's "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-asia-born"&gt;Entropy&lt;/a&gt;", from a split single with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrics_Born"&gt;Asia Born&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1994's "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-dj-krush-lost-found-sfl-kemuri"&gt;Lost and Found [S.F.L.]&lt;/a&gt;", from a split single with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Krush"&gt;DJ Krush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1996''s "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-chief-xcel"&gt;Hardcore (Instrumental) Hip Hop&lt;/a&gt;", from a joint release with the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/DJ+Shadow+And+The+Groove+Robbers"&gt;Groove Robbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1996's "Red Bus Needs To Leave!", "Midnight In A Perfect World (Gab Mix)", and "The Number Song (Cut Chemist Party Mix)" from the "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-midnight-perfect-world"&gt;Midnight In A Perfect World&lt;/a&gt;" single ("Red Bus Needs to Leave!" also appeared on the "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-stem"&gt;Stem&lt;/a&gt;" single).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;1997's "Untitled Heavy Beat", from the "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/end-violence-various-artists"&gt;End of Violence&lt;/a&gt;" soundtrack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1997's "Devil's Advocate (Heaven v. Hell Bonus Beat" from the "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-high-noon"&gt;High Noon&lt;/a&gt;" single    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Sure, that would have required this to have been a double LP, but some versions of "Preemptive Strike" also included the "&lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-q-bert-mix-camel-bobsled-race"&gt;Camel Bobsled Race&lt;/a&gt;" megamix LP, which truth be told isn't very good.&amp;nbsp; "Preemptive Strike" is an easy way to get to some of the early material from Shadow, including the essential "What Does Your Soul Look Like", but his early catalog deserves a more careful (even if not complete) compilation LP.&amp;nbsp; Here's what mine would look like, roughly in order of release:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO9jaj8pcWY"&gt;Entropy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H240VW2cTic"&gt;In/Flux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yh2h7SzKwg"&gt;Hindsight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWY8_Zuu1zM"&gt;Lost and Found [S.F.L.]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axg2N1D8V-g&amp;amp;feature=results_main&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;list=PLD161C48ED8ADE966"&gt;What Does Your Soul Look Like (parts 1-4)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OhmmEGLnSI"&gt;Hardcore (Instrumental) Hip Hop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kriSugLZrrE"&gt;Red Bus Needs To Leave!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxK6GzfhuTo"&gt;Midnight In A Perfect World (Gab Mix)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JedytPMwhpE"&gt;The Number Song (Cut Chemist Party Mix)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Untitled Heavy Beat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAwrHHafHwE"&gt;High Noon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinysong.com/112ZT"&gt;Devil's Advocate (Heaven v. Hell Bonus Beat)&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I'm not a big fan of "Organ Donor", so I left that off.&amp;nbsp; Some of the above tracks were collected on the bonus disc of the &lt;a href="http://www.djshadow.com/release/dj-shadow-endtroducing-deluxe-edition"&gt;deluxe edition&lt;/a&gt; of "Entroducing.....", but his early catalog deserves better treatment than it has received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 9/10.&amp;nbsp; Because of what it misses.</content>

    <title>Jim Carroll - "People Who Died" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345470+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RebBM50wfwA/T35GKTz8iAI/AAAAAAAAAmA/uLKDlurnicQ/s1600/jim-carroll-people-who-died.png"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 179px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RebBM50wfwA/T35GKTz8iAI/AAAAAAAAAmA/uLKDlurnicQ/s200/jim-carroll-people-who-died.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5728092918992635906" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Danette pointed out that memorials were becoming an unfortunate theme as of late (e.g., &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/03/montrose-i-got-fire-forgotten-song.html"&gt;Ronnie Montrose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/06/bruce-springsteen-blinded-by-light-song.html"&gt;Clarence Clemons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/05/rainbow-on-stage-lp-review.html"&gt;Ronnie James Dio&lt;/a&gt;) so naturally the appropriate song is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carroll"&gt;Jim Carroll&lt;/a&gt;'s "People Who Died", which tells the &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/114128/"&gt;autobiographical story&lt;/a&gt; from Carroll's 1978 book "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basketball_Diaries"&gt;Basketball Diaries&lt;/a&gt;" (and made into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basketball_Diaries_%28film%29"&gt;a film of the same name&lt;/a&gt; in 1995).  Aside from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basketball_Diaries_%28soundtrack%29"&gt;film's soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, the song originally appeared on The Jim Carroll Band's 1980 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Boy"&gt;Catholic Boy&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You occasionally hear this song on the radio, but only when they're playing alternative 80s or something like that.  That's too bad, because this is a great song and features prominently on several of my playlists.  The take away message from this song is: you and your friends aren't nearly as screwed up as Jim and his friends...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to learn that Jim Carroll recently (2009) joined the people who died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Carroll Band: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bOjc70f4p8"&gt;Basketball Diaries Film Video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBbuPnfG0Vo"&gt;live (198x?)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcloY9BlOU"&gt;studio version (with lyrics)&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Townes Van Zandt - "Pancho and Lefty" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345484+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FcJgzxVt5lo/T3dVNPvr9fI/AAAAAAAAAl0/suFFvhEg42k/s1600/townes-van-zandt-pancho-lefty.png"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 159px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FcJgzxVt5lo/T3dVNPvr9fI/AAAAAAAAAl0/suFFvhEg42k/s200/townes-van-zandt-pancho-lefty.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5726139137278080498" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In my previous post I introduced &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/03/montrose-i-got-fire-forgotten-song.html"&gt;Ronnie Montrose&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the concept of popular vs. influential.  Continuing in that theme we now look at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townes_Van_Zandt"&gt;Townes Van Zandt&lt;/a&gt;, a songwriter's songwriter.  You probably haven't heard of Townes, but he was an enormously influential on and respected by artists you do know, as we will see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason Townes never achieved greater fame is that he was his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townes_Van_Zandt#Addiction"&gt;own worst enemy&lt;/a&gt;, embodying all the cliches of "Bad Blake" in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Heart"&gt;Crazy Heart&lt;/a&gt;, but without the happy ending.  His &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townes_Van_Zandt#Death"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; could be a movie by itself.  Somewhere, Townes must have heard that you need to suffer to be a good songwriter... and he was a very good songwriter.  As &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Earle"&gt;Steve Earle&lt;/a&gt; once said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Van Zandt is] the best songwriter in the whole world and I'll stand on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan"&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt;'s coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that."&lt;/blockquote&gt;My first introduction to Van Zandt's music was long before I even knew who he was.  In 1983, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson"&gt;Willie Nelson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Haggard"&gt;Merle Haggard&lt;/a&gt; released a collaborative album entitled "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_%26_Lefty_%28album%29"&gt;Pancho &amp;amp; Lefty&lt;/a&gt;".  I had a lot of exposure to country music at the time because my mother played it 24-7 and even though I was into metal then, I knew "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_and_Lefty"&gt;Pancho and Lefty&lt;/a&gt;" was a compelling song. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tells the story of the two outlaws, Pancho now dead and Lefty retired (for the record: it is not about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa"&gt;Pancho Villa&lt;/a&gt;).  They live a hard life on the run, but perhaps their freedom is a farce:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;   All the Federales say&lt;br /&gt;   We could have had him any day.&lt;br /&gt;   We only let him slip away&lt;br /&gt;   Out of kindness, I suppose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eventually Pancho is "laid low" and Lefty escapes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;   The day they laid poor Pancho low,&lt;br /&gt;   Lefty split for Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;   Where he got the bread to go,&lt;br /&gt;   There ain't nobody knows.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The exact details of what happened are never revealed.  One reading of the song is that it is a retelling of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot#Betrayal_of_Jesus"&gt;universal theme of betrayal&lt;/a&gt;, but even though the evidence suggests otherwise I like to think Lefty didn't flip on Pancho (read the &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/122184/"&gt;rest of the lyrics&lt;/a&gt; to decide for yourself).  The story that Townes tells is simple, direct, and powerful; there are no wasted words.  It is a perfect match for Willie Nelson's voice, who absorbs the story and the way he sings the opening stanza gives me chills:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;   Living on the road my friend,      &lt;br /&gt;   Was gonna keep you free and clean.&lt;br /&gt;   Now you wear your skin like iron,&lt;br /&gt;   Your breath as hard as kerosene.&lt;br /&gt;   You weren't your mama's only boy,&lt;br /&gt;   But her favorite one it seems.&lt;br /&gt;   She began to cry when you said goodbye,&lt;br /&gt;   And sank into your dreams. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Before Willie and Merle recorded it, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmylou_Harris"&gt;Emmylou Harris&lt;/a&gt; recorded it for her 1977 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_Liner_%28album%29"&gt;Luxury Liner&lt;/a&gt;", and it first appeared on Towne's  1972 LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Late_Great_Townes_Van_Zandt"&gt;The Late Great Townes Van Zandt&lt;/a&gt;".  As you can see below, you can take almost any combination of country and folk singers and find a live version.  Some of the notable versions are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvdmxszsDM8"&gt;studio (1983)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iloyyrVt7EM"&gt;live &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsR0Y-sWk-E"&gt;live &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uIUe8iQPM0"&gt;live (2000)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmylou Harris: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMPydiR4NaQ"&gt;live (1977)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5wTVkLMSw8"&gt;live (2008)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Earle: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPOOE02sovk"&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMCJJkIR4pY"&gt;live (2009)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIsuNgdap84"&gt;live (2009)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Welch"&gt;Gillian Welch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rawlings"&gt;David Rawlings&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H3zlee_VRo"&gt;live (1997)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and of course:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Townes Van Zandt: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtzgwNDZAs4"&gt;live (1993)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZrAy6iXj7o"&gt;interview + live (1984)&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Montrose - "I Got the Fire" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345498+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8-N90Mt_vQ4/T3MrL6pB-ZI/AAAAAAAAAlo/rDmRXtR6vsc/s1600/montrose-hagar-i-got-the-fire.png"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 142px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8-N90Mt_vQ4/T3MrL6pB-ZI/AAAAAAAAAlo/rDmRXtR6vsc/s200/montrose-hagar-i-got-the-fire.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5724967035037940114" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I wanted to acknowledge the recent passing of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Montrose"&gt;Ronnie Montrose&lt;/a&gt;, the influential guitarist and founder of the band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrose_%28band%29"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt;.  Never heard of him?  That's because Ronnie nicely illustrates the difference between &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;influential&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;popular&lt;/span&gt;.  I only knew a little bit about Montrose during my metal years and never owned any of their LPs.  One reason I knew little of them is their popularity was brief and peaked in the mid-70s.  Apparently Ronnie was hard to work with and his interests wandered, not being especially interested in continuing to refine the formula of their successful &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrose_%28album%29"&gt;1973 eponymous LP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they had a huge impact on the bands that defined my metal years.  You might have known that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Hagar"&gt;Sammy Hagar&lt;/a&gt; got his start as the vocalist for Montrose (read &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/06/showbiz/music/sammy-hagar-tribute-ronnie-montrose-rs/index.html"&gt;Sammy's tribute to Ronnie&lt;/a&gt; in Rolling Stone).  What you might not have known is that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Van_Halen"&gt;Eddie Van Halen&lt;/a&gt; was heavily influenced by Ronnie, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen"&gt;Van Halen&lt;/a&gt; played Montrose covers during their bar band days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first introduction to them was via the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt; covers of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Got_the_Fire"&gt;I Got the Fire&lt;/a&gt;" (which Iron Maiden retitled "I've Got the Fire").  Robert Gordick had all of the import singles and EPs, including the 1980 "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_%28Iron_Maiden_song%29"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;" single whose b-side featured a live version with original vocalist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Di%27Anno"&gt;Paul Di'Anno&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the 1983 single "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_Icarus"&gt;Flight of Icarus&lt;/a&gt;" whose b-side featured a studio version of the song with the more famous vocalist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson"&gt;Bruce Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;.  I remember first hearing this song and being blown away by the riffs and hooks.  "I Got the Fire" originally appeared on the 1974 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Money"&gt;Paper Money&lt;/a&gt;", and was one of the last of the (original) collaborations between Sammy and Ronnie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Montrose songs are arguably more popular ("&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6BTTJo1KmM"&gt;Space Station #5&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUeuAnMNDhA"&gt;Rock Candy&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK71MdPXgRQ"&gt;Bad Motor Scooter&lt;/a&gt;"), but in part to the Iron Maiden covers, my favorite is "I Got the Fire".  Short, simple, and an unforgettable guitar riff.  Thanks to Ronnie for influencing the bands that influenced me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montrose: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhoYBnFi-WM"&gt;I Got the Fire&lt;/a&gt;" (live in the studio version)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iron Maiden (w/ Paul Di'Anno): "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhgUr-u36aE"&gt;I've Got the Fire&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iron Maiden (w/ Bruce Dickinson): "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhGprQSpFLc"&gt;I've Got the Fire&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>Rainbow - "Rising" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345511+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Sa4et3K-0sA/T0k_iLIL10I/AAAAAAAAAk0/hrQR7AhKiT4/s1600/rainbow-rising.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Sa4et3K-0sA/T0k_iLIL10I/AAAAAAAAAk0/hrQR7AhKiT4/s200/rainbow-rising.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5713167458631407426" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So here's my dilemma: I'd like to increase my hipster indie cred by writing more about artists like &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Autechre"&gt;Autechre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/The%20Caretaker"&gt;The Caretaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/balamacab"&gt;Balam Acab&lt;/a&gt;, etc. On the other hand, I also like it when people actually read what I write, and so far my two most popular reviews (in terms of page views) are &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/06/black-sabbath-vol-4-lp-review.html"&gt;Black Sabbath - "Vol. 4"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/05/rainbow-on-stage-lp-review.html"&gt;Rainbow - "On Stage"&lt;/a&gt;.  In the interest of more clicks, I'm digging up another high school era LP...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_%28band%29"&gt;Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;'s 2nd LP, 1976's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_%28Rainbow_album%29"&gt;Rising&lt;/a&gt;"*, is one of a handful of LPs that I have on both vinyl and CD; that should be some indication of how important I thought this LP was at a particular time.  I still remember purchasing the vinyl LP at the music store in the Newmarket North mall, ca. 1985.  I can't quite remember when I purchased the CD, but I think it was a few years later while I was in college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/05/rainbow-on-stage-lp-review.html"&gt;On Stage&lt;/a&gt;" review, Rainbow Mk. II was their best lineup: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_James_Dio"&gt;Ronnie James Dio&lt;/a&gt; (vocals), &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritchie_Blackmore"&gt;Ritchie Blackmore&lt;/a&gt; (guitar), &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Carey"&gt;Tony Carey&lt;/a&gt; (keyboards), &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Bain"&gt;Jimmy Bain&lt;/a&gt; (bass), and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_Powell"&gt;Cozy Powell&lt;/a&gt; (drums).  Sadly, they only made this one studio LP together (Rainbow's lineup changed for every single studio release), and although 1978's lineup for "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Live_Rock_%27n%27_Roll"&gt;Long Live Rock 'n' Roll&lt;/a&gt;" is similar, that LP isn't nearly as good.  Unlike "On Stage", I've always had mixed feelings about this LP.  At six songs and approximately 33 minutes, there is actually a lot to dislike about this LP, but an epic, 16 minute, two-song sequence makes this LP worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One song is ok ("Tarot Woman"), three songs are &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;awful&lt;/span&gt; ("Run With The Wolf", "Starstruck", "Do You Close Your Eyes"), and two songs are amazing ("Stargazer", "A Light in the Black").  The latter two songs formed side two of the vinyl record, so I pretty much pretended that there was only 1/2 of an LP to play.  "Starstruck" and "Do You Close Your Eyes" are especially bad: mid 70s blues rock songs that Dio simply can't pull off.  Related bands like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesnake"&gt;Whitesnake&lt;/a&gt; and later versions of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Purple"&gt;Deep Purple&lt;/a&gt; could do well with those kinds of songs, but Dio is best when he sticks within the epic fantasy genre.  "Tarot Woman" moves in that direction, but side two is where the LP shines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/69712/"&gt;Stargazer&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858552783/"&gt;A Light in the Black&lt;/a&gt;" form a two-part story of a person who (loosely summarizing) joins a cult and helps build a tower for a wizard who seeks to fly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;   In the heat and the rain&lt;br /&gt;With whips and chains&lt;br /&gt;To see him fly&lt;br /&gt;So many die&lt;br /&gt;We build a tower of stone&lt;br /&gt;With our flesh and bone&lt;br /&gt;Just to see him fly&lt;br /&gt;But we don't know why&lt;br /&gt;Now where do we go?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Of course, the wizard falls to the ground instead of flying and his former followers are left to ponder why and find their way back home (from ALITB):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;   Won't forget his face, what a lonely place&lt;br /&gt;Did he really let us go?&lt;br /&gt;All the time that's lost, what's the final cost&lt;br /&gt;Will I really get away?&lt;br /&gt;All my life it seems, just a crazy dream&lt;br /&gt;Reaching for somebody's star&lt;br /&gt;Can't believe it all, did he really fall?&lt;br /&gt;What to do now I don't know&lt;br /&gt;Somethings calling me back, like a light in the black&lt;br /&gt;Yes I'm ready to go&lt;br /&gt;I'm coming home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well...  I thought it was cool in HS.  "Stargazer" successfully integrates an orchestra with the music to give the appropriate epic, soundtrack quality.  "A Light in the Black" is stripped down and features Cozy Powell at his best: providing the solid foundation of the newly realized certainty of the character.  Tony Carey is excellent in both songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two songs provided the template for Dio's future direction in fantasy metal, both in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath#Heaven_and_Hell_and_Mob_Rules_.281979.E2.80.931982.29"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt; and later in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dio_%28band%29"&gt;Dio&lt;/a&gt;.  Sadly, this Rainbow line up gave us one great live LP and just one studio LP that was only half-great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkanocYiQ1Q"&gt;Tarot Woman&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK4bnnHb774"&gt;Stargazer&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r30xZmXq4zM"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32hlw7jacUI"&gt;A Light in the Black&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4k58u_rainbow-a-light-in-the-black-live-u_music"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g09-s3KETGI"&gt;Run With The Wolf&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GdbTUShbEM"&gt;Starstruck&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uT_tmyDrJw"&gt;Do You Close Your Eyes&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlIQzYq_Szw"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 7/10**.  I struggled with this one, but if you like Blackmore &amp;amp; Dio, this LP should be in your collection.  If you don't like them, this LP won't convince you otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link: the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Snq443TIkk"&gt;entire LP&lt;/a&gt; as a single YouTube track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Worthless trivia: The vinyl record was originally entitled "Rainbow Rising", with the artist being "Blackmore's Rainbow".  Additionally, their first LP was actually billed as by "Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow".  It wasn't until "On Stage" that the band's name was simply "Rainbow", and they retroactively retitled the first two LPs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I'm ready for the clicks to come pouring in!  Hopefully no nasty grams since this rated "only" a 7/10.</content>

    <title>Autechre - "Peel Session" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345525+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e0bca2G99TY/Tz_GNB4LhyI/AAAAAAAAAko/DL0j7FioSRg/s1600/autechre-peel-session.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 198px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e0bca2G99TY/Tz_GNB4LhyI/AAAAAAAAAko/DL0j7FioSRg/s200/autechre-peel-session.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5710500779673749282" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you don't like repetitive, electronic music you're not going to like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autechre"&gt;Autechre&lt;/a&gt;, who are in some ways electronica's answer to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass"&gt;Phillip Glass&lt;/a&gt;.  Herbert turned me on to Autechre (aka Sean Booth &amp;amp; Rob Brown) many years ago, and their 1999 EP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Session_%28Autechre_EP%29"&gt;Peel Session&lt;/a&gt;" is probably my favorite release of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first listen, Autechre's music seems rather simple: loops of different melodies and percussion gradually introduced, combined, retracted, modified, and reintroduced (thus the comparison with Glass).  Any single loop is simple enough, but their combination and the summation of their effect is surprisingly complex and hypnotic, and only reveals its full design after repeated listenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Peel Session" was recorded for and broadcast by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel"&gt;John Peel&lt;/a&gt; in 1995, but the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Autechre-Peel-Session/release/2506"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt; itself wasn't released until 1999.  At 25 minutes, it contains three songs in increasing length and complexity:  "Milk DX", "Inhake 2", and "Drane".  They're all good, but "Drane" is a hypnotic masterpiece (with some elements bordering on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegazing"&gt;shoegazing&lt;/a&gt;).  This EP has a more ambient feel than some of their more &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music"&gt;IDM&lt;/a&gt;-influenced releases, making it that much stronger in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQwz4Wz9xYc"&gt;Milk DX&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7avDpp-kiNM"&gt;Inhake 2&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQcwCOA0-8"&gt;Drane&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 8/10.  Don't play this as background music, because it will suck the air out of the room.</content>

    <title>The Clash - "Straight to Hell" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345539+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wrhT2Nh4gMM/TzFLqVxpNiI/AAAAAAAAAkM/RYN3HcucIto/s1600/The_Clash_Straight_to_Hell.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wrhT2Nh4gMM/TzFLqVxpNiI/AAAAAAAAAkM/RYN3HcucIto/s200/The_Clash_Straight_to_Hell.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5706425393627084322" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I just realized that while I had a &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/02/foo-fighters-best-of-you-song-remains.html"&gt;Super Bowl themed post last year&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't have one this year.  So just a few days late...  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt;?!  Admittedly this is one of the last bands you would associate with the Super Bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the tie-in:  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_%28entertainer%29"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt; did the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2uDs_IOoKw"&gt;half-time show&lt;/a&gt; this year and although she &lt;a href="http://earsucker.com/2012/did-madonna-lip-sync-during-super-bowl-half-time-show/"&gt;lip-synced&lt;/a&gt; (that's bad), it was still better than last year's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPIiaSnYV5E"&gt;oddly bland performance&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Eyed_Peas"&gt;Black Eyed Peas&lt;/a&gt; (anyone that says the BEPs performance was the worst ever must have forgotten about the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScA2FqJn9ic"&gt;2010 performance by The Who&lt;/a&gt;...).  One of Madonna's guests was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.I.A._%28artist%29"&gt;M.I.A.&lt;/a&gt;, who apparently &lt;a href="http://earsucker.com/2012/up-yours-nbc-censors-nicki-and-m-i-a-hit-and-run-the-half-time-show-with-profanitymiddle-finger/"&gt;flipped off&lt;/a&gt; somebody -- NBC, NFL, FCC, America, Madonna -- it isn't clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon reading about that my first reaction was "who?".  But then I remembered that M.I.A. did the song "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Planes"&gt;Paper Planes&lt;/a&gt;", made famous by being featured in the 2008 movie "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire"&gt;Slumdog Millionaire&lt;/a&gt;".  Of course, what made that song memorable is that it heavily samples from the last (proper) single by The Clash, 1982's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_to_Hell_%28song%29"&gt;Straight to Hell&lt;/a&gt;", from the LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_Rock"&gt;Combat Rock&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clash's last single was fittingly a great song, and although their lyrics deal with examples of immigration issues ca. 1982, it is still a proper summary of the &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/newts-gift-to-obama-a-gop-immigration-rift/249022/"&gt;GOP policy on immigration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There ain't no need for ya&lt;br /&gt;Go straight to hell boys&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Clash: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQwm1v1R-qM"&gt;Straight to Hell&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be2pMMYNzQ8"&gt;SNL 1982 live version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srvTTI1Wy8"&gt;stadium live version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;M.I.A. "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sei-eEjy4g"&gt;Paper Planes&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Allen"&gt;Lily Allen&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Mick Jones: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hsuVENZGlE"&gt;Straight to Hell&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;The Clash: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqH21LEmfbQ"&gt;Should I Stay or Should I Go&lt;/a&gt;" (B-Side to the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Clash-Should-I-Stay-Or-Should-I-Go-Straight-To-Hell/master/15077"&gt;1982 single&lt;/a&gt;).</content>

    <title>Roseanne Cash - "Seven Year Ache" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345553+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KYnvfGEDfo4/TxG-dP_F5jI/AAAAAAAAAj0/pvUU254DIhs/s1600/roseanne-cash-seven-year-ache.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KYnvfGEDfo4/TxG-dP_F5jI/AAAAAAAAAj0/pvUU254DIhs/s200/roseanne-cash-seven-year-ache.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5697544413317031474" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This has been driving me crazy for quite some time...  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt; songs are featured regularly at the Y (about the only place where Danette and I hear pop music).  Although it makes me a little ashamed, I have to admit Perry writes some strong hooks, with her 2010 single "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Dream_%28Katy_Perry_song%29"&gt;Teenage Dream&lt;/a&gt;" probably being my "favorite".  But the thing that always struck me was part of the song reminded me of what I thought was a 70s song; specifically how she sang the following lines, first occurring at 2:27--2:43 and repeated again at 3:23--3:40:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;   I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans&lt;br /&gt;   Be your teenage dream tonight&lt;br /&gt;   Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans&lt;br /&gt;   Be your teenage dream tonight&lt;/blockquote&gt;Last night at the Y I think I figured it out: I believe I'm thinking of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Year_Ache_%28song%29"&gt;Seven Year Ache&lt;/a&gt;", the country/pop cross-over single from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Year_Ache"&gt;1981 LP&lt;/a&gt; of the same name by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosanne_Cash"&gt;Roseanne Cash&lt;/a&gt;.  Yeah, so 1981 isn't quite "70s", but it is close enough.  I'm not claiming a copy or ripoff, just similarity: listen to the phrasing and structure of lines like (0:32--0:48):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Girls in the bars thinking who is this guy&lt;br /&gt;But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies&lt;br /&gt;You look so careless when they're shooting that bull&lt;br /&gt;Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full&lt;/blockquote&gt;as well as the chorus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Tell me your trying to cure a seven year ache&lt;br /&gt;See what else your old heart can take&lt;br /&gt;The boys say when is he gonna give us some room&lt;br /&gt;The girls say, God, I hope he comes back soon&lt;/blockquote&gt;and then compare to the Perry lines.  Danette confirmed that they were similar and said it was a good pull, but she may have just said that so I would shut up about it.  Anyway, I think I've uncovered the similarity that's been a pebble in my shoe every time we'd hear this song while working out.  And while it has been probably 10 minutes since you've heard a Katy Perry song, when was the last time you heard a Roseanne Cash song?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roseanne Cash -- "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrUs_FWqj9s"&gt;Seven Year Ache&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Katy Perry -- "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98WtmW-lfeE"&gt;Teenage Dream&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>Negativland - "U2" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345567+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NGL2i9GsJrY/Twh0wT3P0jI/AAAAAAAAAjo/9mrV5339XyU/s1600/negativland-u2.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5694930102124532274" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NGL2i9GsJrY/Twh0wT3P0jI/AAAAAAAAAjo/9mrV5339XyU/s200/negativland-u2.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 196px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where would &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativland"&gt;Negativland&lt;/a&gt;'s career be without "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2_%28EP%29"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt;", the 1991 two song EP that took aim at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Kasem"&gt;Casey Kasem&lt;/a&gt; and the band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt;?  On one hand, the resulting legal firestorm from Island Records (U2's label) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SST_Records"&gt;SST&lt;/a&gt; (Negativland's label) nearly ruined the band financially.  On the other hand, the accompanying attention greatly increased the profile of the band, as well as giving them a nearly limitless source of future material.  Perhaps the wreckage was the inevitable conclusion for the band that invented the term "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming#1984_Coinage"&gt;culture jamming&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Island Records claimed that the cover art was intended to confuse buyers, who would think it is a release from U2 entitled "Negativland".  Negativland countered that the band U2 doesn't have exclusive rights to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_U-2"&gt;letter U and the numeral 2&lt;/a&gt;.  Island was also unhappy with the extensive sampling of U2's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Still_Haven%27t_Found_What_I%27m_Looking_For"&gt;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&lt;/a&gt;".  Negativland countered that this was covered under &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use"&gt;fair use&lt;/a&gt;.  The fight is documented in an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Use:_The_Story_of_the_Letter_U_and_the_Numeral_2"&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Letter_U_and_the_Numeral_2"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; from Negativland, but here's the short version: Island has a lot of $, and Negativland and SST don't.  Island wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EP was withdrawn from SST's catalog (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dpopular&amp;amp;field-keywords=negativland+u2&amp;amp;x=11&amp;amp;y=7"&gt;surviving copies&lt;/a&gt; can bring big $) and hastily replaced with the EP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/08/negativland-guns-lp-review.html"&gt;Guns&lt;/a&gt;", whose cover art continues the commentary on the situation.  The two songs themselves are freely available on the &lt;a href="http://negativland.com/"&gt;band's web site&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2001 the band re-released the songs (along with live versions and other situational commentary) on the LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Guys_Are_from_England_and_Who_Gives_a_Shit"&gt;These Guys Are From England and Who Gives a Shit&lt;/a&gt;" (the quote is from Casey Kasem's abusive and profane rant about the "death dedications", the band U2, and Kasem's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology_of_the_British_Isles"&gt;confusion about Ireland vs. England&lt;/a&gt;; the shock value is much higher for those familiar with Kasem, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Top_40"&gt;American Top 40&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Top_40#Censorship.2C_offensive_songs_and_affiliate_standards"&gt;squeaky clean image&lt;/a&gt;).  As far as I know this LP (released on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeland_Records"&gt;Seeland Records&lt;/a&gt;, Negativland's own label) generated no controversy; I guess Island and SST no longer thought it worth their while.  You owe it to yourself to get TGAFEAWGAS, but in the mean time you can find the two original mp3s directly from the band.   Lost in the story &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;about&lt;/span&gt; these songs is the fact that the songs themselves are quite entertaining. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For (1991 A Capella Mix)" (&lt;a href="http://www.negativland.com/archives/020u2/acapella.mp3"&gt;negativland.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqse3vYcnaU"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;); "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For (Special Edit Radio Mix)" (&lt;a href="http://www.negativland.com/archives/020u2/special_edit_radio_mix.mp3"&gt;negativland.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dfsuu6V8Tw"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10.  Snuggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link: A YouTube playlist of Mark Hosler at the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=D4F9763B9639CC6A"&gt;47th Ann Arbor Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, talking about Negativland.  I'm going to eventually review some of their full-length LPs...</content>

    <title>Ice-T - "99 Problems" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345580+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fjeXWWb1Czc/TvynSleMRBI/AAAAAAAAAjc/d6EnvVijHm4/s1600/ice-t-99-problems.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5691607966827693074" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fjeXWWb1Czc/TvynSleMRBI/AAAAAAAAAjc/d6EnvVijHm4/s200/ice-t-99-problems.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 197px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twice was interesting, but upon hearing the third "version" of this song convinced me there was something afoot: three completely different songs, sharing only the memorable chorus and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Problems"&gt;99 Problems&lt;/a&gt;" was made famous in 2004 by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z"&gt;Jay-Z&lt;/a&gt; as a single of his LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Album_%28Jay-Z_album%29"&gt;The Black Album&lt;/a&gt;" but it was originally a (different) song by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-T"&gt;Ice-T&lt;/a&gt;.  Ice-T never released it as a single, but instead was a B-side from the "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Ice-T-Thats-How-Im-Livin-99-Problems/release/3298223"&gt;That's How I'm Livin'&lt;/a&gt;" single (from his 1993 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Invasion_%28album%29"&gt;Home Invasion&lt;/a&gt;"). Guesting on the Ice-T version is Brother Marquis from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Live_Crew"&gt;2 Live Crew&lt;/a&gt;, and the song is typical of both their styles at that time: juvenile sex rhymes.  The "bitches and hos" misogyny is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; over the top, I tell myself it is like the cartoon violence in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Bill"&gt;Kill Bill&lt;/a&gt; -- you shouldn't be offended because it isn't meant to be taken seriously.  Regardless, the song gave us a memorable chorus with a great hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay-Z must have agreed since he lifted the chorus for his 2004 single.  He replaced the sex stories with autobiographical stories about police, music critics, the street, etc.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin"&gt;Rick Rubin&lt;/a&gt; is the producer of this song, and while Jay-Z obviously raps, Rick's influence turns this into what has to be one of the heaviest metal songs ever (see also: Rick Rubin and Johnny Cash in "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/05/johnny-cash-gods-gonna-cut-you-down_15.html"&gt;God's Gonna Cut You Down&lt;/a&gt;").  As Jay-Z says at the end "You're crazy for this one, Rick".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so Jay-Z reworking an Ice-T song isn't that much of a stretch...  But this summer, Danette's sister, Julie, played a bluegrass version of "99 Problems" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_%28musician%29"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.  Julie was unaware of the prior versions and that is what convinced me that the song (or at least the chorus) was on its way to becoming a traditional song (or at least a musical version of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats_%28joke%29"&gt;The Aristocrats&lt;/a&gt;").   I don't know that much about Hugo, but there is a connection since he is signed to Jay-Z's label &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_Nation"&gt;Roc Nation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will be the next installment in the series?  Where do you go from rap, to rap/metal, to bluegrass?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice-T: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bicN4ryVQSI"&gt;99 Problems&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay-Z: "&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/50802768"&gt;99 Problems&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LloIp0HMJjc"&gt;99 Problems&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Mouse"&gt;Danger Mouse&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtfEYuZhDjo"&gt;99 Problems&lt;/a&gt;" (A mashup of Jay-Z's version with "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helter_Skelter_%28song%29"&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/a&gt;" from the semi-official LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grey_Album"&gt;The Grey Album&lt;/a&gt;".)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick_Daddy"&gt;Trick Daddy&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHmsm7sB1dA"&gt;99 Problems&lt;/a&gt;" (From his 2001 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thugs_Are_Us"&gt;Thugs Are Us&lt;/a&gt;"; this version is basically part 2 of the Ice-T version.  Not really a cover, but neither is it a new version like the others listed above.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay-Z and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phish"&gt;Phish&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;a href="http://www.milkandcookies.com/link/49366/detail/"&gt;99 Problems&lt;/a&gt;" (Not all combinations work well...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice-T: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x1WIOp4gEo"&gt;That's How I'm Livin'&lt;/a&gt;" (The original A-side of the single.)</content>

    <title>Liz Phair - "Juvenilia" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345594+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Gxl4Mkw6wO8/TvukH4lmMHI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/zRjs7GEgwjo/s1600/liz-phair-juvenilia.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5691323009468870770" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Gxl4Mkw6wO8/TvukH4lmMHI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/zRjs7GEgwjo/s200/liz-phair-juvenilia.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 1995 EP "Juvenilia" was basically an extended single for the song "Jealousy" from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Phair"&gt;Liz Phair&lt;/a&gt;'s excellent 1994 sophomore LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip-Smart"&gt;Whip-Smart&lt;/a&gt;".  In addition to "Jealousy", there are two new songs and five "old" songs from her fabled &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girlysound"&gt;Girlysound&lt;/a&gt; demo tapes (nearly impossible to get in 1995).  Liz mined those demo tapes for a majority of the material on her first three LPs, but the LP versions were always re-recorded with full-production, band members, etc.  To the best of my knowledge, "Juvenilia" was the first time she released songs straight from Girlysound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, their sound is pretty bare: just Liz strumming a guitar and a few multi-tracked vocals.  No bass, no drums, just Liz with her attitude &amp;amp; guitar.  Honestly, that's really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you need this EP?  Well, how big a fan are you?  "Jealousy" is a great song, but this is the same version that is on "Whip-Smart".  Of the new tracks, she does a decent cover of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Japanese"&gt;Turning Japanese&lt;/a&gt;" (originally by the one-hit wonders, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vapors"&gt;The Vapors&lt;/a&gt;) but I never really cared that much for the original.  The other new track, "Animal Girl", is not really bad, but isn't memorable either (foreshadowing for later material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the Girlysound tracks, "California", "South Dakota", "Batmobile", "Dead Shark", and "Easy", only "Dead Shark" is close to being weak.  The first two tracks are excellent, and I wonder why were never re-recorded for inclusion on later LPs.  "California" was re-released on the 2nd half of 2010's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funstyle"&gt;Funstyle&lt;/a&gt;", but I believe "Juvenilia" is the only in-print option to get the other four Girlysound tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmjIHqr1SR0"&gt;Jealousy&lt;/a&gt;",  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_LiZctDjgs"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM5n8023hrY"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skXhXdDNOjk"&gt;Batmobile&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://tny.gs/sEvcBw"&gt;Easy&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXQxw3YqGF0"&gt;Turning Japanese&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVTQZxV_Yno"&gt;Animal Girl&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naQVnCTG-x8"&gt;Dead Shark&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 7/10.  This one is hard to score.  If you're a big fan, you already have this.  If you're not a big fan, then her demo tapes aren't the place to start.  I settled on a "7" since any serious collector should have this.</content>

Zomes isn't actually a band, but an alias for &lt;a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/artists/?id=11877"&gt;Asa Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;, the guitarist for the punk-band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungfish_%28band%29"&gt;Lungfish&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm not familiar with Osbourne, Lungfish, or some of the other various related projects, so I'm reviewing this LP without the context of Osbourne's prior work (two good reviews of the LP by someone familiar his oeuvre can be found at "&lt;a href="http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/4691"&gt;dusted&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://hardcorefornerds.blogspot.com/2008/09/zomes-st.html"&gt;hardcore for nerds&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This LP is a mesmerizing, minimalist, fuzzy, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_music"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt; record that features a lot heavily processed guitar.  Knowing what I now know  about Osbourne, it makes sense to me that this is basically electronic music as envisioned and executed in a decidedly organic, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_ethic"&gt;DIY-punk aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;.   If &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Shields"&gt;Kevin Shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno"&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass"&gt;Phillip Glass&lt;/a&gt; listened to a bunch of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramones"&gt;Ramones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop"&gt;Iggy Pop&lt;/a&gt; LPs and then went on a weekend recording bender, it would sound like this.  Butch turned me on to this LP, I love it, and I turned Herbert on to it.  If you've been reading this blog regularly, you'll know that's a good indication of the breadth of interests to which this LP appeals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand out songs: Although it has 16 tracks (owing to its punk roots, none stick around that long), this is not the kind of LP for which you have favorite tracks.  Listen to the whole thing at &lt;a href="http://grooveshark.com/album/Zomes/5804282"&gt;grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;.  Some representative songs include: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8WPYeI58kU"&gt;Crowning Orbs&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb2m-Lc0RII"&gt;Clear Shapes&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faMddZg2FaE"&gt;Colored Matter&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10.  Deceptively simple, you'll be surprised how often you replay this.</content>

    <title>The Cribs - "Ignore the Ignorant" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345622+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AEOqFIQl2Uc/TvZgmm8i9OI/AAAAAAAAAi4/-Zh08mxmoHs/s1600/cribs-ignore-the-ignorant.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AEOqFIQl2Uc/TvZgmm8i9OI/AAAAAAAAAi4/-Zh08mxmoHs/s200/cribs-ignore-the-ignorant.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5689841395634992354" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I've been putting this one off for almost two years now...  Here's the short version: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs"&gt;The Cribs'&lt;/a&gt; fourth LP, 2009's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignore_the_Ignorant"&gt;Ignore the Ignorant&lt;/a&gt;", is a good LP, but the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/36794-johnny-marr-talks-about-the-cribs-and-modest-mouse-not-about-the-smiths/"&gt;addition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Marr"&gt;Johnny Marr&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 ultimately hurt them more than it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is ok to speak of this now, since in April The Cribs announced that Johnny Marr had &lt;a href="http://www.thecribs.com/news.php?id=219"&gt;left the band amicably&lt;/a&gt;.  While I respect Marr &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths"&gt;The Smiths&lt;/a&gt;, and The Cribs have a history of working with a number of alt-rock veterans (e.g., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ranaldo"&gt;Lee Renaldo&lt;/a&gt; on "&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/1882847"&gt;Be Safe&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/jonslade"&gt;Jon Slade&lt;/a&gt; on "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU8_XIQj9ZI"&gt;Advice From a Roving Artist&lt;/a&gt;"), I'm first and foremost a Cribs fan.  And although I liked the idea of an extended collaboration with Johnny, it just didn't work as well as it might have.   I'm glad they tried it; the Jarman brothers are cool with it, Johnny is cool with it, so I can be cool with it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary problem with this LP is the song writing is not as crisp as it was on their previous releases.  Perhaps that reflects the presence of Johnny Marr upsetting the song writing dynamic of the Jarman brothers: either his input didn't always mesh with them, or maybe they changed their style to accommodate him (Marr is about finesse, while The Cribs, let's be honest, are at their best just bashing it out).  Or maybe it is just The Cribs are no longer "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY-Msc_sksc"&gt;sixteen and really bored&lt;/a&gt;" (I lifted that association from someone, but I've forgotten where) and they're not going to have that earnest urgency of their youth.  Whatever the reason, it seems like there are fewer Cribs trademarks: sing-along choruses, hooks and memorable riffs, and vocal trade-offs between twins Gary and Ryan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secondary but still critical problem with this LP is its production.  Producer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Launay"&gt;Nick Launay&lt;/a&gt; should be shot.  Yes, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kapranos"&gt;Alex Krapanos&lt;/a&gt;'s entry in the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"&gt;loudness war&lt;/a&gt;" from the &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-mens-needs-womens-needs-whatever.html"&gt;previous LP&lt;/a&gt; is gone, but in its place Launay appeared to have recorded the band from a building next door to where they were playing, with the music piped through a muddy tube.  He's managed to find the no man's land between the (overly) bright loudness of the prior LP and the endearing lo-fi sound of their first two.  Please work with &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-new-fellas-lp-review.html"&gt;Edywn Collins&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the addition of Marr and his influence on the song writing, I'm going to break with my typical review structure and instead go song-by-song (all songs are listed as co-written by all four band members):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxkqEMXEHv0"&gt;We Were Aborted&lt;/a&gt;: Wow, what a strong start.  Although not officially released as a single, the band made this song a free download prior to the release of the LP.  Lyrically and musically, this song rawks as hard as any of their earlier material (i.e., it sounds pre-Marr).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkJDKdOlUGQ"&gt;Cheat on Me&lt;/a&gt;: This was their first single from the LP and it is a great song.  I hear a small Marr influence in the guitar riffs, but it works great and if the entire LP sounded like this I'd have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DbcAl3EbIs"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We Share The Same Skies&lt;/a&gt;: Their 2nd (and last) single sounds like a long-lost demo from The Smiths.  If &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey"&gt;Morrisey&lt;/a&gt; ever did a cover of this song, you'd swear it would belong on "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louder_Than_Bombs"&gt;Louder Than Bombs&lt;/a&gt;".  It is actually a good song, but it doesn't sound like The Cribs at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6nu845BIco"&gt;City of Bugs&lt;/a&gt;: WTF?!  Where did this &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt; sound-alike come from?  It is also a pretty good song, even though it doesn't "sound like" The Cribs until the break about 3 minutes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGtms9EAmmE"&gt;Hari Kari&lt;/a&gt;: An almost classic Cribs song.  All the pieces are there, but they just don't come together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pucTdO_5TPE"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Year's Snow&lt;/a&gt;: Similar to "We Share The Same Skies"; Gary belts this one out, but it would be easy to imagine Morrisey singing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMV8pAApNs"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emasculate Me&lt;/a&gt;: Like "Hari Kari" above; it sounds like someone else (Marr?) trying to write a song that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;sounds like&lt;/span&gt; The Cribs.  Skip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEbmUNPyDBE"&gt;Ignore the Ignorant&lt;/a&gt;: The title track is strong, sounds like The Cribs, and is a primary exhibit for what a bad job Launay did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxNtHb2kByY"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save Your Secrets&lt;/a&gt;: Another song that appears to have all the elements, but they never come together.  It treads dangerously close to piano ballad territory.  Skip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF6ZkutmGXo"&gt;Nothing&lt;/a&gt;: This sounds like an outtake from "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-mens-needs-womens-needs-whatever.html"&gt;Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever&lt;/a&gt;".  Hooks, scream-along chorus, the whole thing.  Great song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AH-QRDChQ0"&gt;Victim of Mass Production&lt;/a&gt;: On any of their other LPs, this would be considered a weak song.  The influence of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Replacements_%28band%29"&gt;The Replacements&lt;/a&gt; can be heard here ("we're not supposed to be here anyway!").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJRybNqURZE"&gt;Stick To Yr Guns&lt;/a&gt;: A pretty good song, similar to pre-Marr songs like "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNLi5j-WoI0"&gt;Shoot The Poets&lt;/a&gt;" and "Haunted".  This is the song that "Save Your Secrets" (above) wanted to be but failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the above adds up to a good, solid LP that should be in your collection.  And if you've never heard of The Cribs, you'll probably even like this more -- at least until you discover how excellent their prior work is.  Yes, I realize going on about how much better their earlier LPs are is so cliche that it deserves its own song (cf. "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLKL6iUFSQQ"&gt;Our Bovine Public&lt;/a&gt;").   On the other hand, &lt;a href="http://www.nme.com/reviews/the-cribs/10795"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13709-ignore-the-ignorant/"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt; rate this LP highly because their trying to make up for completely whiffing on their earlier LPs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully their future work will return to their lo-fi roots and we'll just think of "Ignore the Ignorant" as a curious collaboration that lasted 2+ years and produced over one LP's worth of material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 7/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* In typical Cribs' fashion, there are plenty of bonus tracks and b-sides from these sessions.  The ones I know of are: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8ZBfNlJ_p8"&gt;Is Anybody There?&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVRBWGBFaoU"&gt;Curse This English Rain&lt;/a&gt;", and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK_9buEsktI"&gt;So Hot Now&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* In August 2010, the 4-piece Cribs released a one-sided &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-Housewife/release/2564551"&gt;7"&lt;/a&gt; single, "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKciOAXMxk0"&gt;Housewife&lt;/a&gt;".  It's not a bad song, but it is so different I'm not entirely sure what to make of it.</content>

This was their second and final LP; I have no idea what happened to them after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squarely in the late 70s / early 80s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_music"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt; mode (check out the shirts in the video!), this song still sounds pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Picture Me With You" -- &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RYL3E22JNA"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt; (@ &lt;a href="http://findlocal.dailypress.com/listings/club-rogues-virginia-beach"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt; in Va Beach), &lt;a href="http://forgotten80s.podomatic.com/entry/2006-11-27T11_18_28-08_00"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Deathprod - "Treetop Drive 1-3, Towboat" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345669+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XK5CIWS_6nc/TpNP9nZ0qFI/AAAAAAAAAhs/jjNNy4eKCKI/s1600/deathprod-treetop-drive.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5661957076502751314" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XK5CIWS_6nc/TpNP9nZ0qFI/AAAAAAAAAhs/jjNNy4eKCKI/s200/deathprod-treetop-drive.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here's another one for Butch @ &lt;a href="http://www.squealermusic.com/"&gt;Squealer Music&lt;/a&gt;.  I see Butch once or twice a year and we use the time to catch up on music.  Our interests overlap in the areas of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music"&gt;ambient&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_metal"&gt;doom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_doom"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_metal"&gt;stoner&lt;/a&gt; -- basically all the sub-genres that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt; spawned (see my review of "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/06/black-sabbath-vol-4-lp-review.html"&gt;Vol. 4&lt;/a&gt;").  One of the artists that Butch turned me on to is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathprod"&gt;Deathprod&lt;/a&gt; (aka Helge Sten).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hearing Deathprod from Butch, I bought the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathprod_%28album%29"&gt;eponymous 4-CD boxset&lt;/a&gt; (released in 2004).  I wasn't sure at what granularity that I wanted to review the music: 4 LPs in a single review?  Instead, I review them separately starting with my favorite LP from the set, 1994's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Deathprod-Treetop-Drive-1-3-Towboat/release/102635"&gt;Treetop Drive 1-3, Towboat&lt;/a&gt;" (yes, the LP title is simply the listing of the LP's four tracks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewing this LP is actually rather hard -- Sten is generally credited on LPs with "Audio Virus", and that's about as good an explanation as you'll find.  There is almost no percussion, just swaths of looped, foreboding sounds.  Here's a string of words I'd associate with the music in general: dark, powerful, repetitive, nightmarish, mesmerizing, plodding, haunting, homemade, menacing, stalking, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger"&gt;Giger&lt;/a&gt;-esque.  Similar in a sense to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastikman"&gt;Plastikman&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumed_%28album%29"&gt;Consumed&lt;/a&gt;" in results, but far more organic and, well, viral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll attempt another comparison:  on the "&lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/29/"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;" episode of &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/"&gt;Radiolab&lt;/a&gt;, they describe "&lt;a href="http://www.expandedfield.net/"&gt;9 Beet Stretch&lt;/a&gt;", which is Beethoven's 9th Symphony stretched out to 24 hours in length.  "Treetop Drive 1-3, Towboat" could easily be excerpts of MBV's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/05/my-bloody-valentine-loveless-lp-review.html"&gt;Loveless&lt;/a&gt;" with the same stretch treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treetop Drive 1 sounds like an interpretation of a series of looped, slow-motion car wrecks.  Treetop Drive 2 sounds like warring, maniacal channel buoys.  Treetop Drive 3 sounds like a plague of locusts, and features a narration of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So there's a strange affinity with death. Many school districts today are teaching a death education, where they take first graders, second, and third graders and acquaint them with death: Not in the concept of life after death, but with death itself. And, kids are being taken to mortuaries and are allowed to see, and even touch, dead bodies. There is this fascination with death, to desensitize us to death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is the only thing that passes for vocals in the LP, and I have no idea where this is sampled from.  But my favorite song is the LP closer "Towboat".  It starts off pretty minimalist, then slowly builds an aural description of a conflict, closing with what sounds like (abstracted) machine gun fire in the last 4-5 minutes of the track.  This could easily be the dream soundtrack of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now"&gt;Willard&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness"&gt;Kurtz&lt;/a&gt; going up the river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqMJ5qJEAQI"&gt;Treetop Drive 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhmjwmv05OA"&gt;Treetop Drive 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vil5dYXRn8g"&gt;Treetop Drive 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/jR24XfVxXvc/"&gt;Towboat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 8/10.  Not light background listening, but powerful and important.</content>

    <title>Blink-182 - "Josie" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345683+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HM-06cH6DB8/ToHnuixCNaI/AAAAAAAAAhk/HMiioxv9BtE/s1600/blink-182-josie.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HM-06cH6DB8/ToHnuixCNaI/AAAAAAAAAhk/HMiioxv9BtE/s200/blink-182-josie.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5657057393746523554" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For Danette's birthday...  last year it was "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/09/dead-milkmen-punk-rock-girl-forgotten.html"&gt;Punk Rock Girl&lt;/a&gt;" and we might as well continue the punk theme this year too, in part because I think pop-punk band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink-182"&gt;Blink-182&lt;/a&gt; has written the world's best love song -- "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_%28Everything%27s_Gonna_Be_Fine%29"&gt;Josie&lt;/a&gt;".  A single from their 1998 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dude_Ranch_%28album%29"&gt;Dude Ranch&lt;/a&gt;", it received a good deal of airplay when it came out, but it seems to have fallen through the  radio genre cracks: not new enough for progressive rock, and certainly not quite classic rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world's best love song?  Absolutely, and here's why: Blink-182 has a sharp sense of humor (unlike, say, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day"&gt;Green Day&lt;/a&gt;), but in this case they've laid bare the unvarnished truths of the male psyche, which are too simple for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_%28magazine%29"&gt;Cosmo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City"&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/a&gt;, et al. to explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;   Yeah my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive   &lt;br /&gt; And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys&lt;br /&gt; She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does&lt;br /&gt; She brings me Mexican food from &lt;a href="http://www.sombreromex.com/"&gt;Sombrero&lt;/a&gt; just because&lt;br /&gt; Yeah, just because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And my girlfriend likes &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unwritten_Law"&gt;UL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Hall_Crashers"&gt;DHC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And she's so smart and independent&lt;br /&gt; I don't think she needs me&lt;br /&gt; Quite half as much as I know I need her&lt;br /&gt; I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down&lt;br /&gt; I show up at three a.m. she's still up watching &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Vacation"&gt;Vacation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place&lt;br /&gt; And I know that everything's gonna be fine&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes, that's pretty much it.  From Blink-182's perspective "Josie" is fictional (the name comes from the neighbor's dog), but that's only because &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hoppus"&gt;Mark Hoppus&lt;/a&gt; doesn't know Danette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGaD7WngJwU"&gt;Josie&lt;/a&gt;" (unofficial video with lyrics; watch this one)&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC-fHrlFgb8"&gt;Josie&lt;/a&gt;" (official video; it's funny but the video's story has absolutely nothing to do with the lyrics)</content>

    <title>R.E.M. - "Superman" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345698+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5eyUmEFJ2vY/ToEAxj0TQzI/AAAAAAAAAhc/UVGqH_AwTFQ/s1600/rem-superman.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 198px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5eyUmEFJ2vY/ToEAxj0TQzI/AAAAAAAAAhc/UVGqH_AwTFQ/s200/rem-superman.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5656803458382250802" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Less than a week ago, &lt;a href="http://remhq.com/news_story.php?id=1446"&gt;R.E.M. decided to hang it up&lt;/a&gt; after 31 years.  Drummer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M._%28band%29#Berry.27s_departure_and_Up:_1997.E2.80.932000"&gt;Bill Berry had already retired&lt;/a&gt; 14 years ago (!), so I suppose they did the right thing in calling it quits before attrition whittled down the three remaining original members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's where I have to confess that although I like R.E.M. well enough, I never &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;loved&lt;/span&gt; R.E.M.  Sure, I have a handful of their LPs, I enjoy most of their stuff, and I recognize their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M._%28band%29#Legacy"&gt;centrality&lt;/a&gt; in defining the 80s college rock sound.  And thanks to the late &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/caroltaylorwnor"&gt;Carol Taylor&lt;/a&gt; (FM99), everyone in Hampton Roads heard them before most did (she was playing "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe_%28song%29"&gt;Radio Free Europe&lt;/a&gt;" in 83/84).  I remember Earl Lindford's band (I don't recall their name) playing "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_Get_There_from_Here"&gt;Can't Get There From Here&lt;/a&gt;" at the 86 or 87 Denbigh Jam (see also: &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/dag-nasty-wig-out-at-denkos-forgotten.html"&gt;Tone Deaf&lt;/a&gt;).  In short, unless you're from Athens, GA I probably heard about them before you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was much later in life (mid-90s?) that I was surprised to discover that my favorite song by R.E.M. was actually a cover.  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_%28The_Clique_song%29"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt;", the second and last single from 1986's LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifes_Rich_Pageant"&gt;Lifes Rich Pageant&lt;/a&gt;" (arguably their last truly alternative LP), was actually originally released in 1969 by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clique_%28Texas_band%29"&gt;The Clique&lt;/a&gt;, as the b-side to their single "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Clique-Sugar-On-Sunday-Superman/release/1507507"&gt;Sugar on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;".  Furthermore, the lead vocals on the R.E.M. version are from bassist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mills"&gt;Mike Mills&lt;/a&gt; instead of lead singer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stipe"&gt;Michael Stipe&lt;/a&gt;.  That's right, my favorite R.E.M. song is not written by R.E.M. and has Michael Stipe on just background vocals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I was never the biggest R.E.M. fan, their retirement is too important to ignore.  I might eventually review some of their LPs, but for the near-term this will have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.E.M.: "&lt;a href="http://tinysong.com/K6Je"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt;"; (a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtFCEhLQKmQ"&gt;YouTube version&lt;/a&gt; with bad sound quality, but you have to love the I.R.S. 45rpm single)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clique: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g-O4FntXPs"&gt;Superman&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Links:&lt;br /&gt;R.E.M.: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZx30VWVM7o"&gt;White Tornado&lt;/a&gt;" (b-side to the 7" single).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clique: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr_bEMtUU70"&gt;Sugar on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;" (a-side to their 7" single).</content>

    <title>Bruce Springsteen - "The Ghost of Tom Joad" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345712+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lqSiQb9-oDo/TmUHr8f-1TI/AAAAAAAAAhQ/Khs8p5kBceg/s1600/bruce-springsteen-tom-joad.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5648929759162193202" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lqSiQb9-oDo/TmUHr8f-1TI/AAAAAAAAAhQ/Khs8p5kBceg/s200/bruce-springsteen-tom-joad.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day"&gt;Labor Day&lt;/a&gt; special...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the condensed version of the conversation I've had dozens of times with some of my European friends: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen"&gt;Bruce Springsteen&lt;/a&gt; is an activist / protest singer in the tradition of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie"&gt;Woody Guthrie&lt;/a&gt;, but his songs are written with such a distinctly American, individualistic perspective that the message of struggle, hope &amp;amp; despair, and identity is often obscured, if not completely misunderstood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to some of his more indirect songs, "&lt;a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/the-ghost-of-tom-joad"&gt;The Ghost of Tom Joad&lt;/a&gt;", the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_of_Tom_Joad_%28song%29"&gt;title track&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_of_Tom_Joad"&gt;1995 LP&lt;/a&gt; of the same name, is one of Bruce's most overtly political songs.  The blistering message is tamed by Bruce's muted, acoustic delivery; it was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine"&gt;Rage Against the Machine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Rage-Against-The-Machine-The-Ghost-Of-Tom-Joad/master/180117"&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt; that realized the inherent, well, "rage" of the narrator against forces so complex and overwhelming that individuals must succumb.  In Bruce's songs, the hero can often overcome through sheer force of will (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/badlands"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/the-promised-land"&gt;The Promised Land&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/thunder-road"&gt;Thunder Road&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/born-to-run"&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt;") -- or at least believes he can.  In "The Ghost of Tom Joad", the hero is bleakly aware of his futile state:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Men walkin' 'long the railroad tracks&lt;br /&gt;Goin' someplace there's no goin' back&lt;br /&gt;Highway patrol choppers comin' up over the ridge&lt;br /&gt;Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge&lt;br /&gt;Shelter line stretchin' round the corner&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the new world order&lt;br /&gt;Families sleepin' in their cars in the southwest&lt;br /&gt;No home no job no peace no rest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highway is alive tonight&lt;br /&gt;But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes&lt;br /&gt;I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light&lt;br /&gt;Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tom Joad is of course the main character and anti-hero in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck"&gt;Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt;'s 1940 novel "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath"&gt;The Grapes of Wrath&lt;/a&gt;", which tells the fictionalized story of the Joad family's travels from Oklahoma during the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl"&gt;dust bowl&lt;/a&gt; to California in search of a land, jobs, and a better life.  Instead, they find California is controlled by corporate farmers, in collusion with each other as well as local law enforcement to ensure an ample supply of cheap, unorganized labor.  In short, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Wisconsin_protests"&gt;dream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Now Tom said "Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy&lt;br /&gt;Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries&lt;br /&gt;Where there's a fight 'gainst the blood and hatred in the air&lt;br /&gt;Look for me Mom I'll be there&lt;br /&gt;Wherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand&lt;br /&gt;Or decent job or a helpin' hand&lt;br /&gt;Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free&lt;br /&gt;Look in their eyes Mom you'll see me."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Bruce Springsteen: &lt;a href="http://www.cmt.com/videos/bruce-springsteen/94921/the-ghost-of-tom-joad.jhtml?artist=975"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKKpmbcSe5E"&gt;live in the studio 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce Springsteen &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Morello"&gt;Tom Morello&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWmUKr7iqZQ"&gt;live 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rage Against the Machine: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjGmNYihLoM"&gt;1997 single version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;2000 LP version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMaCg4fpJKg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIEHCSHa98k"&gt;live 1999 version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqnMrynpq9U"&gt;fan video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Grapes of Wrath": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYFJmm0aK-8"&gt;New York Times Review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGky0q2j_78"&gt;ReThink Review&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Lissy Trullie - "Self-Taught Learner" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345726+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5J3QxgMGY8Y/Tk_VG74bN9I/AAAAAAAAAg8/ABmLvOe-Uyk/s1600/lissy-trullie-stl-2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5J3QxgMGY8Y/Tk_VG74bN9I/AAAAAAAAAg8/ABmLvOe-Uyk/s200/lissy-trullie-stl-2.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5642963173248808914" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I've listened to this EP enough times to render an opinion: despite how much we (the collective we) want &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissy_Trullie"&gt;Lissy Trullie&lt;/a&gt; to be the next &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Liz%20Phair"&gt;Lissy Phair&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramones#Visual_imagery"&gt;Lissy Ramone&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrissie_Hynde"&gt;Lissy Hynde&lt;/a&gt;, she's not quite there.  She's got the style, but not (yet) the substance.  Released in 2009, her 6 track EP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Taught_Learner"&gt;Self-Taught Learner&lt;/a&gt;" generated a lot of buzz (e.g., reviews in &lt;a href="http://hangout.altsounds.com/reviews/107160-lissy-trullie-taught-learner-ep.html"&gt;altsounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://api.wayback.archive.org/memento/20090519034740/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/lissytrullie/albums/album/26360428/review/26414693/selftaught_learner"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;), but ultimately this emperor has &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissy_Trullie#Biography"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt;, but not fully matured song-writing chops.  The neo-punk attitude's there and the production is clean enough not to inhibit mainstream appeal, but I guess there is a reason why the record labels have been riding this first release for the last two years.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The version I have was actually re-released later in 2009 on &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Downtown%20Records"&gt;Downtown Records&lt;/a&gt; and features slightly different cover art (and no, that's not Lissy on the cover) and an additional 4 songs: 2 new songs, an unreleased demo, and a phoned in version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biz_Markie"&gt;Biz Markie&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/12/freddie-scott-you-got-what-i-need-song.html"&gt;Just a Friend&lt;/a&gt;" (with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Green_%28musician%29"&gt;Adam Green&lt;/a&gt;).  If you have the 6 track version, you're fine -- the 4 new tracks don't add much.  None of the 10 songs are really bad, but only a couple really stand out.  Here's hoping her song writing improves, she hooks up with a better partner, or does more inspired covers like her version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Chip"&gt;Hot Chip&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/09/hot-chip-ready-for-floor-song-remains.html"&gt;Ready for the Floor&lt;/a&gt;".
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 5/10.  "Lissy Ramone can't take your call now, please leave a message."

    <title>Perfume Tree - "Tides' Out" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345740+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fY3mVP0YMBs/Tk10RvIp8TI/AAAAAAAAAgs/e6DcC9vykQw/s1600/perfume-tree-tides-out.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 199px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fY3mVP0YMBs/Tk10RvIp8TI/AAAAAAAAAgs/e6DcC9vykQw/s200/perfume-tree-tides-out.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5642293756224467250" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.minimum.ca/perfume_tree/"&gt;Perfume Tree&lt;/a&gt;'s 1997 EP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Perfume-Tree-Tides-Out/release/101090"&gt;Tide's Out&lt;/a&gt;" was a sign of things changing for the band.  For one, up until this point they had followed the standard formula of releasing an LP, and then a remix EP to complement that prior LP.  "Tide's Out" is not really a remix EP for 1996's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Perfume-Tree-A-Lifetime-Away/release/91288"&gt;A Lifetime Away&lt;/a&gt;" (that LP never received a remix release (edit: I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote that; 1995's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Perfume-Tree-Fathom-The-Sky/release/1751038"&gt;Fathom the Sky&lt;/a&gt;" was the remix EP for "A Lifetime Away")), but is actually a remix EP for the "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Perfume-Tree-Feeler/master/183040"&gt;Feeler&lt;/a&gt;" LP that was released in 1998.  More importantly, this EP signals an almost complete shift toward electronic music, a shift that "Feeler" would complete.  Previous releases had always retained an organic feel, but that is almost entirely gone on this release.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In my prior review of "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/12/perfume-tree-lifetime-away-lp-review.html"&gt;A Lifetime Away&lt;/a&gt;", I covered the story of Perfume Tree, their members, and their unfortunate lack of the success they deserved.  Vancouver-based radio DJs, toiling in obscurity on the small label "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/World+Domination+Recordings"&gt;World Domination Recordings&lt;/a&gt;", and prior to that the even smaller "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Zulu+Records"&gt;Zulu Records&lt;/a&gt;", their sound is as fresh today as it was in the mid-1990s.  The CDs are out of print, but most can be found used for decent $ (right now "Tide's Out" is going for &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tides-Out-Perfume-Tree/dp/B000005LB6/ref=ntt_mus_ep_dpi_3"&gt;less than $5 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I actually think the songs here are stronger than on "Feeler".  The EP features 6 tracks (~55 minutes), but really only 3 distinct songs: 2 versions of "Blink", 3 versions of "Saturate", and "Too Late, Too Early" (which would be significantly reworked as "Too Early, Too Late" on "Feeler").  "Blink" is a rather fast, up beat song compared to most by the band.  The "Black and White" version actually rocks pretty hard, complete with a hammond organ sound that the original version lacks.  All three versions of "Saturate" are good, with the "20,000 Leagues" sounding, well, like it is under water.  The "Full Steam" version is appropriately titled as well, driving almost as hard as "Blink (Black and White)".  All six tracks are amazing.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"Tide's Out", like "A Lifetime Away" the year before, showcases the band at its creative peak.  As before, the band is great, but &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jane+Tilley?anv=Jane"&gt;Jane Tilley&lt;/a&gt;'s vocals really separate the band from its peers.  No connect-the-dots, formulaic electronica here.  You owe it to yourself to hunt a copy of this EP, as well as the rest of their canon.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6eBEKO7zUs"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=639OrJsL7zU"&gt;Saturate&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://tinysong.com/IE7e"&gt;Too Late, Too Early&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWjZzihfa-I"&gt;Saturate (20,000 Leagues)&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo98dxz2vy4"&gt;Blink (Black And White)&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oih-YQF2sA"&gt;Saturate (Full Steam)&lt;/a&gt;"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10.

    <title>Ultra Orange &amp; Emmanuelle - "Ultra Orange &amp; Emmanulle" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345754+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qMa-bbuadTs/Tkwz1gkm1XI/AAAAAAAAAgk/ss7Cc2A0-qY/s1600/ultra-orange-emmanuelle.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5641941427557946738" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qMa-bbuadTs/Tkwz1gkm1XI/AAAAAAAAAgk/ss7Cc2A0-qY/s200/ultra-orange-emmanuelle.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;While watching the excellent film "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diving_Bell_and_the_Butterfly_%28film%29"&gt;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;", a great song came on that both Danette and I immediately liked but were unfamiliar with.  Watching the credits, we found that it was "Don't Kiss Me Goodbye", by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Orange_%26_Emmanuelle"&gt;Ultra Orange &amp;amp; Emmanuelle&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a now permanent collaboration of the group &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ultra+Orange"&gt;Ultra Orange&lt;/a&gt; and actress &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_Seigner"&gt;Emmanuelle Seigner&lt;/a&gt; (who also starred in "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly").   A French actress singing pop music -- you're thinking &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Bardot"&gt;Bridgette Bardot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Gainsbourg"&gt;Serge Gainsbourg&lt;/a&gt;, and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde_%28Serge_Gainsbourg_and_Brigitte_Bardot_song%29"&gt;Bonnie and Clyde&lt;/a&gt;", right? Somewhat, but in this case you need to also think David Roback &amp;amp; Kendra Smith (i.e., "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal_%28band%29"&gt;Opal&lt;/a&gt;") or David Roback &amp;amp; Hope Sandoval (i.e., "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazzy_Star"&gt;Mazzy Star&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Don't Kiss Me Goodbye" was great in the context of the movie, and I made a point to buy the LP.  Unfortunately, the LP is disappointing.  DKMG is the best song on the  LP, and on repeated listening it became apparent that why we like that  song is because we're both fans of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazzy_Star"&gt;Mazzy Star&lt;/a&gt;.   Take equal parts "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUPyqnn-eDg"&gt;Halah&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdtt5ToZt7Y"&gt;Bells Ring&lt;/a&gt;" and you have a good idea of what DKMG sounds like: fuzzy dream pop with breathy, half-spoken female vocals.  The LP cover art nicely captures the sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some songs are ok, some are really bad, but most are just very derivative and simple.  If the band down the street sounded like this, it would be ok, but the expectations are higher here.  If you don't listen too closely, they sound better: perhaps the banal lyrics would sound better in French.  The good songs are good enough to give some diversity to a playlist or mix cd, but as a collection of 11 songs this LP just doesn't hold together.  Mostly it make me appreciate &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Roback"&gt;David Roback&lt;/a&gt; more.   Emmanuelle sings better than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson#Music_career"&gt;Scarlett Johansson&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., her cover of "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/11/chris-bell-i-am-cosmos-lp-review.html"&gt;I Am the Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;") but she's clearly no &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Sandoval"&gt;Hope Sandoval&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t5JEn-TkH0"&gt;Sing Sing&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG0gptM--Po"&gt;Don't Kiss Me Goodbye&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTwjSppZC4s"&gt;movie montage&lt;/a&gt; version), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VcbnUX5ucM"&gt;Lines of My Hand&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: "Bunny", "Touch My Shadow", "Won't Lovers Revolt Now"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 4/10.  Mazzy Star keeps saying they'll &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazzy_Star#Hiatus.2C_reunion.2C_and_subsequent_work"&gt;release a fourth LP&lt;/a&gt;; in the meantime we have this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link: Bardot &amp;amp; Gainsbourg -- "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIAb9ClVoZc"&gt;Bonnie and Clyde&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>Arctic Monkeys - "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345767+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KHY4c8htan4/TkbyLeZSluI/AAAAAAAAAgc/j7eqkfiiW6g/s1600/arctic-monkeys-whatever.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KHY4c8htan4/TkbyLeZSluI/AAAAAAAAAgc/j7eqkfiiW6g/s200/arctic-monkeys-whatever.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5640461862279747298" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What's the appropriate soundtrack for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_England_riots"&gt;recent UK riots&lt;/a&gt;?  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQkActP-isE"&gt;Anarchy in the UK&lt;/a&gt;" by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Pistols"&gt;Pistols&lt;/a&gt;?  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn_8CKu9toc"&gt;London's Burning&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt;?  All good choices, but they're 1) dated and 2) rather literal.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I thought of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatever_People_Say_I_Am,_That%27s_What_I%27m_Not"&gt;Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not&lt;/a&gt;", the 2006 debut LP by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Monkeys"&gt;Arctic Monkeys&lt;/a&gt;, a colorful collection of songs that depict the bleak, feckless lives of working class youth in the UK.   For example, listen to "Riot Van", and it becomes apparent that lead singer / guitarist / song writer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Turner_%28musician%29"&gt;Alex Turner&lt;/a&gt; is writing about (and in the process, somewhat glamorizing) a general malaise, not about riots themselves.  Take  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen"&gt;Springsteen&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_%28album%29"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;", update it by an entire generation, transplant it to the UK, speed it up, and you have WPSIATWIN.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;While I had seen Arctic Monkeys on a TV show (SNL perhaps?) and enjoyed them, it took me a while to actually get this LP.  The hype machine for the band was in full swing (yet another &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop"&gt;Britpop&lt;/a&gt; band: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strokes"&gt;The Strokes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oasis_%28band%29"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), so I wasn't sure what to think.  The LP really is as good (or nearly so) as the hype: stripped down, lo-fi, catchy garage punk.  Similar to &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/The%20Cribs"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt;, and while not quite as good as them, they easily belong in the same discussion.  Although if pressed, I might admit that the lead single from the LP, "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor", rawks as hard as anything The Cribs have written. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Standout Songs:  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XTULcETGqk"&gt;I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF978AgLyaY"&gt;The View From the Afternoon&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePg1tbia9Bg"&gt;Fake Tales of San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j052-ROwPFM"&gt;Riot Van&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjzOUf0AEiQ"&gt;Perhaps Vampires Is a Bit Strong But&lt;/a&gt;..", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBbk9IjRdO0"&gt;When the Sun Goes Down&lt;/a&gt;".
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Skip'em Songs: none.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 9/10.

    <title>Husker Du - "Everything Falls Apart and More" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345781+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--u428084s1E/TkbNOt8xuhI/AAAAAAAAAgU/7FxAqRu1Cjw/s1600/husker-du-falls-apart.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5640421236064500242" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--u428084s1E/TkbNOt8xuhI/AAAAAAAAAgU/7FxAqRu1Cjw/s200/husker-du-falls-apart.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Falls_Apart"&gt;Everything Falls Apart&lt;/a&gt;" was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt;'s first studio LP, originally released in 1983 on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex_Records"&gt;Reflex Records&lt;/a&gt; and then re-released as "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/H%C3%BCsker-D%C3%BC-Everything-Falls-Apart-And-More/master/211129"&gt;Everything Falls Apart and More&lt;/a&gt;" in 1993 on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_Entertainment"&gt;Rhino Records&lt;/a&gt;.  The "and More" part refers to including Husker Du's first two 7" singles, 1980's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/H%C3%BCsker-D%C3%BC-Statues-Amusement/release/933700"&gt;Statues / Amusement&lt;/a&gt;" and 1982's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/H%C3%BCsker-D%C3%BC-In-A-Free-Land/release/1362216"&gt;In a Free Land&lt;/a&gt;", as well as two unreleased tracks a studio version of "Let's Go Die" (a live version appears on 1982's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/07/husker-du-land-speed-record-lp-review.html"&gt;Land Speed Record&lt;/a&gt;"), and the previously unreleased"Do You Remember?" (which is the English translation of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC#Formation_and_early_years"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt;").  The original LP clocked in at under 20 minutes, but the bonus material takes it to 42 minutes.  Yes, in 1982 20 minutes was considered a full length LP for punk bands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this LP sometime well after college, so it doesn't have the same nostalgia for me as "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/husker-du-flip-your-wig-lp-review.html"&gt;Flip Your Wig&lt;/a&gt;" or "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/04/husker-du-new-day-rising-lp-review.html"&gt;New Day Rising&lt;/a&gt;".  And this LP doesn't show the depth, complexity or variety that other LPs would; this is straightforward, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk"&gt;hard-core punk&lt;/a&gt;.  The production is thin &amp;amp; biting (courtesy of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_%28producer%29"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;, who produced most of the bands on the early days of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SST_Records"&gt;SST Records&lt;/a&gt;) and the songs are short, furious, and rarely last much over two minutes.  I wish I had heard this LP when it came out, it would have made a huge impression on me then. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even still, this is a surprisingly good LP to listen to today.  It is mostly angry punk music, but a few glimpses of their future, more melodic sound peek through in a few songs, like "Everything Falls Apart", "In a Free Land", and "Do You Remember?".  So while this LP stays well within its genre, it is a genre that Husker Du helped create.  Many fans think Husker Du began with "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Arcade"&gt;Zen Arcade&lt;/a&gt;", but if you're in the mood for a ferocious blast of energy, then give this LP a listen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg1PpEDfg_8"&gt;From the Gut&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxWverUGcM8"&gt;Punch Drunk&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3QQgV3KM9s"&gt;Bricklayer&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf-2eOnNl5s"&gt;Afraid of Being Wrong&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0IzyQmDkJE"&gt;Everything Falls Apart&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MUdtpT7bQw"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7RH8Hkf1PA"&gt;In a Free Land&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X-kMLWzHR8"&gt;Do You Remember?&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Songs:  their awkward cover of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan"&gt;Donovan&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Superman"&gt;Sunshine Superman&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 8/10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/HUSKERchout"&gt;HUSKERchout&lt;/a&gt; for the super-rare concert videos.</content>

Released in 1990 on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SST_Records"&gt;SST Records&lt;/a&gt; three years after &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt; had broken up, this 4-song EP is really just two earlier 7" singles combined and re-released: 1984's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/H%C3%BCsker-D%C3%BC-Eight-Miles-High/master/30062"&gt;Eight Miles High&lt;/a&gt;" and 1985's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/H%C3%BCsker-D%C3%BC-Makes-No-Sense-At-All-Love-Is-All-Around/master/30077"&gt;Makes No Sense At All&lt;/a&gt;".
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"Eight Miles High", their cover of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds"&gt;The Byrds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Miles_High"&gt;classic 1966 song&lt;/a&gt;, is a non-LP single.  Covering a song by The Byrds was quite a stretch for a punk band in 1984, and Husker Du turns out an appropriately heavy, buzz-saw version. The B-Side is a live version of "Masochism World", one of the heaviest songs on the acclaimed double LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Arcade"&gt;Zen Arcade&lt;/a&gt;".
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"Makes No Sense At All" is the best song in Husker Du's catalog, and quite possibly the best punk song ever.  It is the only single from their outstanding 1985 LP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/husker-du-flip-your-wig-lp-review.html"&gt;Flip Your Wig&lt;/a&gt;".  The B-Side is a cover of&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Curtis"&gt; Sonny Curtis&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkuEfGZffRY"&gt;Love is All Around&lt;/a&gt;".  That's right, as if to prove they could stretch &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;further&lt;/span&gt; than The Byrds, they covered the theme song for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show"&gt;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iso1cTVXh5M"&gt;opening credits&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So do you need this EP?  If you already have "Zen Arcade" and "Flip Your Wig", then there are only two new songs: "Eight Miles High" and "Love is All Around".  The latter is just a novelty, so the former is really the only new song.  If you're a hard-core fan (and don't already have the two 7" singles!), then get this EP  since it is still in print and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eight-Miles-High-Makes-Sense/dp/B000000M6I"&gt;reasonably priced&lt;/a&gt; (I think the individual singles are out of print).   But if you're not familiar with Husker Du, then start with "Flip Your Wig" and "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/04/husker-du-new-day-rising-lp-review.html"&gt;New Day Rising&lt;/a&gt;" instead.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBKyBlJ_JN8"&gt;Eight Miles High&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Kc7PKI02Lw"&gt;live 1983&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salbSLGlePM"&gt;live 1985&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeqyCwAeT3I"&gt;live 1987&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEicUhPD9xo"&gt;Masochism World (studio version)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1sYN0PuRs4"&gt;Makes No Sense At All / Love Is All Around&lt;/a&gt; (in a single video).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 6/10.  All good songs, but necessary for hard-core fans only.
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Bruce Springsteen - "For You" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345809+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qZOkitCpdUY/TjWtMxS31uI/AAAAAAAAAgE/z4eyEKrpsac/s1600/mmeb-for-you.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635600943626573538" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qZOkitCpdUY/TjWtMxS31uI/AAAAAAAAAgE/z4eyEKrpsac/s200/mmeb-for-you.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 199px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I recently reviewed "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/06/bruce-springsteen-blinded-by-light-song.html"&gt;Blinded by the Light&lt;/a&gt;", the song from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen"&gt;Bruce Springsteen&lt;/a&gt;'s first LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greetings_from_Asbury_Park,_N.J."&gt;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&lt;/a&gt;" that was made famous by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Mann%27s_Earth_Band"&gt;Manfred Mann's Earth Band&lt;/a&gt;.  For MMEB's 1980 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_%28album%29"&gt;Chance&lt;/a&gt;", they went back to the well again, recording "For You" from Bruce's 1973 debut LP.  (Bruce never released "For You" as a single, so I chose MMEB's covert art.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't recall ever hearing Bruce's version on the radio, only occasionally for the MMEB version, and nothing on classic rock radio in I don't know how many years.  Which is too bad, since this is quite a good song.  MMEB used the same formula they used on BBTL: increasing the production complexity and greatly simplifying the lyrical complexity (three stanzas to 1.5 stanzas), even to the point of removing half of the chorus.  The LP version clocked in at almost 6 minutes, but the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Manfred-Manns-Earth-Band-For-You/master/3826"&gt;7" version&lt;/a&gt; is just under 4 minutes.  Bruce's version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency&lt;br /&gt;I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long emergency&lt;br /&gt;and your cloud line urges me, and my electric surges free&lt;/blockquote&gt;MMEB's version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I came for you&lt;br /&gt;I came for you&lt;br /&gt;I came for you&lt;br /&gt;For you&lt;br /&gt;I came for you &lt;/blockquote&gt;Eliminating the urgency/emergency portion significantly changes the meaning of the song; explore the &lt;a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/for-you"&gt;original version&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858715086/"&gt;MMEB version&lt;/a&gt; for additional changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For You: Bruce Springsteen (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0JOOEnRopM"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHOjZjKfjfI"&gt;1978 live version&lt;/a&gt;), Manfred Mann's Earth Band (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfnQ1iv_lGo"&gt;7" single version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tinysong.com/IaeW"&gt;LP version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjsFAg3RMhk"&gt;1986 live version&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for completeness, I suppose I should mention the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Disco-Boys-For-You/master/3777"&gt;2005 release&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disco_Boys"&gt;The Disco Boys&lt;/a&gt;, based on the MMEB version: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ZCAVg0Rw"&gt;Radio Edit version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j9m3bSiS3A"&gt;Freemasons Remix version&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Cowboy Junkies - "The Trinity Session" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345823+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tC8U3kot4BA/TjRiTQYHiyI/AAAAAAAAAf8/dZEyipN3CDY/s1600/cowboy-junkies-trinity-session.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tC8U3kot4BA/TjRiTQYHiyI/AAAAAAAAAf8/dZEyipN3CDY/s200/cowboy-junkies-trinity-session.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635237116700494626" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was recently extolling the virtues of this LP to Herbert, and I've given/recommended it as a gift several times before so I decided I should go ahead and review it.  Simply put, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Junkies"&gt;Cowboy Junkies&lt;/a&gt; 1988 sophomore LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trinity_Session"&gt;The Trinity Session&lt;/a&gt;", is one of the best LPs of all time.  The story of the actual recording session is now legendary: on a shoestring budget, the group rented the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Trinity,_Toronto"&gt;Church of the Holy Trinity&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto (they're Canadian) for one day and recorded the entire LP live with one mic (ok, technically they forgot to record the a capella "Mining for Gold" during the weekend and recorded it a few days later in the church during the lunch break of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's recording session).  The warm acoustics of the church, the intimate, spare production, the lonely, hazy songs -- it all combines to transport you to the session itself, like you helped the band move their gear and watched and listened to the LP unfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what is less well-known but more interesting to me is that this LP is a love letter to &amp;amp; reinterpretation of country music.  On the &lt;a href="http://www.cowboyjunkies.com/"&gt;band's website&lt;/a&gt; they have &lt;a href="http://www.cowboyjunkies.com/albums/trinitysession/index2.html"&gt;extensive notes&lt;/a&gt; about their experiences touring the American South in support of their previous LP and being introduced to country music:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e had spent a lot of time in the Southern States, especially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. ... Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town, so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters, fans, waitresses and bartenders. One of the best part about being "billeted" was that each night we were exposed to a new record collection and each night we'd discover a new album or a new band or a whole new type of music that was springing up in some buried underground scene somewhere in America.  ...  A style of music that we were heavily exposed to at that time was country music. It wasn't like everyone we ran into was a country music freak, but growing up in the South, most people had been exposed to a lot more of it than we had growing up in suburban Montreal. There would inevitably be in every collection one or two great country music records that had been lifted from their parents as they moved out. Sitting there between the latest &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Piggy"&gt;Death Piggy&lt;/a&gt; single and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane"&gt;Coltrane&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps"&gt;Giant Steps&lt;/a&gt; would be something like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waylon_Jennings"&gt;Waylon Jennings&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honky_Tonk_Heroes"&gt;Honky Tonk Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Cline"&gt;Patsy Cline&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Greatest_Hits"&gt;Greatest Hits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Louvin_Brothers"&gt;The &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Louvin_Brothers"&gt;Louvin Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Family"&gt;The Carter Family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Monroe"&gt;Bill Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams"&gt;Hank Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson"&gt;Willie Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Haggard"&gt;Merle Haggard&lt;/a&gt; and the list goes on. We drank it up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sometimes you don't really understand something that you take for granted until it is processed and presented to you by someone from another culture or background (cf. my discussion of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Robertson"&gt;Robbie Robertson'&lt;/a&gt;s "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/band-night-they-drove-old-dixie-down.html"&gt;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&lt;/a&gt;").  In doing so, the Junkies helped revitalize/define the genre of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-country"&gt;alt country&lt;/a&gt;, infused from their lo-fi, hazy, barroom blues sound from their first LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whites_Off_Earth_Now%21%21"&gt;Whites Off Earth Now!!&lt;/a&gt;" (see also: "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2011/02/gil-scott-heron-me-and-devil-song.html"&gt;Me and the Devil Blues&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this LP, the CJs don't simply cover country songs, but reinterpret them, and let the attitude infuse their other songs as well.  For example, they do a slow, aching version of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_So_Lonesome_I_Could_Cry"&gt;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&lt;/a&gt;" that I think Hank Williams would approve of.  Ditto a six minute blues jam version of Patsy Cline's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkin%27_After_Midnight"&gt;Walkin' After Midnight&lt;/a&gt;".  They also strip down "Dreaming My Dreams With You" by Waylon Jennings, and do a surprisingly upbeat version (for them) of the traditional song "Working On a Building".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go beyond straight covers with their version of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Moon_%28song%29"&gt;Blue Moon&lt;/a&gt;", mixing an original song with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rodgers"&gt;Rodgers&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_Hart"&gt;Hart&lt;/a&gt; standard to yield "Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)".  The result is genius; acknowledging the presence of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley"&gt;Elvis&lt;/a&gt; without overshadowing the rest of the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my high praise for the above songs, the star of the show is without question their rolling, relaxed cover of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground"&gt;The Velvet Underground&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Jane"&gt;Sweet Jane&lt;/a&gt;". One doesn't normally associate the Velvets with, say, Patsy Cline or Hank Williams, but the CJs figured out how to make it work.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed"&gt;Lou Reed&lt;/a&gt; himself has said that the Cowboy Junkies version of "Sweet Jane" is "&lt;a href="http://www.artistwd.com/joyzine/music/cowboy_junkies/cowboy.php"&gt;the best and most authentic version I have ever heard&lt;/a&gt;" -- you're not going to find higher praise than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I've spoken mostly of their covers, the LP features a handful of originals like "Misguided Angel" (a disturbingly beautiful song about an abusive relationship) and "200 More Miles" (a road song that appropriately namechecks Willie Nelson) that are excellent songs worthy of their placement in the LP.  There are a few of missteps on the LP, for example Jeff Bird's harmonica on "I Don't Get It" and "Postcard Blues" is a little too shrill for my tastes, but these flaws are easily forgiven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conventional wisdom on the Cowboy Junkies is that "The Trinity Session" was their creative high point.  I have most of their other LPs and I would agree that this is their best (though the others are quite good), but whereas many other critics blame them from not deviating from the formula they introduced on this LP, I think their fortunes waned when their sound became more polished and mainstream.  I don't normally wish for bands to miss out on financial and critical success, but I kind of wish that it had avoided the CJs for a while longer and they could have made a few more LPs like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUhaq4Yg74w"&gt;Mining for Gold&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zufpr8BwY9U"&gt;Misguided Angel&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ6EGsZdxpE"&gt;Blue Moon Revisited (Song for Elvis)&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObnuraMv4EU"&gt;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SwJM5yohb0"&gt;200 More Miles&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHRFZFmEq9o"&gt;Sweet Jane&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lPyHd1_aXU"&gt;Walkin' After Midnight&lt;/a&gt;".  (The entire LP at &lt;a href="http://grooveshark.com/#/album/The+Trinity+Session/180111"&gt;grooveshark.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Songs: n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10.  Perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elvis Presley - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tNnulRuMGU"&gt;Blue Moon&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;The Velvet Underground - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgUs7yWnDJ8"&gt;Sweet Jane&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Patsy Cline - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsRNCvHXHHU"&gt;Walking After Midnight&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Waylon Jennings - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqtJhSH5zWA"&gt;Dreaming My Dreams With You&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Bill Monroe &amp;amp; The Bluegrass Boys - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBDZ3G4RCHc"&gt;Working on a Building&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;Hank Williams - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvW6_-TP5cs"&gt;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=";font-family:Verdana,Arial,Helvetica;font-size:85%;"  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Julee Cruise - "Floating Into the Night" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345837+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8qrigtsG3W8/TissYDPgD3I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/_0pV_tWQzxU/s1600/Jc_float.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8qrigtsG3W8/TissYDPgD3I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/_0pV_tWQzxU/s200/Jc_float.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5632644550655741810" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To most people, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julee_Cruise"&gt;Julee Cruise&lt;/a&gt; will remind them of the TV series "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt;", but I didn't watch much TV in college when the series was on.  But this music does remind me of my senior year of college, when I and my roommates Terry, Jason, and Frey would stay up all hours of the night drinking beer and playing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spades"&gt;Spades&lt;/a&gt;.  It didn't do much for our studies, but we became expert at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts#Shooting_the_moon"&gt;shooting the moon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spades#Bidding"&gt;going under&lt;/a&gt; with almost any hand.  Of course we'd listen to music as we played, and this LP was a constant favorite for all four of us.  Individually we all had substantial CD collections and together we had maybe 15 linear feet of CDs, which was quite a lot at the time.  I'm not sure who had this CD (Jason?), but I quickly purchased my copy after moving out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_into_the_Night"&gt;Floating Into the Night&lt;/a&gt;" is one of the best LPs of all time, featuring the perfect collaboration between Julee Cruise (vocals), &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Badalamenti"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Badalamenti"&gt;ngelo Badalamenti&lt;/a&gt; (composer), and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch"&gt;David Lynch&lt;/a&gt; (lyricist).  Badalamenti has composed many soundtracks for Lynch, and the collaboration with Cruise actually began with the song "Mysteries of Love" for the film "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Velvet_%28film%29"&gt;Blue Velvet&lt;/a&gt;".  That song lead to them recording a full LP's worth of songs, culminating in the 1989 release of "Floating Into the Night", prior to the release of Twin Peaks (90-91).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're familiar with Lynch's films, you know that they are surreal, dream-like, and often deal with dark, disturbing themes and images.  Badalamenti's dream/lounge arrangements perfectly complement Lynch's imagery but the real surprise is Lynch's lyrics, which depict scenes which are best described as bittersweet, bucolic, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell"&gt;Rockwellian&lt;/a&gt;, nostalgic, and child-like.  The lyrics juxtaposed with the foreboding soundscapes makes the entire experience that much more powerful.  Consider the closing lyrics to "Rocking Back Inside My Heart":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Do you remember our picnic lunch?                                                                                    &lt;br /&gt;We both went up to the lake                                                                                          &lt;br /&gt;And then we walked among the pines&lt;br /&gt;The birds sang out a song for us                                                                                     &lt;br /&gt;We had a fire when we came back                                                                                      &lt;br /&gt;And your smile was beautiful                                                                                         &lt;br /&gt;You touched my cheek and you kissed me                                                                               &lt;br /&gt;At night we went for a stroll                                                                                        &lt;br /&gt;The wind blew our hair                                                                                               &lt;br /&gt;The fire made us warm                                                                                                &lt;br /&gt;The wind blew the waves                                                                                              &lt;br /&gt;Out on the lake                                                                                                      &lt;br /&gt;We heard the owl in a nearby tree.                                                                                   &lt;br /&gt;I thought our love would last forever.        &lt;/blockquote&gt;Simple enough, but when combined with the music they become quite unsettling in an unexpected way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the possible exception of "Swans", all the songs on this LP are perfect, memorable, and distinct: the horn riff on "Floating", the bass on "Falling", the 50s-era "shu bops" at the end of "I Remember", the swing sound of "Rockin' Back Inside My Heart", sweeping sounds of "Mysteries of Love", the musical surprise at ~3:28 of "Into the Night", the horns of "I Float Alone", the vocals of "The Nightingale", the solemnity of "The World Spins".  "Swans" is not bad, but at 2:33 it does not add much to the LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cruise, Badalamenti, and Lynch would all work together again on 1993's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_of_Love"&gt;The Voice of Love&lt;/a&gt;", and while that is not a bad LP it does not come close to capturing the magic of "Floating Into The Night".  Danette says I'm too generous with my perfect scores, but this LP clearly deserves it.  Whether it is evokes late nights playing cards, Twin Peaks, or simply nostalgia viewed through the twisted prism of David Lynch, once you've listened to it this LP is not easily forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "Floating", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBdH6SjBEX8"&gt;Falling&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3y0tepCJME"&gt;I Remember&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxGtQQhV4xM"&gt;Rockin' Back Inside My Heart&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmJzy0WrSXY"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBoXNket2pQ"&gt;Mysteries of Love&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/4304292/julee_cruise_into_the_night_original_video_stereo/"&gt;Into the Night&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/16176878"&gt;I Float Alone&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_rlzdt6mJ4"&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F-aDwgrHBE"&gt;The World Spins&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqiW3PgsedM"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;).  (You can also find the entire LP listed at &lt;a href="http://grooveshark.com/#/album/Floating+Into+The+Night/221442"&gt;Grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;.)  (Some of the live versions are from the concert film "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Symphony_No._1"&gt;Industrial Sympony No. 1&lt;/a&gt;".)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 10/10.</content>

    <title>Red House Painters - Red House Painters (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345851+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h_OjBxLrB9k/TgPH4aPf45I/AAAAAAAAAdc/WRfGJ3Cmgfw/s1600/RHP-Rollercoaster.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5621556531819438994" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h_OjBxLrB9k/TgPH4aPf45I/AAAAAAAAAdc/WRfGJ3Cmgfw/s200/RHP-Rollercoaster.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 196px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What if you combined elements of 1980s goth/punk (e.g., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure"&gt;The Cure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain"&gt;The Jesus and Mary Chain&lt;/a&gt;), alt-country (e.g., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Junkies"&gt;Cowboy Junkies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_3"&gt;Mojave 3&lt;/a&gt;), and slowcore (e.g., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_%28band%29"&gt;Low&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine_%28band%29"&gt;Codeine&lt;/a&gt;), and the result  was...&amp;nbsp; boring?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_House_Painters"&gt;Red House Painters&lt;/a&gt;, at least as I listen to their 1993 eponymous LP informally known as "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_House_Painters_%28Rollercoaster%29"&gt;Rollercoaster&lt;/a&gt;" (to differentiate it from their other 1993 eponymous LP known as "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_House_Painters_%28Bridge%29"&gt;Bridge&lt;/a&gt;").  I generally like to become very familiar with an LP before I review it, but I actually haven't had this LP long.  I read an effusive review somewhere online (&lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/r170217"&gt;Allmusic&lt;/a&gt; perhaps?) and purchased it without a lot of other research.  Having just listened to it again tonight, the best thing I can say is there are no bad songs.  Unfortunately, there are no good songs either.  Just 14 unremarkable songs that evoke all of the influences listed above, but otherwise do nothing for me... and I really &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; this genre!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I would have felt differently in 1993, or maybe if I gave it a few more listens, but I feel I've listened to it enough to render an opinion:  there were many LPs released in 1993 and this is one of them.  It reminds of Roosevelt's quote about "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic"&gt;those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Songs that appear: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o81keEwGQxc"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxyKqH2E4sM"&gt;Strawberry Hill&lt;/a&gt;", (find more at &lt;a href="http://grooveshark.com/#/artist/Red+House+Painters/3807"&gt;Grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 5/10.  Suitable for background listening only.</content>

    <title>Bruce Springsteen - "Blinded by the Light" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345864+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a6wqSaK3030/Tf7FbU2vKvI/AAAAAAAAAdU/vADSG1gOFtI/s1600/blinded-by-the-light.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5620146458250390258" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a6wqSaK3030/Tf7FbU2vKvI/AAAAAAAAAdU/vADSG1gOFtI/s200/blinded-by-the-light.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 196px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How should I observe the passing of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Clemons"&gt;Clarence Clemons&lt;/a&gt;?  An obvious choice would be "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungleland"&gt;Jungleland&lt;/a&gt;", which is often cited as having one of &lt;a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/music/866815-clarence-clemons-best-saxophone-solos-from-jungleland-to-born-to-run"&gt;Clemons' best solos&lt;/a&gt; (it occurs ~ 4:03 in this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH_NvYPBDY0"&gt;live 1978 version&lt;/a&gt;).  Instead, I'm going with a song most people probably don't know was written by Bruce: "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_by_the_Light"&gt;Blinded by the Light&lt;/a&gt;", the first (and ultimately unsuccessful) single  from Bruce's first LP, 1973's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greetings_from_Asbury_Park,_N.J."&gt;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Blinded by the Light" was later made famous by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Mann%27s_Earth_Band"&gt;Manfred Mann's Earth Band&lt;/a&gt; as a single from their 1976 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roaring_Silence"&gt;The Roaring Silence&lt;/a&gt;".  Whereas Bruce's version was still very much in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan"&gt;Dylan&lt;/a&gt;'s shadow, MMEB trimmed the voluminous lyrics (&lt;a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/blinded-by-the-light"&gt;original lyrics&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/48893/"&gt;MMEB's lyrics&lt;/a&gt;), provided a slick 70s synth sound, and added some clever counterpoint at the end.  The Manfred Mann version came in two versions, both of which you still  hear regularly on classic rock radio: a 7 minute LP version and a 4  minute single version.  And while it very much sounds like a mid-70s  song, I never tire of it (see also: "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/07/nick-lowe-cruel-to-be-kind-forgotten.html"&gt;Cruel to be Kind&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The various characters in the song (the drummer, diplomat, mascot, preacher, chaperone, etc.) are partially explained in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1_Storytellers_%28Bruce_Springsteen%29"&gt;VH1 Storytellers DVD&lt;/a&gt;, but the interesting explanation is cut short by the video's editors! Danette bought this as a Christmas present a few years ago precisely because she knows I'm fascinated by this song's cast of characters and she thought all would finally be explained.  Unless someone has an unedited version of this performance we'll never know who all these people are (though it is clear they are all real, or at least based on real characters).  I've seen various explanations on the web, but none that I'd consider canonical.  And if you're only familiar with the MMEB's version, you're missing out  on the those that MMEB removed: the "hazard from Harvard", the "dude" from Scotland Yard, the shooting star, and the  avatar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While "Blinded by the Light" is probably not the first song you think of when Clarence Clemons is mentioned, I will point out that it is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greetings_from_Asbury_Park,_N.J.#song-by-song_musician_credits"&gt;one of only two GFAPNJ songs&lt;/a&gt; on which Clemons appears and as such I consider it a fitting tribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce Springsteen: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjxbOe7p8C0"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzmCorgkPU"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUO0IUwfLvI"&gt;1974 live version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNN_bPJ4Ubo"&gt;2009 live version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/177957/storytellers-devils-and-dust-and-blinded-by-the-light.jhtml"&gt;VH1 Storytellers version&lt;/a&gt; (starts at ~9:00 into the video).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manfred Mann's Earth Band: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlBifX0H3yg"&gt;LP version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.totallyfuzzy.net/ourtube/manfred-manns-earth-band/blinded-by-the-light-video_5944ddf36.html"&gt;Single version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcWVL4B-4pI"&gt;1975 live version&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>The Shelia Divine - "Hum" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345878+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ABKi2IecPC0/TeWxC8JgpHI/AAAAAAAAAdA/WNzZ914DRIg/s1600/sheila-divine-hum.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ABKi2IecPC0/TeWxC8JgpHI/AAAAAAAAAdA/WNzZ914DRIg/s200/sheila-divine-hum.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5613087174651061362" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was driving in the &lt;a href="http://www.cs.odu.edu/%7Emln/galaxie/"&gt;convertible&lt;/a&gt; tonight, listening to a mix CD (ca. 2002) I keep in the car that I hadn't played in quite a while.  Of course, it is entirely sing-along, road-trip music: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliana_Hatfield"&gt;Juliana Hatfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/Weezer"&gt;Weezer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smithereens"&gt;The Smithereens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck"&gt;Beck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Francis"&gt;Frank Black&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  On came a song that I had entirely forgotten about: "Hum", a single from the 1999 LP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Sheila-Divine-New-Parade/release/701144"&gt;New Parade&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheila_Divine"&gt;The Sheila Divine&lt;/a&gt;.  Clearly it's a great song or it would not have made the road trip CD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TSD were a 90s alternative band based in Boston that generated a buzz on college radio, but never quite turned the corner to mainstream success (or even sustained alternative success, for that matter).  After 2 more LPs, they eventually broke up in 2003, but reformed in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned of them from "Hum", which received a bit of radio airplay in 1999.  I bought "New Parade", but as I recall the rest of the LP did not measure up to the strong hooks of "Hum".  I suppose I should give it a listen again (it has been a long time), but in the mean time see if you recall this excellent song.  Sure, it sounds like most other 90s alternative bands (expertly working the soft-loud-soft formula in a way that would make the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies"&gt;Pixies&lt;/a&gt; proud), but that's alright by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hum: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4TRD-Vc9vU"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob-vjdih2lM"&gt;2001 live version&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Pink Floyd - "When the Tigers Broke Free" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345892+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pM9LS3z6EvI/TdpjL7f7LII/AAAAAAAAAc4/Odndw8ukzfI/s1600/pink-floyd-music-from-the-film.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pM9LS3z6EvI/TdpjL7f7LII/AAAAAAAAAc4/Odndw8ukzfI/s200/pink-floyd-music-from-the-film.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5609905342444678274" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'll just assume that everyone has seen &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd_The_Wall_%28film%29"&gt;The Wall&lt;/a&gt; at least a dozen times and spare you the exposition on the cultural impact of the LP and film.  I'll remind you that most of the songs on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_%28Pink_Floyd%29"&gt;1979 LP&lt;/a&gt; and the 1982 film are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd_The_Wall_%28film%29#Soundtrack"&gt;slightly different&lt;/a&gt;, with many versions re-recorded, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Geldof"&gt;Bob Geldof&lt;/a&gt; (who played &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd_%28fictional_character%29"&gt;Pink&lt;/a&gt; in the film) singing lead on some, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do you remember "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Tigers_Broke_Free"&gt;When the Tigers Broke Free&lt;/a&gt;", the only non-LP song in the film?  It is split in two parts and interpolates "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Brick_in_the_Wall"&gt;Another Brick in the Wall Part 1&lt;/a&gt;".  The death of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters"&gt;Roger Waters&lt;/a&gt;' father in WWII  and his subsequent absence during his youth influences a lot of Waters' music, but this song is the most detailed and provides significant historical detail.  For example, we can deduce that his father died in Italy during &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Shingle"&gt;Operation Shingle&lt;/a&gt;.  I don't often reproduce &lt;a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/2932/"&gt;entire lyrics&lt;/a&gt;, but in this case they succinctly motivate the entire franchise that is "The Wall":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It was just before dawn&lt;br /&gt;One miserable morning in black 'forty four.&lt;br /&gt;When the forward commander&lt;br /&gt;Was told to sit tight&lt;br /&gt;When he asked that his men be withdrawn.&lt;br /&gt;And the Generals gave thanks&lt;br /&gt;As the other ranks held back&lt;br /&gt;The enemy tanks for a while.&lt;br /&gt;And the Anzio bridgehead&lt;br /&gt;Was held for the price&lt;br /&gt;Of a few hundred ordinary lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And kind old King George&lt;br /&gt;Sent Mother a note&lt;br /&gt;When he heard that father was gone.&lt;br /&gt;It was, as I recall,&lt;br /&gt;In a form of a scroll,&lt;br /&gt;With gold leaf and all.&lt;br /&gt;And I found it one day&lt;br /&gt;In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away.&lt;br /&gt;And my eyes still grow damp to remember&lt;br /&gt;His Majesty signed&lt;br /&gt;With his own rubber stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was dark all around.&lt;br /&gt;There was frost in the ground&lt;br /&gt;When the tigers broke free.&lt;br /&gt;And no one survived&lt;br /&gt;From the Royal Fusiliers Company C.&lt;br /&gt;They were all left behind,&lt;br /&gt;Most of them dead,&lt;br /&gt;The rest of them dying.&lt;br /&gt;And that's how the High Command&lt;br /&gt;Took my daddy from me.                  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTTBF was released as 7" single entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Pink-Floyd-The-Wall-Music-From-The-Film/master/44270"&gt;The Wall -- Music From The Film&lt;/a&gt;".  As the name suggests, the single was supposed to be from a soundtrack LP for the film, to complement the 1979 LP.  That soundtrack LP never materialized, but instead morphed into the 1982 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Cut_%28album%29"&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/a&gt;" (which did not contain WTTBF), the LP that pretty much &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd#Waters-led_era_.281981-84.29"&gt;ended Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt; as we knew it.   The 7" single was the only release for the song until the 2001 greatest hits compilation "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echoes:_The_Best_of_Pink_Floyd"&gt;Echoes&lt;/a&gt;" and then the 2004 re-release of "The Final Cut".  Despite these belated re-releases, I'm guessing that most of us have only heard the song in the context of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While musically simple, it is a good song and suits the storyline of the movie/LP well.  It also hints at the direction that the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters#Solo_career_.281984.E2.80.93present.29"&gt;solo work&lt;/a&gt; by Roger Waters would take in the mid-80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Tigers Broke Free: (parts 1 and 2 from the film, spliced together): &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKfwwlEcowk"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Tigers Broke Free, the B-side alternate version of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_the_Boys_Back_Home"&gt;Bring the Boys Back Home&lt;/a&gt;": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9b9UhFe6Eg"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.B. In case you did not know, a "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;" was a formidable German tank from WWII.</content>

    <title>K's Choice - "Not An Addict" (forgotten song)</title>

I remember when I first heard the song, I thought it was a new Indigo Girls song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K's Choice hails from Belgium and scored a good amount of radio airplay in the US with their 1995 single "Not An Addict", from their second LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_in_Me"&gt;Paradise in Me&lt;/a&gt;".  Although they continued off and on since then with occasional hiatus and solo project, to my knowledge "Not An Addict" was the only radio play they received here.  &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Ks-Choice-Not-An-Addict/master/117518"&gt;Discogs&lt;/a&gt; shows several different mixes and running lengths depending on the country where it was released.   The link below is marked "European Version", but this is the version I recall hearing on the radio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although its sound is very much of its time (note the similarities to contemporaries like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins"&gt;Smashing Pumpkins&lt;/a&gt; (the guitars in "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHUd896Sur0"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;") and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Chains"&gt;Alice in Chains&lt;/a&gt; (the drums in "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nco_kh8xJDs"&gt;Would?&lt;/a&gt;")), this song still rawks in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not An Addict: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cklb7L0OA1c"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. A surprisingly good audience recording (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVcys0IKcE4"&gt;05/16/10&lt;/a&gt;).</content>

    <title>Liz Phair - "whitechocolatespaceegg" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345919+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iqSRNH46xPY/TZKIGFj4hTI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/nrTPxpOJ8mk/s1600/whitechocolatespaceegg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iqSRNH46xPY/TZKIGFj4hTI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/nrTPxpOJ8mk/s200/whitechocolatespaceegg.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5589679725673481522" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When I last talked about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Phair"&gt;Liz Phair&lt;/a&gt;, I was kicking around her 2003 &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/07/liz-phair-liz-phair-lp-review.html"&gt;self-titled LP&lt;/a&gt;, which is so universally reviled that it was a pretty cheap shot on my part.  To make it more interesting -- and roughly working backwards through her discography -- I'd like to discuss her often overlooked third LP, 1998's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitechocolatespaceegg"&gt;whitechocolatespaceegg&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This LP is frequently considered the beginning of the end -- it did not attract the commercial or critical attention that her two previous LPs did.  Interestingly, whereas they featured numerous  (re-recorded) songs from her &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girly_Sound"&gt;Girlysound&lt;/a&gt; demo tapes, this LP features only two: "Shitloads of Money" and "Polyester Bride".  Not coincidentally, they are two of the best songs on whitechocolatespaceegg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was Liz running out of ideas?  As a thirty-something, was she no longer able to crank out the angst-filled anthems that came so easy when she was a twenty-something, no longer channeling her inner &lt;a href="http://jakefogelnest.com/post/3129426421"&gt;Corey Flood&lt;/a&gt;?  Or, more likely, she had fallen to the bane of all female rockers: marriage &amp;amp; children.  Seriously, that's when Pat Benatar &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropico_%28album%29"&gt;lost her edge too&lt;/a&gt;.   In fact, the title "whitechocolatespaceegg" is in reference to her child's head crowning during birth.  Corey Flood would never use that as the &lt;a href="http://www.looptvandfilm.com/blog/joelies.jpg"&gt;title for her LP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason, the song quality on this LP varies greatly.  The best songs are as good as any of her earlier material, including the new material: "Girls' Room" (which perfectly captures the politics of middle school girls), "whitechocolatespaceegg" (a nice plodding song that sounds like Liz Phair meets &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt;) , "Big Tall Man", "Perfect World" (how did this song not end up on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City"&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/a&gt;?), "Johnny Feelgood",  and "Uncle Alvarez".  Only one song is really bad: "Baby Got Going" (her &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiffle"&gt;skiffle&lt;/a&gt; tribute).  The rest of the seven songs are slightly boring and fail to engage, shock, or find a clever or catchy phrase / chorus.  Liz (I pretend I'm on a first-name basis with her) has never been about technical proficiency; instead she writes terribly clever songs and packs them with attitude.  If one or both are missing, they just don't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, "Perfect World" sets the bar pretty high:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanna be cool, tall, vulnerable and luscious&lt;br /&gt;I would have it all if I'd only had this much&lt;br /&gt;No need for Lucifer to fall, if he'd learn to keep his mouth shut&lt;br /&gt;I would be involved, be involved&lt;br /&gt;Be involved, be involved, I would be involved with you&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;She also nails it in "Girls' Room":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Here comes Tiffany, my best friend Tiffany&lt;br /&gt;Wearing a size-too-small sweater&lt;br /&gt;Me and Tiffany, dressing up pretty&lt;br /&gt;We love to ride, we love to canter&lt;br /&gt;My best friend Tiffany, she is so popular&lt;br /&gt;We're going from site-to-site and pool-to-pool tonight&lt;br /&gt;And we hear Terri say that Trisha's okay&lt;br /&gt;But she ought to learn to shave her bikini line better&lt;br /&gt;And Tauren was born, like her mother, in a storm&lt;br /&gt;And Tracy's been away forever&lt;/blockquote&gt;In fairness, some of the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitechocolatespaceegg#Outtakes"&gt;rejected mixes&lt;/a&gt;" are better than the more "radio friendly" versions that appear on the LP (this is also where the record labels start meddling with her LPs).  For example, the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiLzw6icUXM"&gt;rejected mix of "What Makes You Happy"&lt;/a&gt; is much better than the LP version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while some of the songs are great, as good as the material on her celebrated earlier releases in fact, whitechocolatespaceegg never quite comes together as a solid collection.  It would have worked much better as a 30 minute EP (easily scoring a 9/10) rather than a 50 minute LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltveb6XvHbc"&gt;Shitloads of Money&lt;/a&gt;", "Polyester Bride" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z36Z0Fo-7zQ"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CztbGlpPizs"&gt;2003 live, solo version&lt;/a&gt;), " Girls' Room" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugrC7Q0R4k8"&gt;2010 live version&lt;/a&gt;),  "whitechocolatespaceegg", "Big Tall Man", "Perfect World" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyIUU8dzxB0"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFZ1fSddRQQ"&gt;1999 live version&lt;/a&gt;), "Johnny Feelgood" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHrekB-Pp_o"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqoQK5NgIQ"&gt;2010 live version&lt;/a&gt;), and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utiquyN-Zz4"&gt;Uncle Alvarez&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NY8H2Qe3YI"&gt;Baby Got Going&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 6/10.  Good, but not essential for casual fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMZl6X9B1TM"&gt;Liz in the studio&lt;/a&gt;, working on the LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I will eventually get to her first two LPs.</content>

    <title>Gil Scott-Heron - "Me and the Devil" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345933+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-97BLYAI_03s/TVdNqWqE0yI/AAAAAAAAAb8/y8z-i3n8I0w/s1600/gil-scott-heron-me-and-the-devil.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-97BLYAI_03s/TVdNqWqE0yI/AAAAAAAAAb8/y8z-i3n8I0w/s200/gil-scott-heron-me-and-the-devil.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5573008453926179618" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I didn't know that much about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Scott-Heron"&gt;Gil Scott-Heron&lt;/a&gt;; sure I knew some of his more famous spoken word stuff, like "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS3QOtbW4m0"&gt;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&lt;/a&gt;" &amp;amp; "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5smPcN8AoE"&gt;Whitey On The Moon&lt;/a&gt;", but I didn't realize he was a legitimate singer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbert recently turned me on to GSH's 2010 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_New_Here"&gt;I'm New Here&lt;/a&gt;", which is a mix of songs and spoken word tracks.  I'll review the LP later, but the center piece of the LP is GSH's version of the 1937 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Johnson_%28musician%29"&gt;Robert Johnson&lt;/a&gt; classic "&lt;a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/%7Emusic/blues/matdb.html"&gt;Me and the Devil Blues&lt;/a&gt;" (the title here is reduced to just "Me and the Devil").  Musically, instead of a standard blues arrangement, it is given the doom stomp treatment that reminds me of Johnny Cash's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/05/johnny-cash-gods-gonna-cut-you-down_15.html"&gt;God's Gonna Cut You Down&lt;/a&gt;", albeit with more of a synth/electronic sound.  Vocally, GSH's leathery voice compares favorably with Robert Johnson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you surely know, this is Johnson's second song dealing with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust"&gt;Faustian&lt;/a&gt; themes, the other being "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Road_Blues"&gt;Cross Road Blues&lt;/a&gt;", which is generally associated with him &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Johnson_%28musician%29#Devil_legend"&gt;selling his soul&lt;/a&gt; for his guitar proficiency (of course, this is a great theme for musicians; see also: the 1986 film "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossroads_%281986_film%29"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Paganini#Dramatic_portrayals"&gt;Paganini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Tartini#Fictional_portrayal"&gt;Tartini&lt;/a&gt;, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been countless covers of Johnson's song...  Two more notable versions are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton"&gt;Eric Clapton&lt;/a&gt;'s, from his 2004 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_and_Mr._Johnson"&gt;Me and Mr. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;" and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Junkies"&gt;Cowboy Junkies&lt;/a&gt; from their 1986 debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whites_Off_Earth_Now%21%21"&gt;Whites Off Earth Now!!&lt;/a&gt;".  I'm a big Cowboy Junkies fan (even though this is their first mention here), but I think Gil Scott-Heron might have done a better version of this song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gil Scott-Heron: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OET8SVAGELA"&gt;Me and the Devil&lt;/a&gt;" (the official video incorporates ~1:45 of  GSH's "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sESkfMfqEeQ"&gt;Your Soul and Mine&lt;/a&gt;" from "I'm New Here")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Johnson: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MCHI23FTP8"&gt;Me and the Devil Blues&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Clapton: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdMEI9nnnVU"&gt;Me and the Devil Blues&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowboy Junkies: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLsQ08k1lAA"&gt;Me and the Devil Blues&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>Air - "Cherry Blossom Girl" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345947+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TU9SceSIJKI/AAAAAAAAAbw/Sr53EsUDcbk/s1600/air-cherry-blossom-girl.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TU9SceSIJKI/AAAAAAAAAbw/Sr53EsUDcbk/s200/air-cherry-blossom-girl.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5570761913199502498" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I hadn't planned to review this, but it came up in my iTunes playlist today...  I really like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_%28French_band%29"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; and I absolutely love &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Sandoval"&gt;Hope Sandoval&lt;/a&gt;, so the combination of the two can't go wrong, right? Well, that's pretty much true.  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Blossom_Girl"&gt;Cherry Blossom Girl&lt;/a&gt;" is a single from Air's 2004 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkie_Walkie"&gt;Talkie Walkie&lt;/a&gt;", one of the few Air LPs I don't have.  But as much as I like Air, I bought this single because of their collaboration with Hope Sandoval. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/AIR-Cherry-Blossom-Girl/release/238068"&gt;CD single&lt;/a&gt; released on &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Astralwerks"&gt;Astralwerks&lt;/a&gt; has four versions of the "Cherry Blossom Girl": a "radio mix" by Air, a version with Hope Sandoval, a mix by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_Mobile_Disco"&gt;Simian Mobile Disco&lt;/a&gt;, and a demo version by Air. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure what differentiates the radio mix from the LP version, but it is a typically good song by Air: smooth, airy, non-offensive, pop electronica.  The version with Hope Sandoval is different enough to be an entirely different song: all the electronics are stripped out and Hope turns in a typical quiet, dreamy, breathy performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Simian Mobile Disco version is entirely skippable.  I really like nearly all the acts on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_Recordings"&gt;Wichita Recordings&lt;/a&gt;, but SMD is one of their biggest artists, along with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Party"&gt;Bloc Party&lt;/a&gt;, and I just haven't liked anything I've heard from either of them.  As far as the demo version... it is interesting to compare it with the final version, but it is skippable too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, whether or not you need this single depends on if you are a Hope Sandoval &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Hope+Sandoval#t=Credits_Vocals&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;p=1"&gt;completist&lt;/a&gt;.  Obviously, I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK54-GizXmA"&gt;radio mix by Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7VtOpKfMqo"&gt;Hope Sandoval version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBbVKdN9mGQ"&gt;Simian Mobile Disco mix&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=job_UUsmSBQ"&gt;Fanny (cbg demo)&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 6/10.  Good, but necessary only for Sandoval fans.</content>

    <title>Foo Fighters - "Best of You" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345961+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TU2KQ41xQsI/AAAAAAAAAbo/Xe0xu-fXwvw/s1600/foo-fighters-best-of-you.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TU2KQ41xQsI/AAAAAAAAAbo/Xe0xu-fXwvw/s200/foo-fighters-best-of-you.jpeg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5570260336867623618" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In honor of tomorrow's quasi-national holiday, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLV"&gt;Super Bowl XLV&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_You"&gt;Best of You&lt;/a&gt;" was the first single of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters_%28band%29"&gt;Foo Fighter&lt;/a&gt;'s highly successful 2005 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Your_Honor"&gt;In Your Honor&lt;/a&gt;".  The song is excellent: it has hooks, emotion, power -- everything you want in power pop.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl"&gt;Dave Grohl&lt;/a&gt; has a great rock/punk voice: raspy, powerful, and with range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm always amazed at the success and longevity of the Foo Fighters: I would not have believed you if you told me in 1994 after &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain"&gt;Kurt Cobain&lt;/a&gt;'s death that Grohl, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_%28band%29"&gt;Nirvana&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;drummer&lt;/span&gt; (insert &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Spinal_Tap"&gt;Spinal Tap&lt;/a&gt; reference here), would 1) switch to vocals &amp;amp; guitar, and 2) have a 15+ year run of commercial and critical success. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story really begins with the Foos doing a cover of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_%28musician%29"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Nikki"&gt;Darling Nikki&lt;/a&gt;" on the B-side of their 2003 single "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_It_All_%28single%29"&gt;Have it All&lt;/a&gt;".  In fact, the B-side was originally available on only &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Foo-Fighters-Have-It-All/master/62178"&gt;foreign versions of the single&lt;/a&gt; (Australia &amp;amp; UK), but it gained some airplay in the US.  The story goes that although Grohl did the cover because he was a Prince fan, Prince was not too happy that the Foos covered his song ("&lt;a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,611660_5,00.html"&gt;No! I don't like anyone covering my work. Write your own tunes!&lt;/a&gt;"), and Grohl later &lt;a href="http://prince.org/msg/7/215880"&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; and asked radio stations to stop playing their cover of "Darling Nikki". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to 2007 and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLI"&gt;Super Bowl XLI&lt;/a&gt; and Prince is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows"&gt;halftime show&lt;/a&gt;.  How does one of the most prolific and influential artists of our times fill a 12 minute slot?  It begins with the marching band doing "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Will_Rock_You"&gt;We Will Rock You&lt;/a&gt;"; ok that's surely some kind of marching band law, so that doesn't really count.  He then does two songs from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Rain_%28album%29"&gt;Purple Rain&lt;/a&gt; LP: "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Go_Crazy"&gt;Let's Go Crazy&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_I%27m_a_Star"&gt;Baby I'm a Star&lt;/a&gt;".  Then two covers (a medley, really) of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Mary"&gt;Proud  Mary&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower"&gt;All Along the Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;" -- covers, but so well known that they're standards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were watching the Super Bowl at Terry's house, and I still remember my total surprise when Prince segued from "two riders were approaching / and the wind began to howl" to "are you gone and onto someone new?"  -- was Prince really singing "Best of You"?!  That's a rather obscure, recent, and heavy song for a Super Bowl halftime performance.  Given all the songs Prince could have chosen, using ~2:15 of a 12 minute slot to cover a Foo Fighters song was a pretty bold decision.  From "Best of You", Prince closed the show with the song "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Rain_%28song%29"&gt;Purple Rain&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people seemed to think Prince's cover was a dig at the Foos, but that just doesn't make sense: you don't skip over your own songs like "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_%28song%29"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Corvette"&gt;Little Red Corvette&lt;/a&gt;",  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Doves_Cry"&gt;When Doves Cry&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Would_Die_4_U"&gt;I Would Die 4 U&lt;/a&gt;", etc. just to insult another artist.  I prefer to think of it as a peace offering from Prince, realizing that he had been a bad sport about the whole "Darling Nikki" affair.  For the record the Foo's were flattered, their reaction is covered in &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1551990/foo-fighters-perplexed-by-prince.jhtml"&gt;this story from mtv.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it too much to hope the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Eyed_Peas"&gt;Black Eyed Peas&lt;/a&gt; have a similar surprise in store? (edit: turns out it was too much to hope for -- I don't think it was the &lt;a href="http://www.popeater.com/2011/02/07/black-eyed-peas-halftime/"&gt;disaster&lt;/a&gt; that some claim, but &lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/02/the-black-eyed-peas-at-the-super-bowl-absurdity-at-its-finest.html"&gt;it wasn't very good&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foo Fighters: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW15k6zDorc"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1BUzoiA1Kc"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE7LRKwacr8"&gt;live on Jools Holland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv2I4Jyc-sc"&gt;acoustic version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRbL_94RF8A"&gt;audio only version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.veoh.com/browse/videos/category/music/watch/v6330047nSFChkNw"&gt;full halftime show&lt;/a&gt; ("Best of You" begins at ~6:00). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Darling Nikki" Bonus links: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536dvGMmThw"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmxijQfMow"&gt;"Purple Rain" movie version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foo Fighters: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEoYKYA9oHE"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QMRtr7TGjM"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>The Primitives - "Crash" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345975+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TTzIwGhCTcI/AAAAAAAAAbc/ZSgEgeK0-WY/s1600/the-primitives-crash.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 192px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TTzIwGhCTcI/AAAAAAAAAbc/ZSgEgeK0-WY/s200/the-primitives-crash.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5565543968231542210" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was driving a rental car last week and enjoying satellite radio, mostly the channel "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Wave"&gt;1st Wave&lt;/a&gt;" which plays mildly alternatively pop music from the 70s &amp;amp; 80s.  On came a song that I only barely recognized, so I checked the display and saw that it was "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_%28The_Primitives_song%29"&gt;Crash&lt;/a&gt;" from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Primitives"&gt;The Primitives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't recognize the band name or even the song title, but I could just barely remember having heard the song before.  But where?  I can't recall hearing it on the radio or MTV (the video is not familiar either).  Investigating after I returned, I discovered it was a single from their 1988 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovely_%28The_Primitives_album%29"&gt;Lovely&lt;/a&gt;" and apparently charted very well in the UK and US.  1988 would have been when I was in college, perhaps it was on the radio, or someone down the hall in the dorm, or some random party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did discover that a slightly tarted up version was used in the 1994 film "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_and_Dumber"&gt;Dumb and Dumber&lt;/a&gt;", but I've only seen that film once so I doubt I'm remembering it from the movie.  Although the original version came out in 1988, the sound is more like 1982.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The song itself is harmless fluff that would be at home on a soundtrack to a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_%28filmmaker%29"&gt;John Hughes&lt;/a&gt; film; I'm more intrigued by my partial memory of it since it is unusual for me to not remember a song's context.  Do you remember "Crash"?  If so, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crash: &lt;a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x45s1u_the-primitives-crash_music"&gt;1988 version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crash: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKEnLskeazE"&gt;1995 version&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Slowdive - "Holding Our Breath" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.345989+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TTuvMaDHeJI/AAAAAAAAAbU/M0Qbgf4LokM/s1600/slowdive-holding-our-breath.jpeg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5565234392232065170" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TTuvMaDHeJI/AAAAAAAAAbU/M0Qbgf4LokM/s200/slowdive-holding-our-breath.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 196px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm a big fan of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowdive"&gt;Slowdive&lt;/a&gt; and had thought I had the entire discography, but I recently discovered they had quite a number of singles and EPs prior to their breakthrough 1991 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_for_a_Day"&gt;Just for a Day&lt;/a&gt;".  Eager to complete my collection, I recently acquired their 1991 4-song EP "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Slowdive-Holding-Our-Breath/master/9497"&gt;Holding Our Breath&lt;/a&gt;".  It is out of print, so I ended up purchasing the EP on iTunes since the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Holding-Our-Breath-Slowdive/dp/B000QUZE0K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1295757993&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;going price&lt;/a&gt; for a CD is pretty steep.  The EP appears to be the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Slowdive-Catch-The-Breeze/release/1066843"&gt;"Catch the Breeze" 7" single&lt;/a&gt; extended with two more songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four songs showcase the band's sound firmly in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegazing"&gt;shoegazing&lt;/a&gt; genre: swirling guitar effects, dreamy vocals, slow rhythms; this EP is arguably more in the shadow of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_%28band%29"&gt;MBV&lt;/a&gt; than their later LPs.  "Golden Hair" is a cover of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_%28album%29"&gt;Syd Barrett&lt;/a&gt; song (actually a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce"&gt;James Joyce&lt;/a&gt; poem Barrett set to music), "Catch the Breeze" (which appears on "Just for a Day") and "Albatross" are solid songs, but the standout is "Shine".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the vocal duo of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Goswell"&gt;Rachel Goswell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Halstead"&gt;Neil Halstead&lt;/a&gt;, but "Shine" just reinforces what I think of every time I listen to an LP from Slowdive or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_3"&gt;Mojave 3&lt;/a&gt; (a post-Slowdive band featuring Goswell &amp;amp; Halstead): Rachel should have sang more frequently/prominently.  Her voice fits the genre perfectly. Nothing against Neil, but while he seemed to be featured of the duo, it was Rachel that really defined their sound.  She is the primary (only?) vocalist on "Shine" and the result is an achingly beautiful song, maybe even Slowdive's best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbgWjujwvwo"&gt;Shine&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLWALzYNNms"&gt;Catch the Breeze&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU6TDgqFXbc"&gt;live version 1991&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woPp5R1KGX8"&gt;Albatross&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 7/10.  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXZAzOnrF1g"&gt;Golden Hair&lt;/a&gt;" is nothing special, and "Catch the Breeze" appears elsewhere.  I thought about giving it a 6/10, but "Shine" elevates it to the point that a serious collection should have this EP.  I hope to eventually acquire a hard copy version in the future.</content>

    <title>Jane Siberry - "When I Was a Boy" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346003+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TRvu1DW7r5I/AAAAAAAAAbM/wv09sjDPamM/s1600/Jane_Siberry-When_I_Was_a_Boy_%2528album_cover%2529.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 193px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/TRvu1DW7r5I/AAAAAAAAAbM/wv09sjDPamM/s200/Jane_Siberry-When_I_Was_a_Boy_%2528album_cover%2529.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5556297160493608850" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I first learned of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Siberry"&gt;Jane Siberry&lt;/a&gt; from the "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/06/various-until-end-of-world-lp-review.html"&gt;Until the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;" soundtrack, which was released in 1991 and featured the exquisite duet with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K.d._lang"&gt;k.d. lang&lt;/a&gt;,"Calling All Angels".  Two years later,  it appeared on Siberry's LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_I_Was_a_Boy"&gt;When I Was a Boy&lt;/a&gt;".  But as good as "Calling All Angels" is, it isn't even close to being the best song on this LP.  This is an extraordinary, complex and mature LP.  It is not quite perfect, but even the flaws are admirable: experiments and directions that just don't quite work.  She sings beautifully, but has spoken word parts that remind me of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Anderson"&gt;Laurie Anderson&lt;/a&gt;.  Ultimately, this LP delivers intelligent, unpretentious art-pop for adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first five songs on the LP are the strongest and form a perfect sequence, covering multiple genres while retaining a sensual, spiritual feel: "Temple", "Calling All Angels", "Love is Everything", "Sail Across the Water", "All the Candles in the World".  "Temple" and "Sail Across the Water" are produced by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno"&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt; and are thus the strongest tracks on the LP.  "Temple" and "All the Candles in the World" experiment with a dance / electronica beat, but do so without pandering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the flow is interrupted with "Sweet Incarnadine", which is the only song to skip on the entire LP.  Things pick back up with "An Angel Stepped Down (And Slowly Looked Around)", but unfortunately that is the last excellent song on the LP.  The remaining songs aren't bad ("The Vigil (The Sea)" is pretty good), but they fail to sustain the excellence of tracks 1-5 &amp;amp; 7.   The LP closes with a "Harmony Version" of "Love is Everything", but the difference between the two versions is slight (and the non-harmony version is more intimate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of different versions, there are apparently many different versions of "Temple".  The &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jane+Siberry"&gt;discogs.com discography&lt;/a&gt; is incomplete, but there is a &lt;a href="http://991.com/buy/productinformation.aspx?StockNumber=453617"&gt;5" promo CD&lt;/a&gt; lists three different versions ("Single Mix", "Alternate Single Mix", "Body and Soul Radio Remix", in addition to the LP version), and searching on the web uncovers references to an "Ambient", "Sanctuary", and "Orinoco" mixes. It is not clear if this adds up to 7 different versions or 4, but more importantly what's the point in all the different versions?  Once Brian Eno has produced your song,  everyone else can just go home because you're not going to do better  than his version.  I don't know which version is used in the video linked below, but it is greatly inferior to the stripped down, hard-hitting LP version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, you can &lt;a href="http://www.sheeba.ca/MUSIC/00_06WB_192.zip"&gt;download the entire LP&lt;/a&gt;, including the good version of "Temple", from &lt;a href="http://www.janesiberry.com/"&gt;Siberry's website&lt;/a&gt;.  In 2006, she changed her name to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Siberry#Issa"&gt;Issa&lt;/a&gt;, sold nearly all of her possessions, and released her &lt;a href="http://www.janesiberry.com/janesiberry/music.html"&gt;back catalog as MP3s&lt;/a&gt;.  In 2009, she changed her name back but has retained the free downloads.  You have to respect that, and now you have no reason to not listen to this LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb43KwuMTXU"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;" (not the good LP version!), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bP60GvQET8"&gt;Calling All Angels&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF0ddOhYhjI"&gt;live solo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sheeba.ca/MUSIC/m02CY_08_Calling_All_Angels.mp3"&gt;studio w/o k.d. lang&lt;/a&gt;), "Love is Everything" (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP1AwpTvXGc"&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpom_zMjhdc"&gt;live with band&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2MdvhzJSBE"&gt;live solo&lt;/a&gt;), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVtP-QumhuM"&gt;Sail Across the Water&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ujTe4Fiuc"&gt;All the Candles in the World&lt;/a&gt;" (also not the good LP version), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEWzhP6vKb4"&gt;An Angel Stepped Down (And Slowly Looked Around)&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: "Sweet Incarnadine".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10. If Eno had stuck around for a few more tracks, this would have been an easy 10/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link #1: Additional videos are on her YouTube channel, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sheebatv"&gt;sheebatv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link #2: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUaXa--g900"&gt;Calling All Angels&lt;/a&gt;" sung by the cast of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_%28TV_series%29"&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link #3: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T19UODyJpVA"&gt;Love is Everything&lt;/a&gt;" cover by k.d. lang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link #4: Did you catch the nod to The Beatles "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI38vPDCoao"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;" at ~2:37 in "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEWzhP6vKb4#t=2m37s"&gt;An Angel Stepped Down (And Slowly Looked Around)&lt;/a&gt;"?</content>

This song enjoyed significant contemporary radio and MTV airplay, but it seems to have mostly disappeared from the classic rock radio stations.  The video (pretty good for the times) features real footage of Lowe's marriage to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlene_Carter"&gt;Carlene Carter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite long-running collaborations as a song writer, musician and producer with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Costello"&gt;Elvis Costello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Edmunds"&gt;Dave Edmunds&lt;/a&gt; (solo and as well as part of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockpile"&gt;Rockpile&lt;/a&gt;), Nick Lowe has never really achieved large-scale success.    You might have heard "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ2TuX_ZiEA"&gt;I Knew the Bride&lt;/a&gt;" before, and you might not have known he wrote "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG47gS8xqRM"&gt;What's So Funny About Peace, Love &amp;amp; Understanding?&lt;/a&gt;", but "Cruel to be Kind" will always be his most significant contribution to pop music.  Give it another 10-12 consecutive listens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Cruel to be Kind": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0l3QWUXVho"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  Top of the Pops version: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM4RtUo5s0g"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link:  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_to_Cleo"&gt;Letters to Cleo&lt;/a&gt; did a decent but uninspired cover for the 1999 movie "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Things_I_Hate_About_You"&gt;10 Things I Hate About You&lt;/a&gt;": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9X4rZAA4y8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Howie B - "Another Late Night" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346031+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Skkm2YU00gI/AAAAAAAAAKI/x53QGS7SGJk/s1600-h/AnotherLateNight_HowieB.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Skkm2YU00gI/AAAAAAAAAKI/x53QGS7SGJk/s200/AnotherLateNight_HowieB.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352852347791135234" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sometimes the total is less than the sum of the parts.  I like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Bernstein"&gt;Howie B&lt;/a&gt;, and I like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_mix"&gt;DJ mix LPs&lt;/a&gt; -- I probably own at least a dozen from the various &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Night_Tales"&gt;Another Late Night/Late Night Tales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_Mine"&gt;Back to Mine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ-Kicks"&gt;DJ-Kicks&lt;/a&gt; series as well a handful more outside of those series (e.g., see my review of DJ Shadow's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/04/dj-shadow-funky-skunk-lp-review.html"&gt;Funky Skunk&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Howie B's entry in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Late_Night:_Howie_B"&gt;Another Late Night&lt;/a&gt; series does not come together.  In fact, this is probably my least favorite DJ mix LP -- Howie B just goes through the motions, playing the tracks one after another (almost all of them in their entirety), with little feel for transitions or even an attempt to mix them.   It has the following tracks (lifted from wikipedia.org):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"What It Is?" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undisputed_Truth" title="The Undisputed Truth"&gt;The Undisputed Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Love's Theme" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Unlimited_Orchestra" title="Love Unlimited Orchestra" class="mw-redirect"&gt;Love Unlimited Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Twilight" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_%28band%29" title="Maze (band)"&gt;Maze featuring Frankie Beverly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I Changed My Mind" (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_MCs" title="Stereo MCs"&gt;Stereo MCs&lt;/a&gt; Rattlesnake mix) - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrics_Born" title="Lyrics Born"&gt;Lyrics Born&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; The Poets of Rhythm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Uplink" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratus_%28band%29" title="Stratus (band)"&gt;Stratus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Mirage" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana" title="Carlos Santana"&gt;Santana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Walking In Rhythm" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackbyrds" title="The Blackbyrds"&gt;The Blackbyrds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Summer Hot" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Mayfield" title="Curtis Mayfield"&gt;Curtis Mayfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Contrazoom" (featuring &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfrapp" title="Goldfrapp"&gt;Alison Goldfrapp&lt;/a&gt;) - Spacer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_%28song%29" title="Respiration (song)"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt;" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Star_%28hip_hop_group%29" title="Black Star (hip hop group)"&gt;Black Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Work The Angles" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilated_Peoples" title="Dilated Peoples"&gt;Dilated Peoples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Heavy Tune" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Moerlen%27s_Gong" title="Pierre Moerlen's Gong"&gt;Gong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Under The Boardwalk" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_B" title="Howie B"&gt;Howie B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Violets Don't Be Blue" - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbie_Mann" title="Herbie Mann"&gt;Herbie Mann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Only the transition between "Work the Angles" and "Heavy Tune" has the semblance of a mix, the rest sound like the work of a radio DJ and not a club DJ.  The track listing is suspect too: "Love's Theme" is obvious -- no points awarded there (you might as well sample "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7T4v2l-PIg"&gt;Funky Drummer&lt;/a&gt;").  The requisite rap tracks are good ("I Changed My Mind", "Respiration" and "Work the Angles") as is "Uplink", but the rest of the tracks are dominated by too many meandering 1970s fusion jams ("What It Is?", "Mirage", "Twilight", "Walking in Rhythm", "Summer Hot", "Heavy Tune").  They're not necessarily individually bad (ok, "Mirage" is pretty bad), but how many do we really need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest head scratcher is probably Howie B's version of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Boardwalk"&gt;Under the Boardwalk&lt;/a&gt;" -- it sounds like a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface"&gt;midi&lt;/a&gt; version suitable for karaoke.  I mean that in the worst possible way.  Including some of your own work in a mix is de rigeur, but Howie B insults us with this throwaway track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this was your first DJ mix LP, you might not ever purchase another one.  A more skilled DJ could salvage this song selection with innovative mixing.  Or, minus the mixing, a more thoughtful track selection would have been ok.  To fail at both is unforgivable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Tracks: "I Changed My Mind", "Respiration", "Work the Angles", "Uplink", "Love's Theme"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Tracks:  Pretty much the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 4/10.  You might enjoy some songs individually -- this score reflects the presentation as a mix LP.</content>

    <title>The Specials - "Ghost Town" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346044+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SkfIjeo8vkI/AAAAAAAAAKA/xaPP_Ary1Rc/s1600-h/the-specials-ghost-town.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SkfIjeo8vkI/AAAAAAAAAKA/xaPP_Ary1Rc/s200/the-specials-ghost-town.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352467193998917186" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Town"&gt;Ghost Town&lt;/a&gt;" is a 1981 non-LP single from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials"&gt;The Specials&lt;/a&gt;, the last release from their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials#Original_Specials_line-up"&gt;original lineup&lt;/a&gt;.  Unlike "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/05/specials-rat-race-forgotten-song.html"&gt;Rat Race&lt;/a&gt;" which I vividly recall from early MTV, I have only a vague memory of seeing this video on MTV.  Perhaps because this song sounds so different from others in their oeuvre it is easy to forget.  It features only a few &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska_punk"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt; elements, instead matching the lyrical material with a vast, desolate sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't recall it getting radio airplay in the US at the time, but it was #1 in the UK and has been featured in several movies, including "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Born_Killers"&gt;Natural Born Killers&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_of_the_Dead"&gt;Shaun of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;".  It was also sampled in the Gorillaz song "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45cmPK7e2rE"&gt;Slow Country&lt;/a&gt;" from their 2001 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillaz_%28album%29"&gt;self-titled LP&lt;/a&gt;.  You can't help but wish the original line up of The Specials had managed to stay together for more than two LPs and a few singles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ghost Town" - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WhhSBgd3KI"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpYyqaSYLyw"&gt;Top of the Pops version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B-side bonus links: "Why" - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8PoqDzQ5qs"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;; "Friday Night, Saturday Morning" - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiTwy33Dz5s"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;;</content>

    <title>Sky Larkin - "The Golden Spike" (LP review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346058+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sj0-sxDLqBI/AAAAAAAAAJc/RC4kg-keBuU/s1600-h/SL_GoldenSpike_PS_1.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5349500871187867666" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sj0-sxDLqBI/AAAAAAAAAJc/RC4kg-keBuU/s200/SL_GoldenSpike_PS_1.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Spike"&gt;The Golden Spike&lt;/a&gt;" is the 2009 debut LP from the UK trio &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Larkin"&gt;Sky Larkin&lt;/a&gt;.  I discovered them on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_Recordings"&gt;Wichita Recordings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/wichitarecordings"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; page, a place from which I've discovered many great bands (including &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/The%20Cribs"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bjorn_and_John"&gt;Peter Bjorn and John&lt;/a&gt;) in the last year or two.  Wichita Recordings is signing amazing bands and doing a great job of promoting them via the web (many are in the queue to be reviewed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited about "The Golden Spike" that I ordered the UK copy as soon as it was released -- I couldn't wait for the US version that was to follow a few months later.   Prior to the release of TGS, Sky Larkin released two singles from the LP. The first, "Fossil, I", is a good song but the second, "Beeline", is an infectious indie pop song tour de force.  I can't imagine why this song has not received more buzz.   Peter Bjorn and John's "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51V1VMkuyx0"&gt;Young Ones&lt;/a&gt;" received well-deserved radio airplay -- why not "Beeline"?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nestor Matthews (drums) and Doug Adams (bass) are a good rhythm section but it is fair to say that the band's unique sound is defined by Katie Harkin, both as a vocalist and guitarist.  Harkin perfectly captures the lo-fi, indie sound -- the closest comparison I can think of is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliana_Hatfield"&gt;Juliana Hatfield&lt;/a&gt; (updated by 15-20 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism of this LP (and it is a small criticism) is that at this point Sky Larkin seems to be a better singles band than LP band:  the songs work a bit better one or two at a time than 12 (or 13, counting the hidden track) in a row.  There are no bad songs on the LP, but they're not all at the level of "Beeline", "Matador" or some of my other favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Tracks: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70eYJAworoc"&gt;Beeline&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8udVr-iYqB4"&gt;Matador&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtWq0KwrwDc"&gt;Fossil, I&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFWVpPxuUoc"&gt;One of Two&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU8gEpLVUng"&gt;Molten&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EjmEPrL1b0"&gt;Antibodies&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Tracks:  none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 8/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2009-10-19 Update: I found this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN_E1syFoUY"&gt;short interview&lt;/a&gt; with the band discussing Wichita Recordings, making the "Fossil, I" video and other tidbits on the "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BenevolentShadows"&gt;BenevolentShadows&lt;/a&gt;" YouTube Channel.  It closes with a sample of this live version of "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiKGCSxpWMo"&gt;Matador&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2012-12-16 Update: More acoustic versions of "Matador": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33neSWnXVwY"&gt;2010 Bandstand Busking version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/thehuxcapacitor/matador-acoustic-by-sky-larkin"&gt;free mp3 version on soundcloud&lt;/a&gt; (unknown date)</content>

    <title>Jim Ingram - "Drumbeat" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346072+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SjAjiXrH4OI/AAAAAAAAAJU/8kaOHSLewDg/s1600-h/jim-ingram-drumbeat.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 197px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SjAjiXrH4OI/AAAAAAAAAJU/8kaOHSLewDg/s200/jim-ingram-drumbeat.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345811831066190050" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sometimes you discover things in reverse.  I'm a big fan of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Brothers"&gt;The Chemical Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, and their excellent 2002 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_with_Us"&gt;Come With Us&lt;/a&gt;" features a song called "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Began_in_Afrika"&gt;It Began in Afrika&lt;/a&gt;", whose heavily processed vocal sample of the phrase "it began in Africa" sets the mood for a driving, frenetic track.  Although the sample helps make the track, I had never really thought about its origins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently picked up a copy of 2003's "&lt;a href="http://djuilson.blogspot.com/2008/06/various-ultimate-lessons-vol-3.html"&gt;Ultimate Lessons, Volume 3&lt;/a&gt;" and it also has a track called "It Began in Africa" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatboy_Slim"&gt;Fatboy Slim&lt;/a&gt;.  The "Ultimate Lessons" series I'm reserving for future reviews, but they appear to be low-volume bootlegs of DJ mixes of questionable legality due to uncleared samples (&lt;a href="http://djuilson.blogspot.com/2008/06/various-ultimate-lessons-vol-1.html"&gt;Volume 1&lt;/a&gt; had the original &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dee_and_Steinski"&gt;Double Dee and Steinski&lt;/a&gt; recordings from the early 80s).  They're released on &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Starchild+Recordings"&gt;Starchild Recordings&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to exist only to release this series.  After searching the web further, I found that this song was originally released in 1988 by the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Urban+All+Stars"&gt;Urban All Stars&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently one of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatboy_Slim#Bands_and_pseudonyms"&gt;many aliases of Norman Cook&lt;/a&gt; (known to most as Fatboy Slim).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intrigued by the similarity, I searched further and discovered that both versions of the song are based on a track called "Drumbeat", from the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Jim-Ingram-Drumbeat/release/1229872"&gt;1974 LP of the same name&lt;/a&gt; by spoken word artist &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jim+Ingram"&gt;Jim Ingram&lt;/a&gt;.  Whereas The Chemical Brothers &lt;a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=8648"&gt;sampled just the phrase "It began in Africa"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.dustygroove.com/item.php?id=bqw4gqntk2"&gt;UA version&lt;/a&gt; is a mix of "Drumbeat", the Jackson Sisters - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNOVaFGtSeU"&gt;I Believe in Miracles&lt;/a&gt;" and Maceo &amp;amp; the Macks - "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd-PlFJlF4Q"&gt;Cross the Track&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck finding the original Jim Ingram recording -- it does not appear to have been re-released or even bootlegged.  Fortunately, someone was kind enough to upload it to YouTube.  The versions by The Chemical Brothers and Urban All Stars are not quite cover songs in the conventional sense, but it is always interesting to hear the original sources after hearing the sample.  Presented in the order of my discovery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chemical Brothers - "It Began in Afrika": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRC7zKfKomc"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Urban All Stars - "It Began in Africa": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3iMPIwVZLE"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Ingram - "Drumbeat": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO4WBkLV3qs"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

Elvis Costello covering a Kinks song.  Duets with Kate Pierson &amp;amp; Michael Stipe, and Jane Siberry &amp;amp; k. d. lang.  Artists like Neneh Cherry, U2,  Depeche Mode, Can, Patti Smith and the Talking Heads recording with the same "sound."  If these things sound intriguing to you, then you should love the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Until_the_End_of_the_World_%28soundtrack%29"&gt;Until the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;" soundtrack.  I saw &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Until_the_End_of_the_World"&gt;the film&lt;/a&gt; once at the &lt;a href="http://www.narocinema.com/"&gt;Naro Cinema&lt;/a&gt; (probably in  1992) after I already had fallen in love with the LP.  I can't honestly say I understood the film (I suppose I should give it another try), but fortunately the soundtrack does not depend on the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the LP that really turned me on to soundtracks as a genre; this is the LP that I measure all other soundtracks against.  The most amazing part of this LP is that all of the songs (except for U2's eponymous song) were unreleased and new for this LP, yet it sounds like they were recorded specifically for this LP (many of the songs were subsequently released on later LPs).  Despite the range of artists, the songs are united by a hazy, desolate other-worldly feel.  Taking the track listing from wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Revell" title="Graeme Revell"&gt;Graeme Revell&lt;/a&gt;: "Opening Theme" (Revell) (Solo &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello" title="Cello"&gt;cello&lt;/a&gt; performed by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Darling" title="David Darling"&gt;David Darling&lt;/a&gt;) – 1:59&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads" title="Talking Heads"&gt;Talking Heads&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sax_and_Violins" title="Sax and Violins"&gt;Sax and Violins&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne_%28musician%29" title="David Byrne (musician)" class="mw-redirect"&gt;David Byrne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Frantz" title="Chris Frantz"&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Harrison" title="Jerry Harrison"&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Weymouth" title="Tina Weymouth"&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/a&gt;) – 5:18&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julee_Cruise" title="Julee Cruise"&gt;Julee Cruise&lt;/a&gt;: "Summer Kisses, Winter Tears" (Jack Lloyd, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Weisman" title="Ben Weisman"&gt;Ben Weisman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Wise_%28lyricist%29" title="Fred Wise (lyricist)" class="mw-redirect"&gt;Fred Wise&lt;/a&gt;) – 2:37&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neneh_Cherry" title="Neneh Cherry"&gt;Neneh Cherry&lt;/a&gt;: "Move With Me (Dub)" (Cherry, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_McVey" title="Cameron McVey"&gt;Cameron McVey&lt;/a&gt;) – 2:58&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_the_City_Solution" title="Crime and the City Solution"&gt;Crime and the City Solution&lt;/a&gt;, "The Adversary" (Bronwyn Adams, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Bonney" title="Simon Bonney"&gt;Simon Bonney&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Haas, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hacke" title="Alexander Hacke"&gt;Alexander Hacke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Harvey" title="Mick Harvey"&gt;Mick Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, Thomas Stern) – 5:32&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed" title="Lou Reed"&gt;Lou Reed&lt;/a&gt;: "What's Good" (Reed) – 5:07&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_%28band%29" title="Can (band)"&gt;Can&lt;/a&gt;: "Last Night Sleep" (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Mooney" title="Malcolm Mooney"&gt;Malcolm Mooney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaki_Liebezeit" title="Jaki Liebezeit"&gt;Jaki Liebezeit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Karoli" title="Michael Karoli"&gt;Michael Karoli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irmin_Schmidt" title="Irmin Schmidt"&gt;Irmin Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;) – 3:35&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M._%28band%29" title="R.E.M.

I'm a Lou Reed fan, and its not necessarily a bad song, but the start to finish enjoyment of the LP is enhanced if you skip this song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength of "The Adversary", probably my favorite song on the entire LP, caused me to spend a good bit of time hunting up copies of two other Crime and the City solution LPs: "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Crime-The-City-Solution-Shine/master/67135"&gt;Shine&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Crime-The-City-Solution-The-Bride-Ship/master/67136"&gt;The Bride Ship&lt;/a&gt;".  I remember being disappointed that they were not as good as the song "The Adversary", but I should probably give them another try (I can't seem to find them right now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This LP also turned me on to artists like Jane Siberry, whose 1993 LP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2010/12/jane-siberry-when-i-was-boy-lp-review.html"&gt;When I was a Boy&lt;/a&gt;" I'll review in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had this LP, I purchased a copy of another Wim Wenders soundtrack: 1988's "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Various-Wings-Of-Desire/release/2076953"&gt;Wings of Desire&lt;/a&gt;".  Despite some of the same artists (like Crime and the City Solution), it is not nearly as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Tracks: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FJ8x6wnZy8"&gt;Sax and Violins&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5Y_vWhCMo"&gt;Summer Kisses, Winter Tears&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neneh+Cherry/_/Move+With+Me+%28Dub%29"&gt;Move With Me (Dub)&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJJynypn3BA"&gt;The Adversary&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxmEsmEub7Q"&gt;Fretless&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/_/Days"&gt;Days&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gctmy_Eu1wo"&gt;(I'll Love You) Till the End of the World"&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1CmyXzOx_c"&gt;Death's Door&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63bV6WlL9iA"&gt;Calling All Angels&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GCoIkHq8c"&gt;Humans from Earth&lt;/a&gt;" (a slightly different version), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abf3yr-2nVY"&gt;Sleeping in the Devil's Bed&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI6sBdA99c8"&gt;Until the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;" (also a slightly different version).  I'm not kidding, they're all &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Tracks:  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd5SjVK2Dz0"&gt;What's Good&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10</content>

    <title>2 Skinnee J's - "Riot Nrrrd" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346099+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SiiCITvtBXI/AAAAAAAAAJE/0NGdm8LneEs/s1600-h/2sj-riot-nrrrd.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343664037126014322" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SiiCITvtBXI/AAAAAAAAAJE/0NGdm8LneEs/s200/2sj-riot-nrrrd.png" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 175px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"Riot Nrrrd" is a single from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Skinnee_J%27s"&gt;2 Skinnee J's&lt;/a&gt; first LP, 1998's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMercado%21"&gt;Supermercado!&lt;/a&gt;".  This song is time capsule in many ways.  First, the very title is a nod to the early 1990's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Grrrl"&gt;Riot Grrrl&lt;/a&gt; movement.  Second, the music is firmly within the 1990's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska_punk"&gt;punk/rap/ska&lt;/a&gt; sound, including fellow &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Records"&gt;Capricorn Records&lt;/a&gt; label-mates &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/311_%28band%29"&gt;311&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_%28band%29"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_%28band%29"&gt;Everything&lt;/a&gt;.  Third, droll name checking of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_%28film_director%29"&gt;John Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall"&gt;Anthony Michael Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underoos"&gt;Underroos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThunderCats"&gt;Thundercats&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_%28TV_special%29#The_Island_of_Misfit_Toys"&gt;Island of Misfit Toys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams"&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_%28novel%29"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt; leaves little doubt this song is by and for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X"&gt;Gen Xers&lt;/a&gt;.  Take time to explore the &lt;a href="http://lyricwiki.org/2_Skinnee_J%27s:Riot_Nrrrd"&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt;; they are especially funny if you lived it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This song received a good bit of radio airplay when it came out but seems to have fallen out of favor, perhaps edged out on the local stations by its ponderous cousin, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_metal"&gt;nu metal&lt;/a&gt; (ZZZzzzz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeLMckmfiI8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2010-04-15 Edit: The YouTube version linked above seems to have lost its audio track, so here's a version on &lt;a href="http://www.clip4e.com/play_2_skinnee_j_s_riot_nrrd.htm"&gt;clip4e.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013-09-27 Edit: Here's a new version on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt6mC66Las"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>The Nerves - "Hanging on the Telephone" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346113+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sh39zwlyioI/AAAAAAAAAI8/ZoSkS3kw6SM/s1600-h/the-nerves.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5340703798789835394" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sh39zwlyioI/AAAAAAAAAI8/ZoSkS3kw6SM/s200/the-nerves.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 192px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Although "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_on_the_Telephone"&gt;Hanging on the Telephone&lt;/a&gt;" was popularized by Blondie, it was first released on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nerves"&gt;The Nerves&lt;/a&gt;' eponymous, 1976 four song EP.  Don't feel bad if you've never heard of them: The Nerves released this EP, toured briefly, established a template for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_music"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt; bands like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Knack"&gt;The Knack&lt;/a&gt;,  broke up, and then formed the basis for bands like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beat_%28US%29"&gt;The Beat&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Collins_%28musician%29"&gt;Paul Collins&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plimsouls"&gt;The Plimsouls&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Case"&gt;Peter Case&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The song was released as a &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Blondie-Hanging-On-The-Telephone/master/64444"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_%28band%29"&gt;Blondie&lt;/a&gt;'s 1978 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lines"&gt;Parallel Lines&lt;/a&gt;".  Blondie is mostly remembered now for their songs that flirted with  (arguably bordering on parodying) other genres such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt; ("&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g"&gt;Rapture&lt;/a&gt;"), &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae"&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt; ("&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppYgrdJ0pWk"&gt;The Tide is High&lt;/a&gt;") and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; ("&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGU_4-5RaxU"&gt;Heart of Glass&lt;/a&gt;").  Songs like "Hanging on the Telephone" remind the listener that Blondie was primarily a new wave band.  Although I have contemporary memories of other singles from "Parallel Lines" (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXewIR7Y7cc"&gt;One Way or Another&lt;/a&gt;") getting TV and radio play, I don't recall the same for "Hanging on the Telephone".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other versions of the song are listed below, but they are all pretty close to the original.  But when the original is two and half minutes of power pop perfection, why mess with it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nerves: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emy5mA8Ixtc"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  This sounds like what I think &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys"&gt;The Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt; would have sounded like if they had started in 1976 instead of 1961.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Collins and Peter Case: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px-QXkcqVgY"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.   Only &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lee_%28musician%29"&gt;Jack Lee&lt;/a&gt; is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blondie: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWhkbDMISl8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;; a live, 1979 &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIcdNjG1Jlg"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt;; a live, 1999 version from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_zeVLfCa8k"&gt;The Late Show with David Letterman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beat: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayugEeVHJU8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L7_%28band%29"&gt;L7&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bb8LC222nQ"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.    From the 1995 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerky_Boys"&gt;Jerky Boys&lt;/a&gt; soundtrack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Leppard"&gt;Def Leppard&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJFXOwtRGA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  From their 2006 cover song LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah%21_%28album%29"&gt;Yeah!&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Tracks from the "The Nerves" EP: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIsjXPc7VGg"&gt;When You Find Out&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/goto?rcid=tra.23836325"&gt;Give Me Some Time&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4AzyUCyCs"&gt;Working Too Hard&lt;/a&gt;".</content>

    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ShsKzHNYVnI/AAAAAAAAAI0/tiRDIZRK3F8/s1600-h/dj-shadow-wdysll.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5339873656402630258" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ShsKzHNYVnI/AAAAAAAAAI0/tiRDIZRK3F8/s200/dj-shadow-wdysll.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 160px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 160px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Most people are probably familiar with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow"&gt;DJ Shadow&lt;/a&gt;'s "What Does Your Soul Look Like", parts 1-4.  Part 4 and a slightly edited version of Part 1 appeared on 1996's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endtroducing....."&gt;Endtroducing....&lt;/a&gt;", and all four parts appeared on the 1998 compilation LP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/04/dj-shadow-preemptive-strike-lp-review.html"&gt;Preemptive Strike&lt;/a&gt;" arguably forming the core of the LP).  But in 1994, "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/DJ-Shadow-What-Does-Your-Soul-Look-Like/master/15366"&gt;What Does Your Soul Look Like&lt;/a&gt;" was released as a  single on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo%27Wax"&gt;Mo' Wax Records&lt;/a&gt; (albeit, a 32+ minute "single"). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I could create the same effect by creating a play list from "Preemptive Strike", I purchased the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/DJ-Shadow-What-Does-Your-Soul-Look-Like/release/18987"&gt;out-of-print CD version&lt;/a&gt; off eBay  many years ago.  As a collector, I just had to have the original release.  "Endtroducing...." put DJ Shadow on the map and early singles (such as "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh3VztS42JE"&gt;Lost and Found&lt;/a&gt;", which was inexplicably left off "Preemptive Strike") gave a preview of where his music would go.  But these four songs represent his finest work to date.  If you are not familiar with these songs, you owe it to yourself to listen.  If you are familiar with them, try decontextualizing them from the middle of "Preemptive Strike" and listen to them as release by themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Tracks: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9zJgTu5D9E"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSEQYDjKVNs"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpAN1MZUO1E"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axg2N1D8V-g"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Tracks: none. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10.</content>

    <title>The Specials - "Rat Race" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346171+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ShMtzPhWjxI/AAAAAAAAAIs/s5cRuT5-L94/s1600-h/The-Specials-Rat-Race-361988-991.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 180px; height: 180px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ShMtzPhWjxI/AAAAAAAAAIs/s5cRuT5-L94/s200/The-Specials-Rat-Race-361988-991.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5337660341727170322" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's been a while since my last remembrance of early MTV.  I don't recall &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska#2_Tone"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt; getting much radio airplay in the early 80s in Hampton Roads, but it was a staple of the early days of MTV.  It was big in the UK at the time and as I've covered before, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/barnes-and-barnes-fish-heads-forgotten.html"&gt;MTV played pretty much anything during the early days&lt;/a&gt;.  Artists on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Tone"&gt;2-Tone Records&lt;/a&gt; were putting out videos and MTV played them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't really a fan of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials"&gt;The Specials&lt;/a&gt; during the early 80s (it was beyond my middle school comprehension), but I was exposed to it.  I've since become a big fan and their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials_discography#Studio_albums"&gt;first two LPs&lt;/a&gt; are on the "to review" list (a very long list, btw).   "Rat Race", their 1980 non-LP single, is my first memory of them on MTV.  It is certainly not their most popular song (that would most likely be "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LDvwPXpThM"&gt;A Message to You, Rudy&lt;/a&gt;"), but unless you have the various &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials_discography#Compilation_albums_and_compilation_contributions"&gt;compilation LPs&lt;/a&gt; on which it appears (or the &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Specials-Rat-Race/master/8213"&gt;original 7"&lt;/a&gt;), I doubt you've heard this excellent song in a long time.  Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmkMEoVb6rA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B-side Bonus link: "Rude Boys Outta Jail": &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-athnwFoMok"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Cut Chemist - "Bunky's Pick" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346184+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sg7gwiDzEyI/AAAAAAAAAIk/yU8vC9hR71U/s1600-h/cut-chemist-bunkys-pick.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5336449732861694754" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sg7gwiDzEyI/AAAAAAAAAIk/yU8vC9hR71U/s200/cut-chemist-bunkys-pick.jpeg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/121919"&gt;Bunky's Pick&lt;/a&gt;" is not really an LP, but a 2001 three song single (at 21+ minutes, perhaps it should be considered an EP) released on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stones_Throw_Records"&gt;Stones Throw Records&lt;/a&gt;.  It was very puzzling when I first got it many years ago:  "Bunky's Pick" is by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_Chemist"&gt;Cut Chemist&lt;/a&gt;, "6 Variations of In the Rain" is by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madlib"&gt;Madlib&lt;/a&gt;, and "In the Rain" is by &lt;a href="http://bilpen2.tripod.com/"&gt;Billy Wooten&lt;/a&gt;.  The reconstructions from Cut Chemist and Madlib were great (as you would expect) and the song by Billy Wooten was beautiful.  But why did this single/EP exist?  Why does Cut Chemist have primary billing?  Who is Billy Wooten?  I didn't understand how these three songs came to be on the same release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually learned this can be best thought of as a companion to the compilation LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Funky_16_Corners"&gt;The Funky 16 Corners&lt;/a&gt;", also released on Stones Throw Records.  In fact, "Bunky's Pick" is a bonus track on some versions of the LP.  Cut Chemist remixed the highlights from the LP into a single 7:48 track.  As Madlib's song title suggests, he focuses just on different interpretations of  "In the Rain".  Although I haven't seen a physical copy, apparently some versions of this single &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=121919"&gt;featured Madlib&lt;/a&gt; with primary billing.  IIRC, this single was also my first introduction to Madlib.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To contrast with the Madlib version, the original version of "In the Rain" is also provided ("In the Rain" is also on "The Funky 16 Corners", although it originally appears on "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Wooden-Glass-TheBilly-Wooten-The-Wooden-Glass-Recorded-Live/release/1535655"&gt;The Wooden Glass Recorded Live&lt;/a&gt;").  Billy Wooten (the featured artist in the group "&lt;a href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/funky16/wooten.html"&gt;Wooden Glass&lt;/a&gt;") is a jazz &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphone"&gt;vibraphonist&lt;/a&gt; and this song was my first introduction to him.  Prior to hearing this, I would have been skeptical about "jazz vibraphone", but you can't deny the beauty of this song.  I guess I'm a believer now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Tracks: &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/djtimesmagazine/cut-chemist-bunky-s-pick-bonus"&gt;Bunky's Pick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2K2KsSqGRc"&gt;6 Variations of In the Rain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-rIpTpozk0"&gt;In the Rain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Tracks: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10</content>

    <title>The Clash - "Bankrobber" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346198+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SgiSQZxYfdI/AAAAAAAAAIU/yUdFsnEcBHw/s1600-h/602px-Bankrobber-clash.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334674569113927122" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SgiSQZxYfdI/AAAAAAAAAIU/yUdFsnEcBHw/s200/602px-Bankrobber-clash.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 199px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What's the greatest &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash"&gt;Clash&lt;/a&gt; song you've never heard?  Probably "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrobber"&gt;Bankrobber&lt;/a&gt;", a 1980 single that was recorded during the sessions for "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista%21"&gt;Sandinista!&lt;/a&gt;" but was not released on that LP.  It has made it on to a few compilation LPs, including 1980's 10" EP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Black_Market_Clash#Black_Market_Clash"&gt;Black Market Clash&lt;/a&gt;", where it was combined with "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrobber#Robber_Dub"&gt;Robber Dub&lt;/a&gt;" (a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music"&gt;dub&lt;/a&gt; version of "Bankrobber") as a single song.  Unfortunately, when "Black Market Clash" was reissued as "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Black_Market_Clash"&gt;Super Black Market Clash&lt;/a&gt;", only "Robber Dub" was kept and "Bankrobber" was deleted (perhaps the only flaw in an otherwise good B-side collection).  You can find the single version of "Bankrobber" on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash_discography#Compilations"&gt;many, many compilation LPs&lt;/a&gt; that have since been released, but I'm not aware of an LP in print that offers the 6:16 version of "Bankrobber/Robber Dub".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly enough, the B-side of the "Bankrobber" single did not feature "Robber Dub" (though it was originally intended that way) but instead features "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrobber#Rockers_Galore...UK_Tour"&gt;Rockers Galore... UK Tour&lt;/a&gt;", which is essentially an instrumental version of "Bankrobber" with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikey_Dread"&gt;Mikey Dread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deejaying"&gt;toasting&lt;/a&gt; over the track.  Dread is the producer of the single and is featured in the video ("&lt;a href="http://insomniaradio.net/category/ir-specialty-shows/mikey-dread-dread-at-the-controls/"&gt;Dread at the controls&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Bankrobber" is probably the highlight of &lt;a href="http://www.jahworks.org/music/cd/reggae_punk.htm"&gt;punk/reggae&lt;/a&gt; hybrid.  The Clash's covers of reggae songs are excellent (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/toots-maytals-pressure-drop-song.html"&gt;Pressure Drop&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzZ1N9IuzJM"&gt;Police on My Back&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQXgfD0UKIY"&gt;Police and Thieves&lt;/a&gt;"), but they're covers.  Here we find the band comfortably writing original music at the nexus of the two genres. Considering all the puzzling songs that appear on "Sandinista!", I sure wish they had found room for "Bankrobber" and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bankrobber: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttJBdr6eBuo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (official video), &lt;a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1gqfs_the-clash-bank-robberpunk-rock-77_music"&gt;Dailymotion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSl0w5Cqj-Y"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robber Dub: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdT-u81hJRI"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bankrobber/Robber Dub: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCTCvg1yL8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rockers Galore... UK Tour: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvV52NStRto"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/s/Rockers+Galore+Uk+Tour+feat+Mikey+Dread+/c0GFM?src=5"&gt;Grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Big Audio Dynamite II - "Rush" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346212+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SgJENQt91ZI/AAAAAAAAAIM/4_hLRob_RiM/s1600-h/Big_Audio_Dynamite_II_-_Rush.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5332899903376840082" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SgJENQt91ZI/AAAAAAAAAIM/4_hLRob_RiM/s200/Big_Audio_Dynamite_II_-_Rush.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 192px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Shortly after &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jones_%28The_Clash%29"&gt;Mick Jones&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash#Disintegration:_1982.E2.80.931984"&gt;fired from The Clash&lt;/a&gt;, he formed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Audio_Dynamite"&gt;Big Audio Dynamite (BAD)&lt;/a&gt;.  BAD, which also featured &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Letts"&gt;Don Letts&lt;/a&gt;,  explored the genre-bending, hip-hop/rock crossovers that The Clash had explored in earlier releases like "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/clash-this-is-radio-clash-forgotten.html"&gt;This is Radio Clash&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista%21"&gt;Sandinista!&lt;/a&gt;".  BAD made music that was ahead of its time, but it never really had a stable line up.  Starting in 1990, due to line up changes the band was billed as "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Audio_Dynamite#Big_Audio_Dynamite_II_.281991-1993.29"&gt;Big Audio Dynamite II&lt;/a&gt;" and by the time of 1991's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Globe_%28album%29"&gt;The Globe&lt;/a&gt;" LP, only Mick Jones remained as the original member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first single from "The Globe" was "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_%28BAD_song%29"&gt;Rush&lt;/a&gt;" and it fared pretty well on radio.  I'm always of two minds when I hear this song:  1)  Why did this amazing song not receive &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt; airplay than it did, and 2)  How did this song receive &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; airplay?  The minute long "break" (approximately 1:51 - 2:58) breaks every rule imaginable for a successful single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h8zs898lr4"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tinysong.com/I2GI"&gt;studio version (grooveshark.com)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evmCJoLTywE"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sonybmg"&gt;SonyBMG&lt;/a&gt; gets it.  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSmRQLtqTM"&gt;WMG&lt;/a&gt; still doesn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S.  With the advent of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vevo"&gt;Vevo&lt;/a&gt;, SonyBMG gets it a lot less than they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.P.S.  SonyBMG / Vevo &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h8zs898lr4"&gt;no longer get it&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>DJ Shadow - "Funky Skunk" (LP review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346225+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sfm-L7u6xDI/AAAAAAAAAIE/jfr1vfWsFhU/s1600-h/2378-funky-skunk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5330500746192012338" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sfm-L7u6xDI/AAAAAAAAAIE/jfr1vfWsFhU/s200/2378-funky-skunk.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Released in 2005, "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/DJ-Shadow-Funky-Skunk/release/567334"&gt;Funky Skunk&lt;/a&gt;" is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_mix"&gt;DJ mix &lt;/a&gt;LP released as a "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow"&gt;DJ Shadow&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obey_Giant"&gt;Obey&lt;/a&gt; Reconstruction".  Obey Giant is a pseudonym for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey"&gt;Shepard Fairey&lt;/a&gt;, now best known for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22HOPE%22_poster"&gt;Barrack Obama Hope Poster&lt;/a&gt;.  I believe the LP is self-released (it is not clear what label, if any, it is actually on) and Fairey handled the artwork.  Presumably a limited number received posters, stickers, etc., but my copy came in a jewel case without any bonus items -- or any information on the insert card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, half the fun of a mix LP is trying to determine all the various tracks.  At the time of this writing, the Wikipedia page for "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Skunk"&gt;Funky Skunk&lt;/a&gt;" has only 9 sources identified, and they are mostly the easily identifiable songs (recent and novelty songs).  The entire LP is a single track of approximately 66 minutes.  Assume an average of 1 song per minute, and less than 15% of the sources have been identified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DJ Shadow does a great job on this mix -- easily weaving some new hip hop songs with mostly old school hip hop, with just a sprinkling of novelty (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/dennisthefox"&gt;Dennis the Fox&lt;/a&gt;'s "Mothertrucker"), funk,  and rock songs.  This mix stands out from the previous mix LPs he's done with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_Chemist"&gt;Cut Chemist&lt;/a&gt;,  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfreeze_%28album%29"&gt;Brainfreeze&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/05/dj-shadow-cut-chemist-product-placement.html"&gt;Product Placement&lt;/a&gt;" (whose sources are now identified).  Those LPs featured only 7" 45 RPMs, collaboratively mixed in real-time, and as a result of choosing 7" records they had more humor and camp (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=751hUX_q0Do"&gt;Rappin' with Gas&lt;/a&gt;").   "Mothertrucker" is the only campy song on the LP.  It's the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks"&gt;Jar Jar Binks&lt;/a&gt; of this mix, but mercifully more like "Revenge of the Sith" and not "Phantom Menace".  Aside from (I believe) only 1 song from "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/The%20Outsider"&gt;The Outsider&lt;/a&gt;", these songs represent new beats and samples that DJ Shadow has not used before in previous releases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Tracks: N/A since it is only 1 track, but 19:56 -- 41:13 is the strongest part of the mix.  It is mostly 80's era hip hop.&amp;nbsp; Edit: here is the &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/niko-lai/dj-shadow-funky-skunk-full"&gt;entire LP on soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Tracks: N/A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 8/10</content>

    <title>Dntel - "Dumb Luck" (LP review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346239+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SetjEQRAH-I/AAAAAAAAAH8/e-TX3fXg-Qo/s1600-h/600px-DntelDumbLuck.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SetjEQRAH-I/AAAAAAAAAH8/e-TX3fXg-Qo/s200/600px-DntelDumbLuck.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5326459909032648674" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dntel"&gt;Dntel&lt;/a&gt;" is one of the personas of James Scott Tamborello, another one being "James Figurine" (of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurine_%28band%29"&gt;Figurine&lt;/a&gt;).  Although he's  had other projects/bands as well, Tamborello is probably best well-known for creating &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Postal_Service"&gt;The Postal Service&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gibbard"&gt;Ben Gibbard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Cab_for_Cutie"&gt;Death Cab for Cutie&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact, The Postal Service was created because of how well Gibbard's guest vocals were received on &lt;span class="description"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE9k0OhoxXA"&gt;(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan&lt;/a&gt;" from Dntel's 2001 LP, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Full_of_Possibilities"&gt;Life is Full of Possibilities&lt;/a&gt;".  I have Johan to thank for introducing me to The Postal Service and Dntel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conventional wisdom states that Dntel's 2007 follow-up, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_Luck_%28album%29"&gt;Dumb Luck&lt;/a&gt;", is not as good as LIFOP.  Perhaps this is because of high expectations resulting from the 6 year wait, or comparison with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Postal_Service_discography"&gt;The Postal Service's acclaimed releases&lt;/a&gt; in the interim.  Perhaps the fact that Dntel switched labels from the tiny &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_Research"&gt;Plug Research&lt;/a&gt; to "major-indie" &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Pop"&gt;Sub Pop&lt;/a&gt;.  I, however, think "Dumb Luck" is an extraordinary LP that surpasses LIFOP.  On the whole, Dumb Luck's songs are slightly less experimental than those on LIFOP, but for me it makes for a more enjoyable start to finish listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with &lt;/span&gt;Tamborello enlisting the help of a veritable who's who of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop"&gt;indie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electropop"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_country"&gt;alternative country&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacoustic_music"&gt;electroacoutistic&lt;/a&gt;  and related genres.  Some of these artists he's collaborated with before, but some are new.  Pulling the track listing from Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Dumb Luck"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"To a Fault" [ft. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_Bear_%28band%29" title="Grizzly Bear (band)"&gt;Grizzly Bear&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I'd Like to Know" [ft. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lali_Puna" title="Lali Puna"&gt;Lali Puna&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Roll On" [ft. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Lewis" title="Jenny Lewis"&gt;Jenny Lewis&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"The Distance" [ft. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_%26_Yu" title="Arthur &amp;amp; Yu"&gt;Arthur &amp;amp; Yu&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Rock My Boat" [ft. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Doi_Todd" title="Mia Doi Todd"&gt;Mia Doi Todd&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Natural Resources" [ft. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Broder" title="Andrew Broder"&gt;Andrew Broder&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_%28band%29" title="Fog (band)"&gt;Fog&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Breakfast in Bed" [ft. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Oberst" title="Conor Oberst"&gt;Conor Oberst&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Dreams" [ft. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_Chords_of_Memory" title="Mystic Chords of Memory"&gt;Mystic Chords of Memory&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Everything's Tricks"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: my copy (and perhaps yours too) does not have the last track "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJk4uKSwjmQ"&gt;Everything's Tricks&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title track, which does not feature a guest artist, is very much in the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_music"&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;" sound of LIFOP.  But even this song, despite its surface noise, is very listenable even to those that don't like electronica noise.  And while there are no tracks I  skip on my iPod, there are  two amazing songs that I often rewind and play again and again before continuing with the rest of the LP.  "Roll On" with Jenny Lewis is the most captivating combination of electronica and country you'll ever hear.  In a perfect world, this song would be a cross-over hit on the pop charts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other track is Conor Oberst's "Breakfast in Bed", which tells a touching, if dark and  disturbing story of a new relationship.  The lyrics "If this is all a game can you just say it is / I'll do it anyway so it makes no difference" make me think of Lloyd Dobler in "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say_Anything"&gt;Say Anything&lt;/a&gt;": "One question: do you need... someone, or do you need me?... Forget it, I don't really care."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Tracks:  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MTOKhu4aOg"&gt;Roll On&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epR37msATec"&gt;Breakfast in Bed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixP2mFnwqEw&amp;amp;"&gt;Rock My Boat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxG6WOpV3QI"&gt;Dumb Luck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wnve38Sqok"&gt;Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DNtA6vjx_E"&gt;The Distance&lt;/a&gt;.  (Find the rest of the audio tracks at &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/dntel/albums.jhtml?albumId=1491675"&gt;mtv.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Tracks: None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10</content>

    <title>(Various) - "The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young" (LP Review  )</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346252+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SeIagaK-51I/AAAAAAAAAH0/NbtPlajMXRc/s1600-h/the-bridge-neil-young.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SeIagaK-51I/AAAAAAAAAH0/NbtPlajMXRc/s200/the-bridge-neil-young.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5323846853588870994" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This review goes out to Daryl, a HS/college friend that turned me on to this LP as well as various others by Neil Young, Bob Dylan and similar artists.  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge:_A_Tribute_to_Neil_Young"&gt;The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young&lt;/a&gt;" is a 1989 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute_album"&gt;tribute LP&lt;/a&gt;  released on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Records"&gt;Caroline Records&lt;/a&gt; featuring various artists (mostly 80s college / alternative rock) covering songs originally by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young"&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt;.  The LP supported &lt;a href="http://www.bridgeschool.org/"&gt;The Bridge School&lt;/a&gt;, which teaches communication skills to children with severe impairments.  The Bridge School was co-founded by Neil's wife, Pegi: their two sons have cerebral palsy and their daughter has epilepsy.  See also the concert benefit series the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_School_Benefit"&gt;Bridge School Benefit&lt;/a&gt;". Neil has said that the prominent use of a  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder"&gt;vocoder&lt;/a&gt; on the commercially unsuccessful "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_%28album%29"&gt;Trans&lt;/a&gt;" LP in 1982 was inspired by his efforts to communicate with his son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I explained in an &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/toots-maytals-pressure-drop-song.html"&gt;earlier review&lt;/a&gt; I really like covers, so naturally I like tribute LPs.  The only problem with tribute LPs is they often have wildly uneven quality.  Some of the artists and/or song choices really work and some don't.  While Neil Young's canon is hard to reduce to 15 songs, the only song that is arguably missing is "Heart of  Gold " from 1972's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_%28album%29"&gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt;" .  "Heart of Gold" is too popular, and there seems to be an unwritten rule on tribute LPs that nobody wants to cover the artist's most popular song (presumably choosing a more obscure song to cover demonstrates your depth of knowledge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lifting the track listing straight from Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barstool_Blues" title="Barstool Blues" class="mw-redirect"&gt;Barstool Blues&lt;/a&gt;" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Asylum" title="Soul Asylum"&gt;Soul Asylum&lt;/a&gt; – 2:51&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Let_It_Bring_You_Down" title="Don't Let It Bring You Down"&gt;Don't Let It Bring You Down&lt;/a&gt;" –  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Williams" title="Victoria Williams"&gt;Victoria Williams&lt;/a&gt; – 2:53&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_Gold_Rush_%28song%29" title="After the Gold Rush (song)"&gt;After the Gold Rush&lt;/a&gt;" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips" title="The Flaming Lips"&gt;The Flaming Lips&lt;/a&gt; – 4:14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Captain Kennedy" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Sudden" title="Nikki Sudden"&gt;Nikki Sudden&lt;/a&gt; – 4:01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_Girl_%28Neil_Young_song%29" title="Cinnamon Girl (Neil Young song)"&gt;Cinnamon Girl&lt;/a&gt;" –  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_%28band%29" title="Loop (band)"&gt;Loop&lt;/a&gt; – 2:50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helpless_%28song%29" title="Helpless (song)"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt;" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cave" title="Nick Cave"&gt;Nick Cave&lt;/a&gt; – 4:32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Soul" title="Mr. Soul"&gt;Mr. Soul&lt;/a&gt;" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongwater_%28band%29" title="Bongwater (band)"&gt;Bongwater&lt;/a&gt; – 3:30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Winterlong" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies" title="Pixies"&gt;Pixies&lt;/a&gt; – 3:11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Age" title="Computer Age" class="mw-redirect"&gt;Computer Age&lt;/a&gt;" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth" title="Sonic Youth"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt; – 5:13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Love_Can_Break_Your_Heart" title="Only Love Can Break Your Heart"&gt;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&lt;/a&gt;" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_TV" title="Psychic TV"&gt;Psychic TV&lt;/a&gt; – 6:08&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotta_Love" title="Lotta Love"&gt;Lotta Love&lt;/a&gt;" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Jr." title="Dinosaur Jr."&gt;Dinosaur Jr.&lt;/a&gt; – 2:41&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Needle_and_the_Damage_Done" title="The Needle and the Damage Done"&gt;The Needle and the Damage Done&lt;/a&gt;"/"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonight%27s_the_Night_%28Neil_Young_album%29" title="Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)"&gt;Tonight's The Night&lt;/a&gt;" – &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kaiser_%28musician%29" title="Henry Kaiser (musician)"&gt;Henry Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; – 5:54&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_My,_Hey_Hey_%28Out_of_the_Blue%29" title="My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)" class="mw-redirect"&gt;My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)&lt;/a&gt;" by B.A.L.L. – 2:16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Words (Between The Lines Of Ages)" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kaiser_%28musician%29" title="Henry Kaiser"&gt;Henry Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; – 6:19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracks 13 and 14 were bonus, CD-only tracks.   Listening to them, it is clear why they did not make the cut for the vinyl or tape version of the LP.  The LP would have been stronger without track 12 as well: Henry Kaiser's medley of "The Needle and the Damage Done" and "Tonight's the Night".  But the worst offender is Victoria Williams providing the guest vocals on "Words", who transforms probably my favorite song from "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_%28album%29"&gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt;" into a shrill, unlistenable wreck of a song.  Her version of "Don't Let it Bring You Down" is not very good, but on "Words" she is just terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the LP provides some truly sublime covers as well, some that arguably transcend the originals.  Soul Asylum's version of "Barstool Blues" is up-tempo and brassy and it captures a type of franticness and desperation missing from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuma_%28album%29"&gt;Zuma&lt;/a&gt;'s more honky-tonk version.  The Pixies do an incredible version of "Winterlong" (released only on the compilation triple LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_%28Neil_Young_album%29"&gt;Decade&lt;/a&gt;").   But Sonic Youth's version of "Computer Age" is the gem of the collection.  Sonic Youth has the ability in their cover songs to both honor the original version and at the same time completely make the song their own (cf. their transformation of the protagonist from helpless victim to stalker in "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstar_%28Carpenters_song%29#Carpenters_version"&gt;Superstar&lt;/a&gt;" on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carpenters"&gt;The Carpenters&lt;/a&gt; tribute LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I_Were_a_Carpenter_%28album%29"&gt;If I Were a Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;").  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAv69KITjdk"&gt;Computer Age&lt;/a&gt;" was released on the above-mentioned "Trans" LP and Sonic Youth &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;constructed it from a puzzling vocoder/disco version it into an amazing song.  I'm a pretty big fan of Sonic Youth, but I'd also love to see them do a covers LP like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_La_Tengo"&gt;Yo La Tengo&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakebook_%28album%29"&gt;Fakebook&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the above three songs are probably my favorite on the LP, Bongwater, Nick Cave, Psychic TV and Dinosaur Jr. all do enjoyable versions of their songs as well (note: Dinosaur Jr. went to great lengths to ensure their version of "Lotta Love" sounds &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt; like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolette_Larson"&gt;Nicolette Larson&lt;/a&gt; version).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5tkLlAOOsY"&gt;Barstool Blues&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWWjMgzhbu4"&gt;Winterlong&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ0cLPSfLrg"&gt;Computer Age&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whhN3Mp-DuE"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG7_Mm-ksTY"&gt;Mr. Soul&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5GZNmR7aDg"&gt;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7UGui1QOSA"&gt;Lotta Love&lt;/a&gt;"  (Not many canonical versions since this LP is not well represented online; I welcome suggestions for additional links).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: "The Needle and the Damage Done"/"Tonight's the Night", "My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)", "Words (Between the Lines of Age)"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 8/10.  This might be the best start-to-finish tribute LP in my collection.</content>

    <title>The Cribs - "Men's Needs"  (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346265+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SeEcXllq0dI/AAAAAAAAAHs/TLa_OAwm8VU/s1600-h/Men%27s_needs_cover.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SeEcXllq0dI/AAAAAAAAAHs/TLa_OAwm8VU/s200/Men%27s_needs_cover.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5323567426081313234" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's been several weeks since I've featured &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt; so its clearly time for another installment.  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_Needs"&gt;Men's Needs&lt;/a&gt;" is the first single and partially the  title track from their third LP, 2007's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-mens-needs-womens-needs-whatever.html"&gt;Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_Recordings"&gt;Wichita Recordings&lt;/a&gt; has posted the censored version  of the video on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCNTYi9fHuo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;; you've probably seen it by now.  (As an aside -- with  respect to YouTube etc., Wichita Recordings completely "gets it".)  But there are also two different versions: one with a digitally added leotard on the woman (instead of strategically placed black bars) and an uncensored version.  The "&lt;a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2007/06/uncensored_nsfw.html"&gt;brooklynvegan&lt;/a&gt;" blog has links to the leotard version (now broken due to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group#Dispute_with_YouTube"&gt;WMG no longer "getting it"&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid979266171"&gt;uncensored version&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/25846808"&gt;new link&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="http://www.mtv.co.uk/the-cribs/videos/mens-needs-dirty-version"&gt;new new link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Nash"&gt;Kate Nash&lt;/a&gt;, the girlfriend (&lt;a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7014209108"&gt;or perhaps wife&lt;/a&gt;, I'm not sure since all the articles I could find are written in future tense) of The Crib's guitarist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jarman"&gt;Ryan Jarman&lt;/a&gt;, has recorded a version of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRW8mVuTTQM"&gt;Men's Needs&lt;/a&gt;.  I believe Nash is more of a presence in the UK and judging from what I've read, her rapid rise to success (her debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_of_Bricks"&gt;Made of Bricks&lt;/a&gt;" went to #1 in the UK) seems to have caused a bit of a backlash.  I'm not familiar with her work, but this version is an enjoyable, slightly folky version of the song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there is the minimalist, even more folky &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l220omLIRvA"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightspeed_Champion"&gt;Lightspeed Champion&lt;/a&gt; (aka Devonte Hynes).   I was also unaware of Lightspeed Champion; apparently he's big in the UK as well.  But not so big that his alternative credentials aren't intact...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When will we see a US band cover a Cribs song?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus link:  "&lt;a href="http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/KtippWHdehA/"&gt;Fairer Sex&lt;/a&gt;" is the B-side to the CD version of the "Men's Needs" single.&amp;nbsp; Live version of "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpyYx1OTttU"&gt;Fairer Sex&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jarman"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

    <title>Husker Du - "New Day Rising" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346278+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sd5muApc0dI/AAAAAAAAAHc/uxCzUr2zlwA/s1600-h/HuskerDuNewDayRising.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5322804750232375762" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sd5muApc0dI/AAAAAAAAAHc/uxCzUr2zlwA/s320/HuskerDuNewDayRising.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 201px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Having already reviewed "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/husker-du-flip-your-wig-lp-review.html"&gt;Flip Your Wig&lt;/a&gt;", it's only right to return to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Day_Rising"&gt;New Day Rising&lt;/a&gt;".  NDR was released in early 1985 and FYW was released in late 1985.  Most bands can go their whole career and never produce an LP of the caliber of NDR or FYW; for Husker Du to release two such LPs in less than a year is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As discussed in the &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/03/husker-du-flip-your-wig-lp-review.html"&gt;FYW review&lt;/a&gt;, NDR finds the band in transition from strictly hardcore punk to punk tempered with conventional pop music structure.  That may sound like damning with faint praise, but it really just means there are strong vocal hooks to go with their blistering sound.  This ain't &lt;a href="http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?contentid=13310"&gt;Gap Punk&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the FYW review, Danette observed that I had not really dealt with the musicians themselves.  Husker Du was a trio, consisting of guitarist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Mould"&gt;Bob Mould&lt;/a&gt;, bassist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norton"&gt;Greg Norton&lt;/a&gt; and drummer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Hart"&gt;Grant Hart&lt;/a&gt;.  Mould and Hart were the principal songwriters.  They occasionally collaborated, but most of the songs are individually written with Hart's contributions slowing increasing with each LP.  Like any good songwriting tandem (e.g., &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon/McCartney"&gt;Lennon/McCartney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagger/Richards"&gt;Jagger/Richards&lt;/a&gt;), there was a great deal of friction and competition between Mould and Hart and it (exacerbated by substance abuse) would eventually &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC#Breakup"&gt;split up the band&lt;/a&gt;.  While Mould would go on to have  a successful post-Husker Du career (both as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Mould#Discography"&gt;solo artist&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_%28band%29#Discography"&gt;Sugar&lt;/a&gt;), Hart's output is more limited (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Hart#Solo_and_Nova_Mob"&gt;solo and as Nova Mob&lt;/a&gt;).  Norton apparently left the music industry altogether.  But neither Mould nor Hart have since equaled their banner year of 1985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I consider FYW to be a slightly better LP than NDR, I would also argue that NDR has better individual songs, even if they don't form the cohesive unit that FYW does listening from start to finish.  Whereas FYW has "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1sYN0PuRs4"&gt;Makes No Sense At All&lt;/a&gt;", NDR has the title track "New Day Rising", "I Apologize", "Folk Lore", "Celebrated Summer" and "59 Times the Pain" that are all nearly as good as "Makes No Sense At All".  The title track proves that it is possible to write an amazing song whose lyrics consist of simply repeating three words: "new day rising..."  Listen to it and you'll be hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why I give FYW the nod over NDR is because tracks like "Perfect Example", "Powerline" and "How To Skin A Cat" are easily forgettable.  The latter is punk/psychedelic noodling (in comparison, "Plans I Make" or the "Dreams Reoccurring"/"Reoccurring Dreams" pair from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Arcade"&gt;Zen Arcade&lt;/a&gt; are better examples of the sound they were after).  The former two songs are not really bad, but they're not really good either.  They're just there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random observation #1:  The LP cover art surely has to be in the top 10 of all time.  The cover captures the feel of the songs in a way I can't put in words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random observation #2: Yes, they have modish &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_umlaut"&gt;heavy metal umlauts&lt;/a&gt; over the "u"s in their name.  They formed in 1979 and that's just how things were done then.  The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%ABsker_D%C5%AB%3F"&gt;board game&lt;/a&gt; from which they took their name has macrons instead of umlauts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout Tracks: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZTBsLcl98"&gt;New Day Rising&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sIeIcOo4rg"&gt;I Apologize&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O910x1Hrjt8"&gt;Folk Lore&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtCL1xq6hNU"&gt;Celebrated Summer&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUhl8VV5FUQ"&gt;59 Times the Pain&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLKYngRjbQc"&gt;Books About UFOs&lt;/a&gt;"; the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29TJbZmHUgo"&gt;full LP in a single video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em Tracks: "Perfect Example", "Powerline" and "How To Skin A Cat"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10.  I thought about giving them a 9/10 because of the three weakest tracks, but  the strength of the other tracks makes up for those three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  YouTube user &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SUICIDEVOM"&gt;SUICIDEVOM&lt;/a&gt; has uploaded a "New Day Rising"-era concert in seven parts: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MtiVbkfUn4"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHmCc9XUaxA"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-lpOyo5Ce0"&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY_LxJBX7z8"&gt;part 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aXrew70Qas"&gt;part 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5wybDkyQoA"&gt;part 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP1XwlWOoR0"&gt;part 7&lt;/a&gt;.  The sound quality is good and it is well worth checking out.</content>

    <title>Dag Nasty - "Wig Out at Denko's" (forgotten song) (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346291+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ScveDR-n-WI/AAAAAAAAAHU/8U7CKSxkALc/s1600-h/Wigoutat.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ScveDR-n-WI/AAAAAAAAAHU/8U7CKSxkALc/s320/Wigoutat.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5317587932988045666" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 147px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 150px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wig_Out_at_Denko%27s"&gt;Wig Out at Denko's&lt;/a&gt;" is the title track from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_Nasty"&gt;Dag Nasty&lt;/a&gt;'s 2nd LP, which was released in 1987.  Dag Nasty went through several incarnations and was composed of members from several other contemporary &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk"&gt;hardcore punk&lt;/a&gt; bands.  Rather than list them all, it is is simpler to say that their records were released on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_MacKaye"&gt;Ian Mackaye&lt;/a&gt;'s (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Threat"&gt;Minor Threat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugazi"&gt;Fugazi&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dischord_Records"&gt;Dischord Records&lt;/a&gt;, thus placing them squarely in the Washington DC / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_punk_ethic#Punk_culture"&gt;DIY&lt;/a&gt; milieu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, I first heard this song as covered by Tone Deaf.  Tone Deaf was a band composed of many of my good friends at &lt;a href="http://denbigh.nn.k12.va.us/"&gt;Denbigh High School&lt;/a&gt; in the mid/late 1980s.  They did mostly contemporary popular covers, but they also did a few originals and some obscure covers as well.  I won't even pretend to be impartial, but toward the end (summer 88?) they were actually pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The garage rock scene was pretty healthy in the mid 80s at Denbigh, so the guitar class teacher had an annual "Denbigh Jam" which provided a showcase for the various high school bands.  It was not a typical "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bands"&gt;battle of the bands&lt;/a&gt;" per se (I don't recall any awards), but participation was competitive: there were try outs and if you didn't have your stuff together you didn't get a slot.  Some Denbigh Jam alumni that went professional include members of: &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/buttsteakmusic"&gt;buttsteak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/fanoffalsesacrament"&gt;False Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/godanny"&gt;Danny Godinez&lt;/a&gt;, Gregg Brooks and Nocturnal Zoo.  I may have forgotten some notable bands/musicians and I welcome any additions or corrections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link provided below is of Tone Deaf, mk. II:  Fred Moore (vocals, keyboards), &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=539787122"&gt;Terry Harrison&lt;/a&gt; (rhythm guitar, vocals), &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1314586"&gt;Drew Munro&lt;/a&gt; (lead guitar), &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1119784799"&gt;Art Everett&lt;/a&gt; (bass) and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1311798158"&gt;Chris Everton&lt;/a&gt; (drums).  They're performing at Denbigh Jam '88, which I believe was in the fall.&lt;br /&gt;Terry (the guitarist in the foreground) has a mountain of HS &amp;amp; college-era video tapes that he's slowly processing and putting on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheTerryHarrison"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  Tone Deaf's cover of "Wig Out at Denko's" is one of the gems he's put online so far.  And although this makes me a complete homer, I think you'll find Tone Deaf's faster tempo version more enjoyable than the slower, studio version.  And while Tone Deaf might not be a trip down memory lane for you, "Wig Out at Denko's" is a great song that deserves a listen regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dag Nasty: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fGUzZk1U7g"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (studio version), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HysC5CcMUok#t=24m40s"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (live version, skip to about 24:40 -- it's the last song of the set).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tone Deaf: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGAjII2LTwY"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The live Dag Nasty version comes from "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BlankTV"&gt;Blank TV&lt;/a&gt;" -- if you like punk and related genres, you should check them out.</content>

    <title>Husker Du - "Flip Your Wig" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346304+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ScO1AFWDs_I/AAAAAAAAAHM/SSUCLPyorNU/s1600-h/Huskerdu_flipyourwig.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5315290998266639346" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ScO1AFWDs_I/AAAAAAAAAHM/SSUCLPyorNU/s320/Huskerdu_flipyourwig.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Your_Wig"&gt;Flip Your Wig&lt;/a&gt;" is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt;'s final LP on the seminal alternative label &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SST_Records"&gt;SST Records&lt;/a&gt; (if you listened to alternative music in the early- mid-80s, you had a lot of SST releases and respected them -- until 1987  when &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Use:_The_Story_of_the_Letter_U_and_the_Numeral_2"&gt;SST rolled over on Negativland&lt;/a&gt;, but that is a story for another time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flip Your Wig is actually the second LP Husker Du released in 1985; earlier that year they released "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Day_Rising"&gt;New Day Rising&lt;/a&gt;" and in 1984 they had put the world on notice with their double LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Arcade"&gt;Zen Arcade&lt;/a&gt;".  Conventional wisdom says that their best LP is Zen Arcade, closely followed by New Day Rising.  To me, Zen Arcade is an &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;important&lt;/span&gt; LP with some quite good songs.  New Day Rising is an exceptional LP, marred only by a few self-indulgent songs (e.g., "How To Skin a Cat").  But Flip Your Wig represents the band at its zenith: the right combination of punk power (slowing maturing since 1981's nearly unlistenable "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2012/07/husker-du-land-speed-record-lp-review.html"&gt;Land Speed Record&lt;/a&gt;") and pop sensibilities (the first glimpses of which we saw on 1983's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Circus"&gt;Metal Circus&lt;/a&gt;" EP) .  Their last two studio LPs on Warner Brothers, while not entirely bad (too much pop and not nearly enough punk), simply can't compare to their SST releases.  But for Flip Your Wig, it all came together in an LP that features great songs, furious power, and an LP that is easy to listen to start to finish.  Yes, the production quality is thin, but that was par for the course in the mid 80s.  Their major label releases had "better" production which ultimately makes for a less enjoyable listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be easier to list the songs on this LP that are not great:  "The Baby Song".  That's it.  That's the only song you'll skip on this whole LP.  And it's not even a song, it's just 47 seconds of  silly slide whistle filler.  Maybe it seemed funny at the time, maybe they did it on a dare.  Past that, there are only two kinds of songs on this LP: excellent and mind-blowingly excellent.  I'll only list the latter below.  If forced to pick a single song, "Makes No Sense At All" is probably the best punk anthem ever recorded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7rFj-l7YN4"&gt;Flip Your Wig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1sYN0PuRs4"&gt;Makes No Sense At All&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMmksjQwE88"&gt;Green Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSqZGTNrPi8"&gt;Divide and Conquer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-NTITiQOos"&gt;Flexible Flyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a14HjVs56Tg"&gt;Private Plane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-CJhvHnLpk"&gt;The Wit and the Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: The Baby Song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Score: 10/10.</content>

    <title>The Cribs - "Arigato Cockers" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346318+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ScGjhbHcjyI/AAAAAAAAAHE/bme9wWxry9w/s1600-h/cribs-arigato-cockers.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/ScGjhbHcjyI/AAAAAAAAAHE/bme9wWxry9w/s320/cribs-arigato-cockers.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5314708829883895586" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-Arigato-Cockers/release/874995"&gt;Arigato Cockers&lt;/a&gt;" is a 2006 Japanese-only EP from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt;.  It is essentially the non-LP single "You're Gonna Lose Us" with several B-sides collected from earlier singles.   Yes, my obsession with this band has reached the point where I'm buying imports and singles just to be a completist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been nearly two years since I first heard them and I still don't know why they are not more popular than they are. I'm doing my part; they're in heavy rotation in my cd player &amp;amp; iPod and I talk about them incessantly to anyone that will listen.  While they're not exactly unknown, I don't understand why bands like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay"&gt;Coldplay&lt;/a&gt; (y-a-w-n) become huge and The Cribs have not.  Or at least not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while we await release of new material from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Marr#The_Cribs_.282008-present.29"&gt;Johnny Marr version of The Cribs&lt;/a&gt;, I'm forced to review a collection of B-sides, demos, covers, outtakes, etc.  "You're Gonna Lose Us" is an excellent song, deserving of A-side single status.  Recorded in 2005, it sounds like it was recorded (or at least written) for &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-new-fellas-lp-review.html"&gt;The New Fellas&lt;/a&gt; sessions (although the producer, engineer, etc. information according to &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Cribs%2C+The"&gt;Discogs&lt;/a&gt; doesn't support this theory).  This song alone is worth the price of the EP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Saturday Night Facts of Life" is a cover of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Gain"&gt;Comet Gain&lt;/a&gt; song (the original can be found at &lt;a href="http://mp3.rhapsody.com/comet-gain/tigertown-pictures/saturday-night-facts-of-life"&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;).  The excellent "Advice From a Roving Artist" also features Comet Gain's bassist, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/jonslade"&gt;Jon Slade&lt;/a&gt;; it sounds similar to (even better than?) "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcMKpKW1bwk"&gt;Be Safe&lt;/a&gt;" from "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-mens-needs-womens-needs-whatever.html"&gt;Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever&lt;/a&gt;".  The other tracks ("&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRom1J2Omqg"&gt;It Happened So Fast&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ_itBApUf0"&gt;Feelin' It!&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQniYz3CBoA"&gt;To Jackson&lt;/a&gt;") would be great songs for nearly any band &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; than The Cribs.  But in The Crib's canon, they're merely middle of the road songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks:  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJDDwaIPHoM"&gt;You're Gonna Lose Us&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU8_XIQj9ZI"&gt;Advice From a Roving Artist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0SZUMy714w"&gt;Saturday Night Facts of Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Final score: 7/10.  That's a little bit unfair since this really isn't an LP; it's an EP that is really a single plus a grab bag of B-sides, but  the score reflects that "Arigato Cockers" is not where casual fans of the band should begin.  If you treat it as just a single + 5 bonus tracks then it rates much higher.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 8/10.  I'm not sure what I was thinking when I wrote it, but I have to revise my earlier rating.  The itunes play counts don't lie: this is a really good EP.</content>

    <title>The Rentals - "Friends of P" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346331+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SbSAIvwTUqI/AAAAAAAAAG8/CxHLvp3Cxy8/s1600-h/friendsofpcover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SbSAIvwTUqI/AAAAAAAAAG8/CxHLvp3Cxy8/s400/friendsofpcover.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5311010748323025570" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"Friends of P" was a huge hit in the mid 1990s and shortly after that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rentals"&gt;The Rentals&lt;/a&gt; pretty much disappeared.  This was the first single of their 1995 debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_Of_%28The_Rentals%29"&gt;Return of The Rentals&lt;/a&gt;".   You are probably asking yourself "why do they sound so much like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer"&gt;Weezer&lt;/a&gt;?" One reason is because The Rentals were a side project involving Weezer bassist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Sharp"&gt;Matt Sharp&lt;/a&gt; and drummer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Wilson_%28musician%29"&gt;Patrick Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and this LP was recorded in between the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_%281994_album%29"&gt;first Weezer LP&lt;/a&gt; and their 2nd LP, &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/02/weezer-pinkerton-lp-review.html"&gt;Pinkerton&lt;/a&gt;.  Matt Sharp left Weezer after Pinkerton but Patrick Wilson continued on with Weezer instead of The Rentals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason why it sounds so similar is because &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Ocasek"&gt;Ric Ocasek&lt;/a&gt; produced both the first Weezer LP and Return of the Rentals.  In fact, the addition of female singers and keyboards places The Rentals more in line with the pop sound of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cars"&gt;The Cars&lt;/a&gt; than Weezer's more garage rock sound.  The other thing that Ocasek brings to this song is his wife, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulina_Porizkova"&gt;Paulina Porizkova&lt;/a&gt; -- the "P" in "Friends of P".  The &lt;a href="http://www.realitytvworld.com/realitytvdb/paulina-porizkova/biography"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; goes that Porizkova, an avid palm reader, was lamenting that "nobody cool was writing songs about her now".  So apparently Sharp stepped up and wrote this enjoyable and quirky tribute to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several line up changes and a hiatus, The Rentals are active again.  I should search out their new material to give it a listen.  Until then, revisiting their hit single will have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Links: &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/videos/the-rentals/58801/friends-of-p.jhtml"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cSb6-i0dX8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaPUmCjhiCA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  The first YouTube video is a live version on a French TV show (ca. 95-96) and I believe that is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Rudolph"&gt;Maya Rudolph&lt;/a&gt; on keyboards (she toured with the band but did not record or appear in the studio video).  The video does not appear to have either &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Haden"&gt;Rachel Haden&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra_Haden"&gt;Petra Haden&lt;/a&gt;.  The second YouTube version is fan video featuring the lyrics.</content>

    <title>The Band - "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346344+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Say_wFd11UI/AAAAAAAAAG0/N2sQIjk0cxw/s1600-h/the-band-tntdodd.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 209px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Say_wFd11UI/AAAAAAAAAG0/N2sQIjk0cxw/s320/the-band-tntdodd.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5308828893584938306" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_They_Drove_Old_Dixie_Down"&gt;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&lt;/a&gt;" is a song about the conclusion and aftermath of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.  At first it seems ironic that it was written by Canadian &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Robertson"&gt;Robbie Robertson&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band"&gt;The Band&lt;/a&gt;, but upon further reflection perhaps the song makes the kinds of observations that can only be written by an outsider.  The genius of this song is that it captures the pathos and mythology of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy"&gt;lost cause&lt;/a&gt; and transforms it from a polarizing political statement to a universally applicable personal account of suffering, loss and resignation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The song tells the story of the fictional Virgil Caine, who "served on the Danville Train / 'til Stoneman's calvary came / and they tore up the tracks again".  After the war, Virgil is paroled to his agrarian life in Tennessee and reflects upon the war ("In the winter of '65 / We were hungry, just barely alive / By May 10th, Richmond had fell / It was a time I remember oh so well") and the loss of his brother  ("Like my father before me, I will work the land / Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand / He was just 18, proud and brave / But a Yankee laid him in his grave").  Virgil is a guileless man and makes sense of his current state in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era_%28United_States%29"&gt;reconstruction-era&lt;/a&gt; Tennessee with "I don't mind chopping wood / And I don't care if the money's no good / You take what you need and you leave the rest / But they should never have taken the very best".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The song has been covered by many folk, country and southern rock artists and given the subject matter, combinations of those genres might be the only versions we will hear.  Although it was first released on The Band's 1969 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band_%28album%29"&gt;eponymous second LP&lt;/a&gt;, the most popular version might be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez"&gt;Joan Baez&lt;/a&gt;'s 1971 hit from her &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Are..."&gt;Blessed Are...&lt;/a&gt; LP.  Interestingly enough, Baez &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_They_Drove_Old_Dixie_Down#Covers_of_song"&gt;changed the lyrics&lt;/a&gt; due to mis-hearing them on The Band's recording.  Some of the changes have minimal effect: "'til Stoneman's Calvary came" became "'til so much calvary came", "There goes the Robert E. Lee" (a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee_%28steamboat%29"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;) became "There goes Robert E. Lee" (the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Edward_Lee"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt;; the distinction would change the time frame of the story), "I will work the land" became "I'm a working man".  But one of her changes I consider more powerful than the original:  "I swear by the mud below my feet / You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat" she changed to "I swear by the blood below my feet / You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat".   The result is, similar to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_music#Variation_in_traditional_music"&gt;traditional music&lt;/a&gt;,  every cover version has some permutation of Robertson's and Baez's lyrics; even Baez's versions change over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list below has most of the important versions, but it should not be considered a complete list.  And despite that they are all arranged more or less the same, each versions find a different nuance to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Band:  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOTNQF-o_mQ"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  The previous link is to the studio version, but it is hard to compete with the version from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese"&gt;Scorcese&lt;/a&gt;'s movie &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Waltz"&gt;The Last Waltz&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jREUrbGGrgM"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.kewego.com/video/iLyROoaftmKI.html"&gt;Kewego&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joan Baez: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnS9M03F-fA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=2&amp;amp;q=http://www.last.fm/music/Joan%2BBaez/_/The%2BNight%2BThey%2BDrove%2BOld%2BDixie%2BDown&amp;amp;ei=6bmsSdT6CoyRngfuzuW_Bg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFaqA4llqRgsyUymh7ymf0DfebJQA"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.  The YouTube version is from what I assume is a contemporary TV show; it showcases her version of the lyrics nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1bZGtJTT-A"&gt;YouTube1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Xk8Cp09aM"&gt;YouTube2&lt;/a&gt;.   The first version is a studio recording; I'm not sure which LP but the backing vocals make me guess mid 70s.  The second version is not a complete song, but was taken from a TV show.  I wish there were a complete version of Cash doing the song in this style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Crowes"&gt;The Black Crowes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdVhIbiIBC0"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm not really a big fan of The Black Crowes, but they do a great arrangement of this song that is reminiscent of The Last Waltz version by The Band.  From their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_%27n%27_Roll_into_the_Fog"&gt;2005 DVD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Hart"&gt;Clay Hart&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K15vdTDNx_Y"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  This is probably the only &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawrence_Welk_Show"&gt;Lawrence Welk Show&lt;/a&gt; clip you'll see covered on &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/"&gt;F-Measure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia_Band"&gt;Jerry Garcia Band&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcu0aDy_mtY"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  S-l-o-w-e-d w-a-y d-o-w-n.  This version claims to be from a 1975 show; you can also find a live version on their 1990 double &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia_Band_%28album%29"&gt;eponymous LP&lt;/a&gt;.  This is probably the most non-standard arrangement listed, but I quite like it.</content>

    <title>Pink Floyd - "An Hour With Pink Floyd (KQED)" (concert)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346357+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SZ8_DyVCREI/AAAAAAAAAGU/CzEgHrdKSxI/s1600-h/pink-floyd-kqed.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5305028220347892802" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SZ8_DyVCREI/AAAAAAAAAGU/CzEgHrdKSxI/s200/pink-floyd-kqed.png" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 167px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I found this gem while researching the &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/02/roger-waters-pros-and-cons-of-hitch.html"&gt;Roger Waters review&lt;/a&gt; below.   I've labeled it as an "LP Review", but that is not quite accurate.  Apparently on April 29, 1970, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KQED_%28TV%29"&gt;KQED&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco recorded a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt; show and broadcast it.  I don't know much more than that.  I'm of the impression that the show was done especially for KQED, but I'm not certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always enjoyed their 1971 recording (1972  release) "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/11/pink-floyd-live-at-pompeii-concert.html"&gt;Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii&lt;/a&gt;", and this is certainly similar.  While "Pompeii" features several tracks from the LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meddle"&gt;Meddle&lt;/a&gt;", "KQED" features two from "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack_from_the_Film_More"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;",  one from "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_Heart_Mother"&gt;Atom Heart Mother&lt;/a&gt;" and one from "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummagumma"&gt;Ummagumma&lt;/a&gt;".   I happened to find this because I was considering reviewing "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymbaline"&gt;Cymbaline&lt;/a&gt;" as a "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/forgotten%20song"&gt;forgotten song&lt;/a&gt;".  The &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLw0C7CvL_8"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt; is nice, but the live version is amazing -- a must listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been unable to find a DVD bootleg of the concert (I would get it just for "Cymbaline"), but there are various portions on the web.  YouTube user "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FranksValli"&gt;FranksValli&lt;/a&gt;" has kindly split the concert into nine pieces.  The track listing, with YouTube links, for "KQED" is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0. (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXS_lk9mg8w"&gt;Intro&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;1.  Atom Heart Mother (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZicR4UCAp_4"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdyvN3xcVmc"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVxCZbj7Ya4"&gt;Cymbaline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er-I6hdghYk"&gt;Granchester Meadows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQChZ52yzTo"&gt;Green Is The Colour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsBUWD5r2o"&gt;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun  (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJrK3eRwahI"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoxAlVaQ6m0"&gt;part2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracks 5 &amp;amp; 6 are arranged similar to the "Pompeii" release.  Two blogs, "&lt;a href="http://musicgraveyard.blogspot.com/2008/08/pink-floyd-kqed-tv-studios-1970-dvd.html"&gt;Palace of Exile&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://clandestinesoundlab.blogspot.com/2007/12/pink-floyd-kqed-1970.html"&gt;Clandestine Sound Lab&lt;/a&gt;" provide URLs for getting the videos directly.  I'm still hoping for someone to make a nice &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleg_recording"&gt;bootleg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2009-12-01 edit: the YouTube account hosting the above links is suspended and the videos deleted, but you can still find the entire video at &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6405376625737312652#"&gt;Google Videos&lt;/a&gt;.  And I did find a bootleg DVD for sale, but the &lt;a href="http://www.stellarproducts.biz/piflli19atkq.html"&gt;URL is now defunct&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2010-06-17 edit: I've been able to find new YT links for all but "Intro" and "Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun".  The old links have been left intact.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2011-11-08 edit: Here is the entire concert in a single &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6lBobiH-Ks"&gt;YouTube link&lt;/a&gt;.  We'll see how long this one lasts...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2013-02-15 edit: here's another upload of the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9biTCMnrV8"&gt;entire concert&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013-11-04 edit:&amp;nbsp; I think all of the above links have been removed, so here's a version on &lt;a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xq2bn6_an-hour-with-pink-floyd-complete-1970-aired-by-kqed_music"&gt;Dailymotion&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If only KQED/PF/whomever focused their energies into releasing an official version instead of just removing the unofficial versions from the web...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I'm removing this from the "LP Review" category and retroactively putting it in the category of "concert".&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since I labeled this as an "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/LP%20review"&gt;LP review&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: All, but especially "Cymbaline".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final rating: 10/10. &lt;/del&gt;</content>

    <title>Roger Waters - "The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346371+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SZ2PKF8DtjI/AAAAAAAAAGM/cNyJtRQFBhg/s1600-h/Roger_Waters_Pros_Cons_HH.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SZ2PKF8DtjI/AAAAAAAAAGM/cNyJtRQFBhg/s200/Roger_Waters_Pros_Cons_HH.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304553339667854898" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My friend Terry and I belong to a very exclusive club: we believe "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pros_and_Cons_of_Hitch_Hiking"&gt;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&lt;/a&gt;" is an amazing LP.   Most people just see the neurotic excess of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters"&gt;Roger Waters&lt;/a&gt; without the balancing influence of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour"&gt;David Gilmour&lt;/a&gt;.  I see that as well, but I also see this LP as a successful completion of the ideas introduced in "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall"&gt;The Wall&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Cut_%28album%29"&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/a&gt;" (example: in the movie "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd_The_Wall_%28film%29"&gt;The Wall&lt;/a&gt;", Pink is reciting the lyrics to "Moment of Clarity" in the scene in the bathroom stall).  This LP is arguably better since the the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_%28narrative_mode%29"&gt;stream of consciousness&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming"&gt;lucid dreaming&lt;/a&gt; format better suits Water's story telling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Released in 1984, TPACOHH is Roger Water's first solo LP (not counting 1970's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_from_The_Body"&gt;Music From the Body&lt;/a&gt;" as a proper solo LP) and was released near the end of his membership in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd#Roger_Waters-led_era:_1976.E2.80.931985"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;.  Joining Waters on this LP are a host of excellent musicians, including &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sanborn"&gt;David Sanborn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton"&gt;Eric Clapton&lt;/a&gt;.  Much like the previous two Pink Floyd LPs, this one is best enjoyed with the volume way up and/or with headphones since various special effects (e.g., the sound of the Lamborghini in the 2nd track) and subtle plot cues are provided in the background (e.g., "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_%28film%29"&gt;and mother wants you!&lt;/a&gt;").  The LP only featured one single that received even tiniest bit of airplay  (track 10, "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6_-dmrUVwE"&gt;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&lt;/a&gt;").  Also like the previous two Pink Floyd LPs, the songs out of context won't necessarily make a lot of sense.  By itself, the single is about people you meet hitch hiking.  But that's not really what the song (or LP) is about... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waters has a &lt;a href="http://www.rogerwaters.org/Pros.html"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; on his web site, but I'll attempt an even shorter version.  A husband is lying in bed late at night and has a dream about leaving his wife for a hitch hiker he picks up and after a brief encounter the hitch hiker is gone.  He moves to Wyoming and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-grid"&gt;lives off the grid&lt;/a&gt; with his wife who ultimately leaves him for another man.  Despondent, he becomes a hitch hiker himself and has a cathartic journey as he makes his way back to civilization.  He finally wakes up  and has a  "moment of clarity"  and realizes he's happy despite his dream state &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-life_crisis"&gt;mid-life crisis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To emphasize the dream sequence, the tracks are actually titled 4:30 AM (Apparently They Were Travelling Abroad), 4:33 AM (Running Shoes), 4:37 AM (Arabs with Knives and West German Skies), etc.   The times correspond to the length of the song, and the parenthetical titles give an indication as to general theme.  Its hard to pick favorite songs from this LP, but if forced to do so I would choose "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGEnJA-zk6Y"&gt;Running Shoes&lt;/a&gt;" ("Fixed on the front of her Fassbinder face / Was the kind of a smile / That only a rather dull child could have drawn / While attempting a graveyard in the moonlight"), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MheMn-AUvQA"&gt;Sexual Revolution&lt;/a&gt;" ("I woke in a fever / The bedclothes were all soaked in sweat /  She said `You've been having a nightmare /And it's not over yet'") and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ3KtCHnEbo"&gt;Go Fishing&lt;/a&gt;" ("F*** it then / Take the kids back to town / Maybe I'll see you around"). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't heard this LP (or haven't listened to it in some time), I encourage you to give it a try.  Ultimately, this was the last important LP by Roger Waters.  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_K.A.O.S."&gt;Radio K.A.O.S&lt;/a&gt;" was a decent LP with a few good songs, but it does not begin to approach TPACOHH.  Ditto the Water-less Pink Floyd LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Momentary_Lapse_of_Reason"&gt;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&lt;/a&gt;" released a few years later.  "The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking" is the last great LP from any member of Pink Floyd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout songs:  All.  Ok, that's a cop out (and some songs are linked to above), but you really should listen to the whole thing: &lt;a href="http://grooveshark.com/album/The+Pros+And+Cons+Of+Hitch+Hiking/2361599"&gt;grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Roger+Waters/The+Pros+and+Cons+of+Hitch+Hiking"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/roger-waters/the-pros-cons-of-hitch-hiking"&gt;Rhapsody.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBgzpKDUG-A"&gt;Full LP on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em songs: none. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final rating: 10/10. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  YouTube user "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/gravesing"&gt;gravesing&lt;/a&gt;" has released animated movie versions of the first four songs:  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6wXcINoHIE"&gt;4:30 AM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1A7x4nizKM"&gt;4:33 AM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3rT4kkU4Os"&gt;4:37 AM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3Y1lx35dCs"&gt;4:39 AM&lt;/a&gt;.  They are simultaneously pretty cool and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley"&gt;slightly disturbing&lt;/a&gt;.  Hopefully other installments are forthcoming.  2010-11-29 edit: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os8GDp2rP8o"&gt;4:41 AM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uefNuxr3WCc"&gt;4:47 AM&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Schon &amp; Hammer - "No More Lies" (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346385+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SZD5ka1yT1I/AAAAAAAAAFU/wVn96q66H2w/s1600-h/jan-hammer.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 181px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SZD5ka1yT1I/AAAAAAAAAFU/wVn96q66H2w/s200/jan-hammer.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5301011165490597714" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once again we return to the realm of forgotten videos from the early days of MTV.  Schon &amp;amp; Hammer was a collaboration between &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Schon"&gt;Neil Schon&lt;/a&gt; (lead guitarist for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_%28band%29"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hammer"&gt;Jan Hammer&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Miami_Vice_soundtracks#Miami_Vice_I"&gt;Miami Vice Theme&lt;/a&gt; fame).  "No More Lies" is the first song on their second (and final) studio LP, 1982's ironically titled "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_to_Stay_%28Schon_%26_Hammer_album%29"&gt;Here to Stay&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The song is ok with a decent hook, but it's at best a guilty pleasure.  But there are several larger issues that make this fun to revisit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The video is a perfect early 80s time capsule and seems to come from one of the 4-5 video "templates" available at the time.  For example, watch the video, then watch Ric Ocasek's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/ric-ocasek-something-to-grab-for.html"&gt;Something to Grab For&lt;/a&gt;".   The resemblance is uncanny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  You have to love that 1982 was a time when Jan Hammer -- bald, mid-30s, and remarkably unsexy, could be &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;featured&lt;/span&gt; in the video (as the image above captures).  Neil struts around giving the viewer some beefcake, but it is as if neither Jan nor the video producer noticed that Jan doesn't look like Neil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Finally, this is a perfect example of a common phenomena: a hard rock / heavy metal guitarist trapped in "pop" band.  Listening to Neil Schon solo during Journey songs, I always got the feeling that while he knew his current gig was paying the bills, he really just wanted to shred.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Richrath"&gt;Gary Richrath&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REO_Speedwagon"&gt;REO Speedwagon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Shaw"&gt;Tommy Shaw&lt;/a&gt;* of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx_%28band%29"&gt;Styx&lt;/a&gt; are two other prominent examples.  The ballads sell, but they don't rock.  "No More Lies" rocks a little harder than your average Journey song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall seeing this on MTV just a couple of times.  And while it was hardly a staple (few probably remember it at all), it is interesting how sometimes the lesser known examples actually produce more nostalgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5uCKz7eCLU"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* "&lt;a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51408/episode_about.jhtml"&gt;`But Kilroy -- what about the young people?'  ... I'm going to die in Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51408/episode_about.jhtml"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;"</content>

    <title>Weezer - "Pinkerton" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346398+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SYptCALRN2I/AAAAAAAAAFE/QNOvKeHy8mo/s1600-h/598px-Pinkerton_cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SYptCALRN2I/AAAAAAAAAFE/QNOvKeHy8mo/s200/598px-Pinkerton_cover.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5299167792729241442" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm a big fan of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer"&gt;Weezer&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, it is written somewhere that Weezer fans have to think &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkerton_%28album%29"&gt;Pinkerton&lt;/a&gt; is Weezer's greatest LP of all time, no discussion necessary.  Problem is,  I  don't think this is their best LP.  It might only be their third or fourth best LP.  Those kinds of heretical statements will get you excommunicated from the Weezer fan club pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Released in 1996, Pinkerton is their second LP and represents a decided break from their first LP ("&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_%281994_album%29"&gt;the blue album&lt;/a&gt;") with a heavier, darker sound.   Pinkerton has none of the highly polished power pop songs (and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Jonze"&gt;Spike Jonez&lt;/a&gt; -directed "novelty" videos like "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqgN0T6f1kg"&gt;Undone - the Sweater Song&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiIC5qcXeNU"&gt;Buddy Holly&lt;/a&gt;") that made their first LP such a popular and critical success.  Where their first LP had the  clean precision of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Ocasek"&gt;Ric Ocasek&lt;/a&gt; as producer, Pinkerton is self-produced and, perhaps, more self-indulgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two well-known facts about this LP should give you pause: 1) Pinkerton is the remnants of an unreleased concept LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_from_the_Black_Hole"&gt;Songs from the Black Hole&lt;/a&gt;", which is described as a "space-themed rock opera" and whose legend inevitably invites comparisons to "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_%28Beach_Boys_album%29"&gt;Smile&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys"&gt;The Beach Boys'&lt;/a&gt; mythic unreleased LP, and 2) Pinkerton is roughly inspired by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini"&gt;Puccini's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Butterfly"&gt;Madame Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of being a Lieutenant in the US Navy, the character of Pinkerton is college-age rock star (in other words, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_Cuomo"&gt;Rivers Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;).  That's an awful lot of "concept" for a college rock band ca. mid-90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'll forgive the Madame Butterfly inspiration (if you catch me on a good day I might admit to liking it), but what ultimately limits this LP is that the song writing is not up to their usual standards.  Songs like "Tired of Sex", "Getchoo" and "Falling for You" are &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;nearly&lt;/span&gt; brilliant, but are missing that undefinable something that typifies their earlier -- and later -- songs.  Don't get me wrong, they're good songs, but they come across as incomplete demos and not fully polished.  It is almost as if in their desire to make "heavier" songs, they've left something out.  I can't exactly say what is missing, but it's missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this LP does contain two of their best songs ever: "Good Life" and "Pink Triangle".  The latter is a song of our main character's unrequited love for a woman who turns out to be lesbian and features two of the cleverest lyrics you'll ever hear: "We were good as married in my mind / But married in my mind's no good" and "Everyone's a little queer / Can't she be a little straight".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you listen to the other songs on the LP in light of "Good Life" and "Pink Triangle", you can't help but feel a little disappointed and wonder how good this LP would truly have been if they had all been at that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand out tracks:  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkroIXktjgE"&gt;Good Life&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjy3XbxMW1A"&gt;Pink Triangle&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZKKWCdlauA"&gt;Tired of Sex&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QDkrz6o3wU"&gt;No Other One&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYxc-LLoCk"&gt;Why Bother&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CEqVTWo4EI"&gt;El Scorcho&lt;/a&gt;" (a fan favorite, but I can't get into it), "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiCNjzIhQN8"&gt;Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;" (not a bad song and it resolves the concept, but I often turn the LP off at this point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 8/10 -- narrowly avoiding a 7/10 on the strength of "GL" &amp;amp; "PT".</content>

    <title>The Connells - "Scotty's Lament"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346411+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3W2Ejz88I/AAAAAAAAALA/lvwcX7LTZw8/s1600-h/connells.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 147px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3W2Ejz88I/AAAAAAAAALA/lvwcX7LTZw8/s200/connells.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5363178955693355970" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Connells"&gt;The Connells&lt;/a&gt; were a band from Raleigh NC that had a string of minor hits from the mid 80s to early 90s.  Their biggest hit was probably 1989's "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxSzJYsaqAE"&gt;Fun &amp;amp; Games&lt;/a&gt;", and while that is a great song the rest of their work should not be overlooked.  Unfortunately, nearly their &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Connells,+The"&gt;entire catalog&lt;/a&gt; is owned by the now defunct &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVT_Records"&gt;TVT Records&lt;/a&gt;.  As a result, their LPs are out of print and their songs are not available through outlets like iTunes.  The &lt;a href="http://www.theconnells.com/"&gt;band's website&lt;/a&gt; gives some information about their catalog's status and is hopeful that the LPs will be reissued on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rykodisc"&gt;Ryko&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band's sound was squarely in the mid 80s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rock"&gt;college radio&lt;/a&gt; scene, with a bit of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds"&gt;Byrds&lt;/a&gt;-like, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jangle_pop"&gt;jangly sound&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of both guitarists often playing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickenbacker_360/12"&gt;12 string Rickenbackers&lt;/a&gt;.  "Scotty's Lament", the first song on their 1987 LP "&lt;a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/the-connells/boylan-heights"&gt;Boylan Heights&lt;/a&gt;", is probably my favorite song by The Connells in part because of its great chorus and the contrast between lead and backing vocals.  You can't listen to this song and not sing along.  The song is a lyrical tour de force as well: "I delight in my despair" -- you'd be hard pressed to come up with a better five word summary of the entire genre*.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smith_%28musician%29"&gt;Robert Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey"&gt;Morrissey&lt;/a&gt; should be proud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite some success at the time, The Connells are probably less well known today than some of their contemporaries.  Having their catalog embroiled in a legal dispute clearly does not help.  Here's hoping that situation is resolved and The Connells regain their due recognition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Links: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKSg3zFB2dE"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/goto?rcid=tra.2636894"&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Honorable mention: "Robert Smith is still sad" -- &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Loder"&gt;Kurt Loder&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Blacktask - "Blacktask" (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346424+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3XQx0FM5I/AAAAAAAAALI/EAn-SYF14ww/s1600-h/BlackTask.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3XQx0FM5I/AAAAAAAAALI/EAn-SYF14ww/s200/BlackTask.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5363179414517789586" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This one goes out to my friend Scott, who was extremely well connected in the mid 80s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_trading"&gt;demo tape trading&lt;/a&gt; scene when we were in high school.  Scott turned me on to all kinds of good stuff (including this EP) back when finding out about music you did not hear on the radio required you to have knowledgeable friends.  In the days before the Internet, MySpace, etc. it was all about word-of-mouth, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzine"&gt;fanzines&lt;/a&gt; and tape trading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I listened to a lot of metal back then.  Today some of it I enjoy for just the nostalgia, and most of it seems like just a quaint and unintentionally humorous soundtrack for 1980s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angst#In_popular_music"&gt;white-suburban-teen-angst&lt;/a&gt;.  However, a small percentage of it remains quite good, often for reasons that are hard to express.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blacktask.net/"&gt;Blacktask&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal"&gt;thrash metal&lt;/a&gt; band from Philadelphia.  They released a 3 song demo tape in 1984 ("&lt;a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=109858"&gt;Spikes to the Wall&lt;/a&gt;") that was pretty good, but their &lt;a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=14552"&gt;self-titled 1984 EP&lt;/a&gt; (released on the tiny label &lt;a href="http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/label-label-Damnation_Records-l-en.html"&gt;Damnation Records&lt;/a&gt;) was the high water mark for this band.  The four songs on the EP were titled "Sex and Destruction", "Kill Your Enemies", "Firestorm" and "Smash Your Face".  That should pretty much tell you all you need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this EP they managed to combine the best elements of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer#Show_No_Mercy_.281983.E2.80.931984.29"&gt;early Slayer&lt;/a&gt; (esp. the opening riff on "Sex and Destruction"), &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_%28band%29"&gt;Venom&lt;/a&gt; (the opening of "Kill Your Enemies" sounds like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Lant"&gt;Cronos&lt;/a&gt; to me), &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot%C3%B6rhead"&gt;Motorhead&lt;/a&gt; (check out the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy"&gt;Lemmy&lt;/a&gt;-esque bass on the "Smash Your Face") and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk"&gt;hardcore punk&lt;/a&gt;.  The punk influence is especially notable -- the entire EP is 10 minutes long with the  songs clocking in at 1:28, 2:40, 2:08 and 3:47.  This is in sharp contrast with most metal bands that were doing longer, more heavily-structured songs that were due to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_of_British_Heavy_Metal"&gt;NWOBHM&lt;/a&gt; influence.  For most metal bands a 1:28 track is a "spooky intro", not a full song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The production quality is typical for the era -- which is to say almost non-existent.  But that's part of the appeal, of course.  Sure, it sounds a lot like AM radio static, but how else would you capture the fury of these songs?  Polish that out and they're just not as good.  This is the same reason that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues#Early_post-war_era"&gt;1950s era blues&lt;/a&gt; sounds the best -- some things are not meant to be cleaned up.  Sadly, the band did not realize this and their 1986 LP "&lt;a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=14148"&gt;Long After Midnight&lt;/a&gt;" was polished and it s-u-c-k-e-d.  Don't waste your $ on that LP (I have a vinyl version somewhere, played just once or twice).  It's best to just pretend that Blacktask only released the demo + the EP.  Add these songs to your "exercise" playlist on your iPod and if they don't help you get that last mile, set, or whatever then nothing will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: all -- "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1JpSlmJNTI"&gt;Sex and Destruction&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl_jtfSWqqA"&gt;Kill Your Enemies&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBi_zCZoMFc"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbw7kThxOsk"&gt;Smash Your Face&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Why just a 9?  Two reasons: 1) I've been reserving 10/10 for genre-defining releases and while this is a nearly perfect 4 song EP it synthesizes the influences listed above; and 2) its "just" an EP; a 10 song LP in this vein would have earned a 10/10.  In contrast, Slayer's "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/05/slayer-haunting-chapel-lp-review.html"&gt;Haunting the Chapel&lt;/a&gt;" EP would earn a 10/10 because of its genre-defining influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S.  The above links are to YouTube versions of the song, but an entry on "&lt;a href="http://bounded-by-metal.blogspot.com/2009/01/black-task-black-task-ep.html"&gt;bounded by metal&lt;/a&gt;" has a link that ultimately leads you to MP3 versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.P.S.  Yes, I know this is an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt; and I've labeled it an &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/LP%20review"&gt;LP review&lt;/a&gt;.  I've decided against separate labels for reviews of singles and EPs.</content>

    <title>Slapp Happy - "Blue Flower"  (the song remains the same)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346437+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SXkC794RGxI/AAAAAAAAAEU/4gKkWWWddOg/s1600-h/SlappHappy_AlbumCover_SortOf.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SXkC794RGxI/AAAAAAAAAEU/4gKkWWWddOg/s320/SlappHappy_AlbumCover_SortOf.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5294266066196830994" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 244px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 240px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This installment of "the song remains the same" is based on a suggestion from Danette.  The focus is on the song "Blue Flower" which first appeared on the 1972 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_Of"&gt;Sort Of&lt;/a&gt;" from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapp_Happy"&gt;Slapp Happy&lt;/a&gt;.   Haven't heard of them?  Well, don't feel bad because nobody else has heard of them either.  In fact, although this entry is about Slapp Happy's song, I've never actually heard the original.  I can't find any trace of the song online and I'm unwilling to spend the money to purchase the LP. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Slapp+Happy"&gt; last.fm&lt;/a&gt; has some of their material online and you can get an idea of what it &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;might&lt;/span&gt; sound like, but they don't have "Blue Flower".  (edit: via &lt;a href="http://blip.fm/crescentius"&gt;crescentius&lt;/a&gt;, there is &lt;a href="http://blip.fm/profile/crescentius/blip/46451003/Slapp+Happy%E2%80%93Blue+Flower"&gt;a version on blip.fm&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, most people probably have heard the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazzy_Star"&gt;Mazzy Star&lt;/a&gt; version from their 1990 debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Hangs_Brightly"&gt;She Hangs Brightly&lt;/a&gt;".  Despite being best well-known for their lazy "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_pop"&gt;dream pop&lt;/a&gt;", Mazzy Star gives a jangly, straight ahead version that is probably close to the original.  There is a good live version on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Swb95tYHTQ"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhIq5uk2hW8"&gt;studio version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1992, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Saints"&gt;Pale Saints&lt;/a&gt; also covered the song on their "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Pale-Saints-Throwing-Back-The-Apple/release/393899"&gt;Throwing Back the Apple&lt;/a&gt;" EP (and at least one version of the "&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Pale-Saints-In-Ribbons/release/420903"&gt;In Ribbons&lt;/a&gt;" LP released on Warner Brothers).  The Pale Saints cover the song in the typical early 90s style of fellow &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4AD"&gt;4AD&lt;/a&gt; artists: lush and epic -- very much in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegazing"&gt;shoegazing&lt;/a&gt; style.  The studio version can be found on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hazYYBSdTeI"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (a 1991 &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPkXQP20pDk"&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt; is also available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great song regardless of arrangement.</content>

    <title>Toots &amp; the Maytals - "Pressure Drop"  (the song remains the same) (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346451+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SXIOBTEHdGI/AAAAAAAAAEM/bSevj5BBrRc/s1600-h/toots-and-the-maytals.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 187px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SXIOBTEHdGI/AAAAAAAAAEM/bSevj5BBrRc/s320/toots-and-the-maytals.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5292307927573951586" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the first in a new series I'm calling "the song remains the same" in which I look at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"&gt;cover versions&lt;/a&gt; of songs.  Why?  Because I love covers.  One of the unfortunate side effects introduced by the popularity of The Beatles, The Kinks, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and other contemporary artists is the mythologizing of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singer-songwriter#North_America_and_United_Kingdom"&gt;singer-songwriter&lt;/a&gt;.  Individuals and groups were held in higher esteem if they played original music as opposed to the music of others.  In contemporary use, to be called a "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_band"&gt;cover-band&lt;/a&gt;" is considered a great slur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's unfortunate, because there are far more talented musicians than there are talented songwriters -- by at least one, maybe two, orders of magnitude.  The truth is there are a lot of great singers, guitarists, etc. that have nothing to say.  To hear their craft, we have to endure aimless songs with dreadful lyrics.  If your group has a budding &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Davies"&gt;Ray Davies&lt;/a&gt;, by all means, write a lot of original material.  If you don't (be honest), please consult the catalog of, say, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits"&gt;Tom Waits&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC"&gt;Husker Du&lt;/a&gt; for an appropriate vehicle to showcase your skills.  Their songs are 100X better than yours and most people still won't recognize them so we all win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the mid-60s, "cover" songs were the norm in blues, jazz, country and even rock.  Sure, there would be a handful of originals, but reworking standards and traditional songs was expected.  You proved your mettle by your arrangement of proven material.  Enough history; I recommend "&lt;a href="http://www.freedomofexpression.us/book.html"&gt;Freedom of Expression&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://www.freedomofexpression.us/bio.html"&gt;Kembrew McLeod&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in this and related topics.  On to the music...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_Drop_%28song%29"&gt;Pressure Drop&lt;/a&gt;" is a 1969 song from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toots_and_the_Maytals"&gt;Toots &amp;amp; The Maytals&lt;/a&gt;.  TATM are one of the progenitors of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae"&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt;, even going so far as to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_the_Reggay"&gt;invent the term "reggae"&lt;/a&gt; itself.  Despite their longevity and centrality, they don't enjoy the mainstream recognition of artists such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley"&gt;Bob Marley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tosh"&gt;Peter Tosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_%22Scratch%22_Perry"&gt;Lee "Scratch" Perry&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  Fortunately, other musicians know about TATM and have covered many of their songs, the most popular of which is "Pressure Drop".  While the various artists listed below have more or less kept it within the original vein, they each find a different aspect of the song to make it their own.  The song is fun to sing along with regardless of the version.  Given the relative obscurity of the original TATM version (earning it a "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/search/label/forgotten%20song"&gt;forgotten song&lt;/a&gt;" label as well), we can be thankful that so many artists have also enjoyed this song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tootsandthemaytals.com/"&gt;Toots &amp;amp; The Maytals&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ao3Z5I6FI8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Toots+and+The+Maytals/_/Pressure+Drop"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm not sure on which LP this originally appeared.  They have a 1969 release entitled "Sweet and Dandy", but that is also the name of one of their greatest hits compilations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Palmer_%28singer%29"&gt;Robert Palmer&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjArEnHPyFU"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Robert+Palmer/_/Pressure+Drop"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.  Palmer even titled his 1975 second solo LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_Drop_%28album%29"&gt;Pressure Drop&lt;/a&gt;".  He plays this one close to the original, but with the tempo nicely slowed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Specials"&gt;The Specials&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUxWmDgSXP4"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  An obvious choice for one the 1996 revival LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today%27s_Specials"&gt;Today's Specials&lt;/a&gt;" from the one of the original &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt; bands.  This version extends the original with additional lyrics and a ska arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyv16mZakVE"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Clash/_/Pressure+Drop"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.  First released as the B-side for the 1979 single "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War_%28song%29"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt;" and then again on their 1980 compilation "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Black_Market_Clash#Black_Market_Clash"&gt;Black Market Clash&lt;/a&gt;", this continues The Clash's (and in general, punk's) &lt;a href="http://www.punk77.co.uk/punkhistory/reggae.htm"&gt;interest in reggae music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer_and_the_Mescaleros"&gt;Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqKP8ieRSFI"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  Strummer's interest in this song did not end when he left The Clash.  I think they only performed this song live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izzy_Stradlin"&gt;Izzy Stradlin &amp;amp; The Ju Ju Hounds&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVT0OgiE3yk"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.  From their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izzy_Stradlin_%26_the_Ju_Ju_Hounds"&gt;eponymous 1992 LP&lt;/a&gt;.  Not my favorite version, but they get points for doing something outside their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_N%27_Roses"&gt;GnR&lt;/a&gt; repertoire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're asking where you've heard this song before, you probably remember The Clash version from the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5PgHAHAoRw"&gt;Nissan Rogue commercial&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago.</content>

    <title>DJ Shadow - "The Outsider"  (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346464+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Theoutsider_djshadow.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 280px; height: 251px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f7/Theoutsider_djshadow.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where to begin?  First, I have to say &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow"&gt;DJ Shadow&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite artists.  I have worked hard to collect a good portion of his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow#Discography"&gt;varied discography&lt;/a&gt; (the few studio LPs he's released represent only a small bit).  Second, I don't want to sound like I'm down on this release because it's not just a rehash of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endtroducing....."&gt;Endtroducing....&lt;/a&gt;" (or even "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psyence_Fiction"&gt;Psyence  Fiction&lt;/a&gt;").  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Press"&gt;The Private Press&lt;/a&gt;" has already established that he can continue to innovate and not just mine the same ground over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therein lies the problem...  While  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsider_%28album%29"&gt;The Outsider&lt;/a&gt;" is a grab-bag of different styles, there is almost no new ground and no central theme or vision that unites them.  I won't mention most of the 13+ guest artists on this LP because, frankly, most of them aren't good enough to carry Shadow's crates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The train wreck begins with a spoken word intro that's too long ("Outsider Intro") and a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lounge_music"&gt;lounge&lt;/a&gt;-inspired track ("This Time (I'm Gonna Try It My Way)") that proves &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thievery_Corporation"&gt;Thievery Corporation&lt;/a&gt; has nothing to worry about.  Then there are two &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphy"&gt;hyphy&lt;/a&gt; tracks ("3 Freaks", "Turf Dancing") that have big beats and silly lyrics.  Ok, so it's DJ Shadow doing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphy"&gt;hyphy&lt;/a&gt;, but is he adding anything new?  I don't know the genre all that well, but it sounds indistinguishable from the other examples I've heard.  I liked it better when Shadow &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;invented&lt;/span&gt; genres instead of just participating in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three dreadful rap songs: "Keep 'em Close", "Backstage Girls" and "Dat's My Part".  The rappers are awful and the lyrics puerile (in the "bitches and hoes" style).  Those songs actually make me cringe.  There are two &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina"&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt;-inspired songs: "Seein' Thangs" and "Broken Levee Blues".  The former is not bad, and the latter is a simple but effective instrumental.  "Artifact" is an instrumental that sounds like a hip-hop interpretation of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt; song.  There's a novelty appeal I guess, but no staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Triplicate / Something Happened That Day" is interesting, mostly because it sounds like it could have been included on "The Private Press" (and the fact that it is based on John Cage's "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2TNDevy1yY"&gt;In a Landscape&lt;/a&gt;").  Similarly, "The Tiger" and "Erase You" sound like outtakes from "Psyence Fiction" -- not bad, but not new either.  "What Have I Done" is a spoken word, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age"&gt;new age&lt;/a&gt; song that is inadvertently funny (ex. "I am your healing spirit" -- really?!  this is the kind of thing that you sample to be ironic (cf. "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5OGk9N8Y5s"&gt;Blood on the Motorway&lt;/a&gt;"), not the kind of thing you actually create).  "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3o1T6JALbY"&gt;You Made It&lt;/a&gt;" sounds like the theme song for a yet-to-be-created sitcom.  Listen to it, listen to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCL3B5LgUCo"&gt;Sonny Curtis,&lt;/a&gt; and then tell me I'm wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuff"&gt;Enuff&lt;/a&gt;" is a good, commercial song and features &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Tip_%28rapper%29"&gt;Q-Tip&lt;/a&gt; and former  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solesides"&gt;Solesides&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quannum_Projects"&gt;Quannum&lt;/a&gt; colleague &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateef"&gt;Lateef the Truth Speaker&lt;/a&gt;.  I can understand Shadow's desire for commercial success.  If he really wants to be commercial (and I don't hold that against him, he's earned it), I'd like to see him work more with the Quannum crew: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackalicious"&gt;Blackalicious&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latyrx"&gt;Latyrx&lt;/a&gt;, et al.  They deserve to be on the same stage with him.  His new guests are beneath him and are holding him back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8qK1xrFN0w"&gt;Enuff&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVgPeoUGNbQ"&gt;Triplicate / Something Happened That Day&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy-z8E2ldH8"&gt;Broken Levee Blues&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks:  All except the 3 mentioned above.  Don't believe me?  Listen to them at &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Shadow/The+Outsider"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.  You were warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 2/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2010-11-21 Edit: This post has been identified as &lt;a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512c/notice.cgi?NoticeID=50528"&gt;violating DMCA&lt;/a&gt;, which of course is completely false.

    <title>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark - "So In Love"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346476+00:00</updated>

Although I did not realize it at the time, OMD had 5 critically acclaimed LPs prior to the more commercially oriented "Crush".  I recall this song receiving minor airplay on MTV, but then all trace of it was removed when the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_%28soundtrack%29"&gt;Pretty in Pink soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; juggernaut rolled through.  It has a nice hook and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_McCluskey"&gt;Andy McCluskey&lt;/a&gt; certainly has a distinctive voice, but what does it for me is the mid-80s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthpop"&gt;synth pop&lt;/a&gt; meets &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Sound"&gt;Wall of Sound&lt;/a&gt; production quality.

    <title>The Highwaymen - "Highwayman"  (forgotten song)</title>

How about them singing "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highwayman_%28song%29"&gt;Highwayman&lt;/a&gt;", a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Webb"&gt;Jimmy Webb&lt;/a&gt; song that is: 1) a literal account of reincarnation, 2) an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29"&gt;objectivist&lt;/a&gt; paean to heroic individualism, or 3) an example of  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return#Friedrich_Nietzsche"&gt;Nietzschean eternal recurrence&lt;/a&gt;.  Take your pick, but it's a cool song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a single of the 1985 debut LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highwayman_%28album%29"&gt;Highwayman&lt;/a&gt;".  Cash, Jennings, Nelson &amp;amp; Kristofferson are four of the main figures in "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw_country"&gt;Outlaw Country&lt;/a&gt;", which is a lot more fun than the lifeless, corporate- &amp;amp; RNC-approved pablum that currently passes for country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIB0lG0ZTAU"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (live 1993)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Links #1, studio version: &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Cash/_/Highwayman"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFkcAH-m9W0"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (cheesy video alert!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Links #2, Jimmy Webb version: &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jimmy+Webb/_/The+Highwayman"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LmD0TE41Xk"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Link #3, Glen Campell: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeWh8eza288"&gt;live 1992&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Thanks to Joy for the updated links: 2015-03-07)</content>

    <title>Lukid - "Onandon"  (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346503+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3WT4t32-I/AAAAAAAAAKw/j2jR246jdMU/s1600-h/WERKCD003_Cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3WT4t32-I/AAAAAAAAAKw/j2jR246jdMU/s200/WERKCD003_Cover.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5363178368398777314" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Lukid-Onandon/release/913437"&gt;Onandon&lt;/a&gt;" is the 2007 debut LP by Luke Blair, aka &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/lukid"&gt;Lukid&lt;/a&gt;.  Herbert first turned me on to Lukid, but it took quite some time for me to find a copy.  It is released on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werk_Discs"&gt;Werk Discs&lt;/a&gt;, a small indie label based in London.  It now seems to be more available in places like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=lukid+onandon&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; so you should not have any problem finding a copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing instrumental electronica LP.  The songs are dense and lush.  They find the right balance between being rich enough to allow for active listening, but not so busy that you can't focus on other tasks while listening.  This balance is hard to achieve.  For example, I like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Spooky"&gt;DJ Spooky&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems he tries to prove how smart he is on every track and overworks them to the point where 1 song contains 3 songs worth of ideas.  In contrast, Lukid seems to have hit the sweet spot between "too busy" and "too bland".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of good electronica LPs out there, but few that I would describe as "fresh" or "innovative".  "Onandon" is both.  I could try to further describe the music, but since song samples are well represented on &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/LUKID/Onandon"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/lukid"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; you should just go there and listen for yourself.  I eagerly look forward to Lukid's next release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZsAzxMKA8w"&gt;Smart Girl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/LUKID/Onandon/Onandon"&gt;Onandon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/LUKID/Onandon/Wonder+Years"&gt;Wonder Years&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/LUKID/Onandon/Fela"&gt;Fela&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: "Isis" is interesting, but has a shrill sound that often causes me to skip to the next track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10.</content>

    <title>Misfits - "Where Eagles Dare"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346516+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWUC3HAXzLI/AAAAAAAAAC8/xE4ymTWL6N4/s1600-h/Nightofthelivindead_cover.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288636483213184178" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWUC3HAXzLI/AAAAAAAAAC8/xE4ymTWL6N4/s400/Nightofthelivindead_cover.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 225px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4394"&gt;Where Eagles Dare&lt;/a&gt;" is the B-side of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misfits_%28band%29"&gt;Misfits&lt;/a&gt;'s 1979 "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead_%28song%29"&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/a&gt;" single (although the links below are of the overdubbed version on the 1985 compilation "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Brutality"&gt;Legacy of Brutality&lt;/a&gt;").  The Misfits were the progenitors of the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_punk"&gt;horror punk&lt;/a&gt;" sub-genre -- think sci-fi and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombies_in_popular_culture"&gt;zombie movies&lt;/a&gt; set to music (the single title is a reference to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead"&gt;canonical zombie film&lt;/a&gt; and it was released on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_Records"&gt;Plan 9 Records&lt;/a&gt; which is a reference to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space"&gt;Plan 9 From Outer Space&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't believe the Misfits ever received much in the way of radio or MTV airplay.  I'm not sure they ever had a "hit", although candidates might include "She", "Die, Die My Darling", and "Last Caress".  In fact, most people probably learned of the Misfits posthumously from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt; covers of the latter two songs on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_Inc."&gt;Garage, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_$5.98_E.P.:_Garage_Days_Re-Revisited"&gt;Garage Days Re-revisited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Danzig"&gt;Glenn Danzig&lt;/a&gt;'s first band, and his subsequent bands (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain_%28band%29"&gt;Samhain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danzig_%28band%29"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt;) would become more metal and less campy (or less "intentionally campy" anyway).  I was never a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;huge&lt;/span&gt; Misfits fan during my metal &amp;amp; punk years and I didn't hear this song until several years later.  Despite all this, I think "Where Eagles Dare" has the strongest hook of all their songs that I've heard, but without sacrificing their trademark ferocity.  The profanity in the chorus pretty much assures that you won't hear this elsewhere, so give it a listen with links below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Links: &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LOaEzmaPfU"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Misfits/_/Where+Eagles+Dare"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2012-07-21 Edit: Clearly this song needs a slow, acoustic cover version...&amp;nbsp; Check out &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pajo"&gt;David Pajo&lt;/a&gt;'s version of "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSiyh6MS0tg"&gt;Where Eagles Dare&lt;/a&gt;" -- surprisingly good!</content>

    <title>Barnes and Barnes - "Fish Heads"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346529+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWPHvJbXiCI/AAAAAAAAAC0/Gob1JLVIR4o/s1600-h/fish-heads.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 245px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWPHvJbXiCI/AAAAAAAAAC0/Gob1JLVIR4o/s320/fish-heads.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288290000261580834" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_Heads_%28song%29"&gt;Fish Heads&lt;/a&gt;" is a 1978 single from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_and_Barnes"&gt;Barnes and Barnes&lt;/a&gt; (it can also be found on their 1980 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voobaha"&gt;Voobaha&lt;/a&gt;").  The only way you'd hear this on the radio is if you were listening to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Demento"&gt;Dr. Demento&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a silly (but fun) novelty song, but I'm presenting it here only because I realized that in many of the "forgotten song" entries, I've waxed nostalgic about the early days of MTV and the fact that they would play just about anything that had a video, including some alternative material that otherwise would not be played on the radio (at least in the Hampton Roads region).  At that time, MTV had so few videos (and no other programming) that they would have to play "intermissions" (as far as I recall, just image montage videos set to instrumental music) &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;because they had nothing else to show&lt;/span&gt;!  I must be one of the few that actually remembers this, because I can't even find a clever page to link to describe it (the best I can do is this list of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_music_videos_aired_on_MTV"&gt;Day 1 Programming for MTV&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead of the regularly scheduled modestly successful pop songs, this MTV nostalgia moment features "Fish Heads", with lyrics like "ask a fish head anything you want to / they won't answer, they can't talk".  But hey, it had a video so it was put in rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx9KjdUjKzc"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>My Bloody Valentine - "You Made Me Realise"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346542+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWO3s2nmYcI/AAAAAAAAACc/C5OgL9QrdVk/s1600-h/Youmademerealise.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288272368666829250" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWO3s2nmYcI/AAAAAAAAACc/C5OgL9QrdVk/s400/Youmademerealise.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 205px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Made_Me_Realise"&gt;You Made Me Realise&lt;/a&gt;" is a 1988 release by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_%28band%29"&gt;My Bloody Valentine&lt;/a&gt;.  It was first released as a 7" single and then a 12" EP, then a CD.  But the CD is out of print and you'll pay &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00004SF22/ref=sr_1_olp_6?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1231271570&amp;amp;sr=8-6"&gt;stupid $$$&lt;/a&gt; to get a copy.  I don't have a copy, so I'm just focusing on the song and not the entire EP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MBV is one of my favorite bands and their impact reaches beyond their relatively &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_discography"&gt;limited output&lt;/a&gt;.   Discussion of MBV is inevitably dominated by their landmark 1991 "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegazing"&gt;shoegazing&lt;/a&gt;" LP "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2013/05/my-bloody-valentine-loveless-lp-review.html"&gt;Loveless&lt;/a&gt;", one of my favorite LPs of all time.  I'll review that LP later, but suffice to say that it was so good it effectively ended the genre because there was nothing left to accomplish after it was released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite easy to overlook this song, considering:  1) the gravitational pull of "Loveless", 2) this song was never released on an LP,  and 3) the EP is out of print.  The celebrated MBV sound is still forming and there is more of a conventional song structure.  It is "fuzzy", but actually rocks a good bit harder than most of the material on the LP that immediately followed, 1988's "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isn%27t_Anything"&gt;Isn't Anything&lt;/a&gt;".  It sounds more like MBV covering a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain"&gt;Jesus and Mary Chain&lt;/a&gt; song, and that's pretty good in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9qLnmEN7S8"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/_/You+Made+Me+Realise"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: This EP and others are now available on the compilation: "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EP%27s_1988%E2%80%931991"&gt;EPs 1988-1991&lt;/a&gt;". &amp;nbsp; I'll review it later, but it is worth getting.</content>

    <title>New Order - "Movement"  (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346555+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3XeEgHMDI/AAAAAAAAALQ/8NjnKXqwpB8/s1600-h/New_Order_Movement_Cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3XeEgHMDI/AAAAAAAAALQ/8NjnKXqwpB8/s200/New_Order_Movement_Cover.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5363179642872606770" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In 1980, right as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division"&gt;Joy Division&lt;/a&gt; was poised for major commercial success, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Curtis"&gt;Ian Curtis&lt;/a&gt; (lead singer) committed suicide.  The three remaining members of Joy Division formed as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt;.  Very shortly  afterwards &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Gilbert"&gt;Gillian Gilbert&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Morris"&gt;Stephen Morris&lt;/a&gt;'s then girlfriend and now wife) was added to make New Order a 4 piece.  The subject of Curtis and Joy Division has been covered in various films  (e.g. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_%282007_film%29"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hour_Party_People"&gt;24 Hour Party People&lt;/a&gt;) and documentaries (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1097239/"&gt;Joy Division&lt;/a&gt;).  I have no new insights to offer there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, when most people think of New Order they think of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarre_Love_Triangle"&gt;Bizarre Love Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_%28New_Order_song%29"&gt;Blue Monday&lt;/a&gt; and the various other mid- and late-1980s dance synth-pop singles they released (and the dozens of associated remixes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Released in 1981, "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_%28New_Order_album%29"&gt;Movement&lt;/a&gt;" is the sound of a band in transition from the post-punk sound of Joy Division to the synth band New Order would become several years later.  Most people don't especially care of this LP for those reasons: it is neither Joy Division (b/c of Curtis's absence), nor New Order (in the conventional sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, however, really like this LP &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; of its transitional sound.  Many songs are arranged like their dance singles would be arranged, but the technology hasn't caught up (so the synthesizer parts are limited and conventional instruments often used in their place) and consequently the sound is not marred by the cheesy, mid-80's  "casio sound" that limits my enjoyment of New Order's later LPs.  JD/NO were/are first rate song writers, and this LP is solid from start to finish.  The shadow of Curtis looms over this LP -- neither &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Sumner"&gt;Bernard Sumner&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hook"&gt;Stephen Hook&lt;/a&gt; sing with his confidence (but who does?) and many of the songs sound like what the next Joy Division LP would have sounded like (indeed, some of the singles from this era were unrecorded Joy Division songs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing preventing this record from receiving a higher score is that it lacks strong, stand-out singles.  That is because their strongest singles of this era: &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-order-ceremony-song-remains-same.html"&gt;Ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procession_%28song%29"&gt;Procession&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything%27s_Gone_Green"&gt;Everything's Gone Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temptation_%28New_Order_song%29"&gt;Temptation&lt;/a&gt;, were all released only as singles and not included on a studio LP.  There is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_%28New_Order_album%29#Track_listing"&gt;2008 collector's edition&lt;/a&gt; that collects these singles, alternate versions and b-sides onto a bonus disc for "Movement" and that would look to be the version to get if you don't already have this LP (or "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_%28New_Order_album%29"&gt;Substance&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXuRe0GkXyA"&gt;Dreams Never End&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU3w0f9NPnk"&gt;The Him&lt;/a&gt; (live &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjpZwiMmwgA"&gt;Glastonbury 1981&lt;/a&gt;, live &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6_EYeHl8sM"&gt;Hamburg 1981&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn3GWiW-2eM"&gt;Denial&lt;/a&gt;.  (1981-1982 era singles not on LP: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NywWewLu1OA"&gt;Ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA4gL9lJkbk"&gt;Procession&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcZrTQr-F7U"&gt;Everything's Gone Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfRYGVWZilU"&gt;Temptation&lt;/a&gt; -- thanks to those who posted these amazing, rare clips on YouTube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 7/10 (original version as released in 1981).&lt;br /&gt;If the 4 singles had originally appeared on the LP, it would have rated a 9/10.</content>

    <title>Dr. Octagon / Handsome Boy Modeling School / Dan the Automator - "Bear Witness I, II, III"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346568+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3XuyZceOI/AAAAAAAAALY/-BrHOHfNA6Y/s1600-h/So_how%27s_your_girl.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3XuyZceOI/AAAAAAAAALY/-BrHOHfNA6Y/s200/So_how%27s_your_girl.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5363179930070579426" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Is it really a "forgotten song" if very few people heard it to begin with?  In this segment, I step away from obscure videos I recall from the early days of MTV to bring to your attention what is really three songs that are apparently by three different artists, span seven years yet share a single title: "Bear Witness", parts I, II and III.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Bear Witness" is on the 1996 release "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Octagonecologyst"&gt;Dr. Octagonecologyst&lt;/a&gt;" by Dr. Octagon (aka &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool_Keith"&gt;Kool Keith&lt;/a&gt;).  "Holy Calamity (Bear Witness II)" is from the 1999 release "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So..._How%27s_Your_Girl%3F"&gt;So... How's Your Girl?&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handsome_Boy_Modeling_School"&gt;Handsome Boy Modeling School&lt;/a&gt;.  "Bear Witness III" is (as far as I can determine) a 2002 &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/575793"&gt;12" only release&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_the_Automator"&gt;Dan the Automator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The common thread is Dan the Automator.  He's the producer on the Dr. Octagon LP and he's 1/2 of HBMS (on the left in the photo above; the other 1/2 is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_La_Soul"&gt;De La Soul&lt;/a&gt; affiliate &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Huston"&gt;Prince Paul&lt;/a&gt;).  The Dr. Octagon LP is critically acclaimed.  I don't have a copy, but in the few samples I've found online it appears to be an extended joke that I don't find very funny.  Perhaps if I listened to it start to finish, but I doubt it.  The HBMS LP is also critically acclaimed; it's on my list to get but I just haven't done it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have none of the associated LPs, I "discovered" this song because "Bear Witness II" is featured on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Shadow"&gt;DJ Shadow&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live%21_In_Tune_and_on_Time"&gt;Live! In Tune and On Time&lt;/a&gt;" LP.  Dan the Automator and DJ Shadow are frequent collaborators; in fact DJ Shadow guests on "Bear Witness II" (see also: "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_the_Hard_Way:_Guns,_Cars_and_Sitars"&gt;Bombay the Hard Way: Guns, Cars, and Sitars&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so that was a confusing and possibly unnecessary explanation of the pedigree of this song cycle.  They represent some of the best in largely instrumental hip hop: big beats, hooks, great samples, fun vocal fills ("create rap music cuz I never dug disco"), etc.  I guess they're old enough to qualify as "forgotten", so give them a listen whether it is for the 1st time or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Links: All three songs nicely edited into a single track: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srg9Z969Kw"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Bear Witness I: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH2flVJ7OP4"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Bear Witness II: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrkAy_QvsAU"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Bear Wtiness III: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26E6QYEd-8Y"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>Ric Ocasek - "Something To Grab For"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346582+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWEulNbifmI/AAAAAAAAACE/9xDFnSoHDgQ/s1600-h/ric-ocasek.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 249px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWEulNbifmI/AAAAAAAAACE/9xDFnSoHDgQ/s320/ric-ocasek.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287558654304878178" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This 1982 single from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Ocasek"&gt;Ric Ocasek&lt;/a&gt;'s first solo LP, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatitude_%28Ric_Ocasek_album%29"&gt;Beatitude&lt;/a&gt;, received a bit of radio and MTV airplay.  But ultimately it was overshadowed by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cars"&gt;The Cars&lt;/a&gt; oeuvre.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm a big fan of The Cars, and their influence on modern pop music is hard to overstate.  But...  this is a good example of "did he really need to release this solo?"  This song is indistinguishable from other songs by The Cars.  Was Ocasek holding out some of his better material in anticipation of leaving the band?  Was it presented to The Cars and turned down?  That seems unlikely (interesting side note: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hawkes"&gt;Greg Hawkes&lt;/a&gt;, keyboard player for The Cars, played on Beatitude).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So maybe you remember this song.  Maybe you remember &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Gravatte"&gt;Marianne Gravatte&lt;/a&gt; from the video. But you probably haven't heard it in a while.  Rewind to 1982 and give it another listen.

    <title>The Members - "Working Girl"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346594+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWD87HWbFGI/AAAAAAAAAB8/CWqmrzmkjX0/s1600-h/members-working-girl.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 221px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWD87HWbFGI/AAAAAAAAAB8/CWqmrzmkjX0/s320/members-working-girl.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287504055048541282" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"Working Girl" is a 1981 single from the UK group &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Members"&gt;The Members&lt;/a&gt;.  It later appeared on the 1982 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uprhythm,_Downbeat"&gt;Uprhythm, Downbeat&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't recall this receiving radio airplay in the US, but it was a staple from the early days of MTV.  If you had MTV in the early 80s, you've heard this song.  If you didn't, you haven't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won't change your musical orientation, but it is a fun song and a pretty good video (by 1981 standards anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Links: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MuuTjT8AXs"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.vbox7.com/play:1258fe95"&gt;vbox7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/song/Working+Girl/2420964"&gt;grooveshark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Members/_/Working+Girl"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>The Cribs - "Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever"  (LP Review)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346607+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWD53XPKJ4I/AAAAAAAAABs/BJJjLMMR6QM/s1600-h/Mensneedswomensneedswhatever.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWD53XPKJ4I/AAAAAAAAABs/BJJjLMMR6QM/s200/Mensneedswomensneedswhatever.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287500692058679170" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_Needs,_Women%27s_Needs,_Whatever"&gt;Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever&lt;/a&gt;" is the third LP from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs"&gt;The Cribs&lt;/a&gt;.  This LP came out after I had fallen in love with their first two LPs.  I have to confess I was initially very disappointed with this LP.  The song writing is largely just as good as the first two (although not as uniformly good -- the best songs are as good as the best songs on the other LPs, but I find myself skipping more songs on this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a villain in this story, I'll go with the producer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kapranos"&gt;Alex Kapranos&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Ferdinand_%28band%29"&gt;Franz Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt;).  The sound on this LP is another entry in the  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"&gt;loudness war&lt;/a&gt;" (thanks to Johan for pointing this out).  The fuzzy, garage sound is gone and in its place is a sound that is just a bit &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;too&lt;/span&gt; polished and bright.  If I had heard this LP first, I probably would have no complaints.  But as it stands, it is simply not as good as the others.  But in fairness, the first two established a nearly impossibly high standard to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyrically, the targets have not changed (e.g., "You'd never exist if you wasn't generic", "fakes, liars, and stars of moving pictures / What's the difference? / Like all the parts that I'm not into / But I see in you").  The song "Be Safe" features a spoken word part by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ranaldo"&gt;Lee Ranaldo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth"&gt;Sonic Youth&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a very good song, but it sounds just a bit too similar to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nada_Surf"&gt;Nada Surf's&lt;/a&gt; "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNc45FTenhg"&gt;Popular&lt;/a&gt;".   My initial disappointment with it was that when you combine Lee Ranaldo with The Cribs, you shouldn't get a song that sounds similar to a novelty song that came out 11 years prior (just for the record, I do like the song).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really strong LP, but I can't help but wonder what it would have sounded like if Edwyn Collins (producer of the "&lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-new-fellas-lp-review.html"&gt;The New Fellas&lt;/a&gt;") had produced it instead of Kapranos.  I eagerly await their fourth release (sometime in 2009?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCNTYi9fHuo"&gt;Men's Needs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLKL6iUFSQQ"&gt;Our Bovine Public&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1l5PTZ8JRM"&gt;Moving Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cribs/_/Major%27s+Titling+Victory"&gt;Major's Titling Victory&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHh6rroM0O4"&gt;Be Safe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: "Shoot the Poets" -- another LP-closing acoustic piece that doesn't really work for me.  Although not really bad, I will sometimes find myself skipping "I'm a realist" and "Girls like mystery".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2014-04-23: Bonus links: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIuSZ2riAUU"&gt;entire LP&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvSulnJNx3g"&gt;demo version of "Our Bovine Public"&lt;/a&gt; (which answers the "what would this sound like without Alex Kapranos?" question). &amp;nbsp;</content>

    <title>The Clash - "This is Radio Clash"  (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346620+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SgkBzTZbvrI/AAAAAAAAAIc/1PRxN7BmyHs/s1600-h/Radio_Clash.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 197px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SgkBzTZbvrI/AAAAAAAAAIc/1PRxN7BmyHs/s200/Radio_Clash.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334797214488968882" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lodged somewhere between the critically acclaimed "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Calling"&gt;London Calling&lt;/a&gt;" and the commerically accessible "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_Rock"&gt;Combat Rock&lt;/a&gt;" LPs, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash"&gt;the only band that matters&lt;/a&gt; released a lot of experimental and genre-defying material, including the 3LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista%21"&gt;Sandinista!&lt;/a&gt;" and the 1981 single "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Radio_Clash"&gt;This is Radio Clash&lt;/a&gt;" that does not appear on any studio LPs (though it appears on several compilations -- which would be one of the few reasons a true fan would &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ever&lt;/span&gt; buy a compilation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, this song received some radio airplay and even a bit of MTV coverage.  You might even remember it.  But The Clash canon has been sadly reduced to "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIx7k2gYT1I"&gt;Train In Vain&lt;/a&gt;", "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ9r8LMU9bQ"&gt;Rock the Casbah&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trolcS3V7dY"&gt;Should I Stay or Should I Go&lt;/a&gt;" (and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjQobv6ztF4"&gt;I Fought the Law&lt;/a&gt;" if they're really digging).  Those are all fine songs, to be sure, but "This is Radio Clash" deserves to be heard.  It visually and lyrically presages the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_TV_Tour"&gt;U2 Zoo TV &lt;/a&gt;concept by, oh, 12 years.  It arguably shares a common thread with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk"&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/a&gt; novels such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling"&gt;Bruce Sterling's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islands_in_the_Net"&gt;Islands in the Net&lt;/a&gt;.  This is one of their most successful punk/dub/rap mashups.  Again, not to besmirch "Combat Rock", but you cannot listen to this and wistfully wonder what would have been if Mick Jones and Joe Strummer had patched their differences and given us a few more LPs in this vein (or at least "&lt;a href="http://captainsdead.com/sometimes-i-doubt-your-commitment-to-sparkle-motion.html"&gt;Rat Patrol from Fort Bragg&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YouTube links: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-t52zc8Ex4"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk0MnQft85M"&gt;Tom Snyder Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grooveshark links: &lt;a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/s/This+Is+Radio+Clash/2ti6nm?src=5"&gt;This is Radio Clash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/s/Radio+Clash/c0GBz?src=5"&gt;Radio Clash&lt;/a&gt;.  On the original single, I believe these two songs were run together as a single 8 minute song.  The above YouTube links, as well as most other versions you hear, are actually "This is Radio Clash" and not "Radio Clash".  The music is the same but the lyrics are different.  I've yet to find a copy of the 8 minute original.</content>

With this LP they have accomplished what few bands have done before: produce a sophomore effort that surpasses &lt;a href="http://f-measure.blogspot.com/2009/01/cribs-cribs.html"&gt;their first LP&lt;/a&gt;.  In many ways it follows the blue print from their previous release, but the song writing is even better (as if that were possible) and the LP really benefits from the production of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwyn_Collins"&gt;Edwyn Collins&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Juice"&gt;Orange Juice&lt;/a&gt; and later, "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkKxGzm98AU"&gt;Girl like you before&lt;/a&gt;" fame).  Collins brings out the best in the band: they're still garage, but the sound is tighter.  In a perfect world, everyone would know who The Cribs are,  this LP would be considered one of the classic LPs of all time, and the collaboration between Collins and The Cribs would go on forever (foreshadowing...). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyrically, the band continues to flay "the mirror kissing ways of the hipster type" and those who "take drugs, don't eat, have contempt for those you meet".  I could quote more witty lyrical nuggets, but you get the point.  Nearly every track is classic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QpkuxPJ-8A"&gt;Hey scenesters!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCHFaRULk9Y"&gt;Martell&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPuT1qeJIOA"&gt;acoustic version&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzqZborBWtA"&gt;Mirror kissers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOnn30jslWA"&gt;I'm alright me&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m5tvt-5r8I"&gt;We can no longer cheat you&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEfTdjFhr5A"&gt;Wrong way to be&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: "Haunted" is a short, acoustic, throw away track that while not bad, has to be considered the weakest on an otherwise perfect LP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013-04-07 Edit: It's been about four years since I wrote this review and if anything, my appreciation for this LP has only grown.&amp;nbsp; I had to laugh (in a sad way) when I read this &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1816-the-new-fellas/"&gt;2005 review on pitchfork&lt;/a&gt; -- some people just didn't "get it" until &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ranaldo"&gt;Lee Ranaldo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Marr"&gt;Johnny Marr&lt;/a&gt; told them The Cribs were cool.&amp;nbsp; "You were always late / But you always had a story..."</content>

    <title>Graham Parker - "Local Girls"   (forgotten song)</title>
    <updated>2016-04-19T19:50:09.346647+00:00</updated>
    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3X8Uo_iDI/AAAAAAAAALg/Skap97p3-kQ/s1600-h/graham-parker.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/Sm3X8Uo_iDI/AAAAAAAAALg/Skap97p3-kQ/s200/graham-parker.png" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5363180162600896562" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 148px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is my first installment in the "forgotten song" series where I highlight songs that may have been popular at one time, but for one reason or another have largely been forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rediscovered this gem on YouTube.  It is a single of Parker's 1979 LP "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezing_Out_Sparks"&gt;Squeezing Out Sparks&lt;/a&gt;".   I first heard this back in the first days of MTV, not only when MTV still played music, but also when they had so few videos that would play nearly anything (often including some truly alternative stuff).  I'm not sure this ever got radio airplay, but it was in heavy rotation on MTV.   This is an excellent song that deserves a second listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Links to the song at: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taXvBivGcMo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Graham+Parker/_/Local+Girls"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.</content>

    <title>The Cribs - "The Cribs"  (LP review)</title>

    <content type="text/html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWD6FgZ-cUI/AAAAAAAAAB0/jnJDY_bY01w/s1600-h/Cribs_debut.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xf_Yufxwils/SWD6FgZ-cUI/AAAAAAAAAB0/jnJDY_bY01w/s200/Cribs_debut.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287500935038136642" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 198px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"The Cribs" is the eponymous debut LP from the West Yorkshire-based band,&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cribs"&gt; The Cribs&lt;/a&gt;.  Although this LP was released in 2004, I did not discover them until 2007 on the YouTube Channel for their label "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/wichitarecordings"&gt;Wichita Recordings&lt;/a&gt;".  This will be the first of many Wichita Recordings LPs featured on "F-Measure".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite simply, The Cribs are currently my favorite band and all of my friends have had to suffer my extolment of the band.  They represent the pinnacle (?) of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music"&gt;lo-fi&lt;/a&gt; -- listening to their music puts you right there, in the garage with them -- complete with constant feedback squeals and other deliciously unpolished reminders.  They are not musical virtuosos, but they are songwriters almost without peer.  It almost seems like damning with faint praise to say so, but they write consummate power pop songs -- three minutes of perfection with strong hooks, snarky lyrics, and a liberal dose of "whoah!" and "oh yeah!" distributed through each song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply cannot understand why 1) more people don't know about this band and 2) they are not in heavy rotation on the radio.  Perhaps they have suffered from comparison to "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Libertines"&gt;The Libertines&lt;/a&gt;".  While I have nothing against The Libertines, such a comparison seems superficial and for my money the song writing of The Cribs is far better.  If I was forced to compare, I would actually say if &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer"&gt;Weezer&lt;/a&gt; is quintessentially American, then The Cribs are their UK counterpart.  I would go further and say The Cribs should be spoken of in the same breath as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ramones"&gt;The Ramones&lt;/a&gt;.  Yes, I think they're that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standout tracks: Nearly of them, but we'll settle on:  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PKDJrIMJFs"&gt;You were always the one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6J23i-NV5g"&gt;What about me&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvamQavzJpA"&gt;Baby don't sweat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve9InjyKXrE"&gt;Direction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_Ylt_A6kU0"&gt;Learning how to fight&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-Ewx__zs70"&gt;Full LP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip 'em tracks: The LP-closing track "Third Outing" doesn't really work for me, but not enough for me to complain.  The opening track "The Watch Trick" is not bad, but not really representative of the rest of the LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final score: 10/10</content>
