Rerun A9, Q2 but this time using LIBSVM.  If you have n categories,
you'll have to run it n times.  For example, if you're classifying music
and have the categories:\\
\\
metal, electronic, ambient, folk, hip-hop, pop\\
\\
you'll have to classify things as:\\
\\
metal / not-metal\\
electronic / not-electronic\\
ambient / not-ambient\\
\\
etc.\\
\\
Use the 500 term vectors describing each blog as the features, and
your mannally assigned classifications as the true values.  Use
10-fold cross-validation (as per slide 46, which shows 4-fold
cross-validation) and report the percentage correct for 
each of your categories.\\
