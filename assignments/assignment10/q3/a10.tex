Re-download the 1000 TimeMaps from A2, Q2.  Create a graph where
the x-axis represents the 1000 TimeMaps.  If a TimeMap has \enquote{shrunk},
it will have a negative value below the x-axis corresponding to the
size difference between the two TimeMaps.  If it has stayed the
same, it will have a \enquote{0} value.  If it has grown, the value will be 
positive and correspond to the increase in size between the two
TimeMaps.\\

As always, upload all the TimeMap data.  If the A2 github has the 
original TimeMaps, then you can just point to where they are in 
the report.
