Repeat A3, Q1.  Compare the resulting text from February to 
the text you have now.  Do all 1000 URIs still return a \enquote{200 OK}
as their final response (i.e., at the end of possible redirects)?\\
\\
Create two graphs similar to that described in Q3, except this 
time the y-axis corresponds to difference in bytes (and not difference
in TimeMap magnitudes).  For the first graph, use the difference
in the raw (unprocessed) results.  For the second graph, use the 
difference in the processed (as per A3, Q1) results.\\
\\
Of the URIs that still terminate in a \enquote{200 OK} response, pick the
top 3 most changed (processed) pairs of pages and use the Unix
\enquote{diff} command to explore the differences in the version pairs.
