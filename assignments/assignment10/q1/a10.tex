Using the data from A8:\\
\\
- Consider each row in the blog-term matrix as a 500 dimension vector, 
corresponding to a blog. \\
\\
- From chapter 8, replace numpredict.euclidean() with cosine as the 
distance metric.  In other words, you'll be computing the cosine between
vectors of 500 dimensions.\\
\\
- Use knnestimate() to compute the nearest neighbors for both:\\
