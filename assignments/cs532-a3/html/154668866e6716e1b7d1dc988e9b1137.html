It airs at 6:30pm ET on CBS</em>\r\n\r\nFrom babies in the womb trying to get to Doritos, to Wiener Dogs dressed as hot dogs racing to condiments to an elderly woman doing insane yoga, this year&rsquo;s Super Bowl ads will have something for everyone.\r\n\r\nLast year was, for lack of a better term, the &ldquo;Year of the Weepy.&rdquo; There were several that were designed to pluck at your heartstrings maybe none more so than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRVslkan08U\">Nationwide Insurance&rsquo;s ad</a> showing a young boy's life saying he couldn&rsquo;t do the&nbsp;things you see like getting married because he died in an accident. The ad&nbsp;was deemed not only one that went too far, but exploitive.\r\n\r\nAnd while there are ads packed with emotions this year, maybe the biggest thing is, no matter the product, advertisers are willing to spend the extra bucks on celebrities to make you, the consumer, stand up and take notice. After all, with ad costs reaching a record $5 million per 30 second spot, what&rsquo;s a bit more to make sure you remember it long after the Big Game is over?\r\n\r\nAccording to iSpot.tv, this year sees 40 ads that feature celebrities in one form or other (<strong><em>see the end of the article for the full list</em></strong>). They range from background soundtracks (Van Halen, to the late David Bowie) to musicians as actors (Steven Tyler to Drake) to athletes (Dan Marino to Randy Johnson and Tony Hawk) to the stately (Helen Mirren absolutely killing it in a Budweiser ad on driving drunk).\r\n\r\nNot all ads are released prior to the game, but many are to gain impressions online. Here&rsquo;s the best celebrity ads:\r\n\r\n<strong>KIA Optima&rsquo;s &ldquo;Walken Closet&rdquo;</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to cult of personality, Christopher Walken has to be one at the top. He&rsquo;s that fantastic blend of &ldquo;odd&rdquo; coupled with fierce hilarity (how many recall &ldquo;The Continental&rdquo; on Saturday Night Live?). So, when carmaker KIA hits a play on words where a husband asks his wife where his beige socks are, she of course tells him to look in the walk-in closet.\r\n\r\nWhen he walks in, he&rsquo;s shocked to find (you got it) Walken.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;There are two types of people in this world,&rdquo; Walken tells the man as he holds up the bland pair of socks. &ldquo;Those who are content to blend in; those who walk through life like beige socks, uninspired and bored. And there are those who expect more,&rdquo; as he raises his other hand cloaked in a flashy polka dot sock that Walken uses hilariously throughout the rest of the ad.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"9r0FrXXKeiA\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Amazon Echo &ndash; Alec Baldwin And Cheese Footballs</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, Baldwin has been a regular pitch man, so what makes his ad one of the tops? How about cheese footballs?\r\n\r\nBaldwin seems to be channeling a bit of his <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> character in this one as he dresses down the chefs for what can only be his big Super Bowl party. He never says anything about winners getting steak knives, but he could and it would seem to fit right in.\r\n\r\nBut what makes the ad so great is, A) Cheese footballs, and; B) His reference to Deflategate. No word if NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell gave it a thumbs down.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"EwVzgRfPoU8\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Audi R8 - &ldquo;Commander&rdquo; Commercial And David Bowie Soundtrack</strong>\r\n\r\nLike I said, not all ads are going for laughs this year. After all, whether it&rsquo;s laughs or heartstrings, the idea is an ad evokes emotion.\r\n\r\nAudi will assuredly be high on all the lists this year with its &ldquo;Commander&rdquo; ad. The ad hits home on a number of levels: its theme is around the great space programs of the 1960s when we seemed to be capable of anything, the sadness of the despondent elderly, and how a car as electric as the R8 is a combination of a rocket ship and a way to bring joy back into the old astronaut&rsquo;s life. Oh, and did we mention that it uses the late David Bowie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Starman&rdquo; as the soundtrack? It&rsquo;s an incredible blend that fans should make sure and see when it airs.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"diU_09jb4bI\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Budweiser &ndash; Helen Mirren&rsquo;s &ldquo;Give A Damn&rdquo;</strong>\r\n\r\nStately. Shakespearean. Helen Mirren is one of Britain&rsquo;s most accomplished actors. But much like Meryl Streep, Mirren has found some comedic stride later him her career, most notably with the <em>Red</em> series of films.\r\n\r\nFor the Budweiser ad, Mirren is simply set in a restaurant with the decidedly All-American, Super Bowl fan meal: cheeseburger, fries, and of course, a long-neck bottle of Bud.\r\n\r\nBut what sets this ad apart is how this coupling with Mirren allows her to get away with calling drunk drivers out and yet somehow making it all seem so incredibly proper.\r\n\r\nIt starts off by saying she&rsquo;s a &ldquo;notoriously frank and British lady.&rdquo; She then goes on with such properness to dress down those that get behind the wheel drunk.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I sum it up like this: If you drive drunk, you&mdash;simply put&mdash;are a short-sighted, oxygen-wasting, human form of pollution.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s more of this incredible goodness which ends with&nbsp;her tipping back and take a swig of the Bud at the end. How very proper.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"Rb2VXVmUga4\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Squarespace &ndash; The Key And Peele &ldquo;Real Talk&rdquo; series</strong>\r\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s always an advertiser that doubles down on Super Bowl advertisement, and this year, it&rsquo;s Squarespace with the outstanding comedic duo, Key and Peele. The ad series has three teasers, plus the true &ldquo;Real Talk&rdquo; ad. Maybe it&rsquo;s not ad libbed, but if it isn&rsquo;t, they had to write it. The key here is, you need to catch them all. Seriously funny.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"3VQkqkTEz4w\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>The 40 Super Bowl Ads Featuring Celebrities</strong>\r\n\r\nI didn&rsquo;t want to play spoiler on everything, so what you can do is take the iSpot.tv compiled list of all 40 ads that feature celebrities as part of the 2016 Super Bowl and reference it throughout the big game on Sunday.\r\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\"><table style=\"height: 3853px\" border=\"1\" width=\"640\" cellpadding=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Advertiser</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Spot</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Celebrity</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Type</strong></td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Acura</td>\r\n<td>What He Said</td>\r\n<td>Van Halen (song)</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Amazon Echo</td>\r\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Snack Stadium</td>\r\n<td>Alec Baldwin</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Dan Marino</td>\r\n<td>Athlete</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Amazon Echo</td>\r\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cheese Footballs</td>\r\n<td>Alec Baldwin</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Francis Dumaurier</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Apartments.com</td>\r\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Moving Day</td>\r\n<td>Jeff Goldblum</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Lil Wayne</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Audi</td>\r\n<td>Commander</td>\r\n<td>David Bowie (song)</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Avocados From Mexico</td>\r\n<td>AVOS in Space</td>\r\n<td>Scott Baio</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Bud Light</td>\r\n<td rowspan=\"4\">The Bud Light Party</td>\r\n<td>Amy Schumer</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Michael Pena</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Paul Rudd</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Seth Rogan</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Bud Light</td>\r\n<td>Party Message</td>\r\n<td>Michael Pena</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Bud Light</td>\r\n<td rowspan=\"2\">The Bud Light Party is Coming</td>\r\n<td>Amy Schumer</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Seth Rogan</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Budweiser</td>\r\n<td>Give a Damn</td>\r\n<td>Helen Mirren</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Butterfinger</td>\r\n<td>The Motorcross Jump</td>\r\n<td>Billy Eichner</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Disney</td>\r\n<td>Alice in Wonderland Trailer</td>\r\n<td>Alan Rickman (voice over)</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Doritos</td>\r\n<td>Swipe for Doritos</td>\r\n<td>Doris Roberts</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Heinz</td>\r\n<td>Wiener Stampede</td>\r\n<td>Harry Nilsson (song)</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Honda</td>\r\n<td>New Truck to Love</td>\r\n<td>Queen (song)</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Hyundai</td>\r\n<td rowspan=\"2\">First Date</td>\r\n<td>Kevin Hart</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Queen (song)</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Hyundai</td>\r\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Ryanville</td>\r\n<td>Ryan Reynolds</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Salt N' Peppa (song)</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Kia</td>\r\n<td>Walken Closet</td>\r\n<td>Christopher Walken</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>LG</td>\r\n<td>Man From the Future</td>\r\n<td>Liam Neeson</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">MINI</td>\r\n<td rowspan=\"6\">Defy Labelsundefined</td>\r\n<td>Abby Wambach</td>\r\n<td>Athlete</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Harvey Keitel</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Randy Johnson</td>\r\n<td>Athlete</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Serena Williams[/entity]</td>\r\n<td>Athlete</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>T-Pain</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Tony Hawk</td>\r\n<td>Athlete</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Mobile Strike</td>\r\n<td>Fight (Teaser)</td>\r\n<td>Arnold Schwarzenegger</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>NFL Super Bowl</td>\r\n<td>Super Bowl Babies Choir</td>\r\n<td>Seal</td>\r\n<td>Musician</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Pepsi</td>\r\n<td>Camp Halftime: Episode 1 (Teaser)</td>\r\n<td>Donald Faison</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Pepsi</td>\r\n<td>Camp Halftime: Episode 2 (Teaser)</td>\r\n<td>Donald Faison</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Pepsi</td>\r\n<td>Camp Halftime: Episode 3 (Teaser)</td>\r\n<td>Donald Faison</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Persil ProClean</td>\r\n<td>Big Game (Teaser)</td>\r\n<td>Peter Hermann</td>\r\n<td>Actor</td>\r\n</tr><tr><td>Shock Top</td>\r\n<td>Unfiltered Talk</td>\r\n<td>T.J.

ALERT – This article shows and talks about ads that will run during the 2016 Super Bowl. It airs at 6:30pm ET on CBS</em></p>\n<p>From babies in the womb trying to get to Doritos, to Wiener Dogs dressed as hot dogs racing to condiments to an elderly woman doing insane yoga, this year’s Super Bowl ads will have something for everyone.</p>\n<p>Last year was, for lack of a better term, the “Year of the Weepy.” There were several that were designed to pluck at your heartstrings maybe none more so than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRVslkan08U\">Nationwide Insurance’s ad</a> showing a young boy’s life saying he couldn’t do the&nbsp;things you see like getting married because he died in an accident. The ad&nbsp;was deemed not only one that went too far, but exploitive.</p>\n<p>And while there are ads packed with emotions this year, maybe the biggest thing is, no matter the product, advertisers are willing to spend the extra bucks on celebrities to make you, the consumer, stand up and take notice. After all, with ad costs reaching a record $5 million per 30 second spot, what’s a bit more to make sure you remember it long after the Big Game is over?</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>According to iSpot.tv, this year sees 40 ads that feature celebrities in one form or other (<strong><em>see the end of the article for the full list</em></strong>). They range from background soundtracks (Van Halen, to the late David Bowie) to musicians as actors (Steven Tyler to Drake) to athletes (Dan Marino to Randy Johnson and Tony Hawk) to the stately (Helen Mirren absolutely killing it in a Budweiser ad on driving drunk).</p>\n<p>Not all ads are released prior to the game, but many are to gain impressions online. Here’s the best celebrity ads:</p>\n<p><strong>KIA Optima’s “Walken Closet”</strong></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>When it comes to cult of personality, Christopher Walken has to be one at the top. He’s that fantastic blend of “odd” coupled with fierce hilarity (how many recall “The Continental” on Saturday Night Live?). So, when carmaker KIA hits a play on words where a husband asks his wife where his beige socks are, she of course tells him to look in the walk-in closet.</p>\n<p>When he walks in, he’s shocked to find (you got it) Walken.</p>\n<p>“There are two types of people in this world,” Walken tells the man as he holds up the bland pair of socks. “Those who are content to blend in; those who walk through life like beige socks, uninspired and bored. And there are those who expect more,” as he raises his other hand cloaked in a flashy polka dot sock that Walken uses hilariously throughout the rest of the ad.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\"> \n <iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9r0FrXXKeiA\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</div>\n<p><strong>Amazon Echo – Alec Baldwin And Cheese Footballs</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Baldwin has been a regular pitch man, so what makes his ad one of the tops? How about cheese footballs?</p>\n<p>Baldwin seems to be channeling a bit of his <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> character in this one as he dresses down the chefs for what can only be his big Super Bowl party. He never says anything about winners getting steak knives, but he could and it would seem to fit right in.</p>\n<p>But what makes the ad so great is, A) Cheese footballs, and; B) His reference to Deflategate. No word if NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell gave it a thumbs down.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\"> \n <iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EwVzgRfPoU8\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</div>\n<p><strong>Audi R8 – “Commander” Commercial And David Bowie Soundtrack</strong></p>\n<p>Like I said, not all ads are going for laughs this year. After all, whether it’s laughs or heartstrings, the idea is an ad evokes emotion.</p>\n<p>Audi will assuredly be high on all the lists this year with its “Commander” ad. The ad hits home on a number of levels: its theme is around the great space programs of the 1960s when we seemed to be capable of anything, the sadness of the despondent elderly, and how a car as electric as the R8 is a combination of a rocket ship and a way to bring joy back into the old astronaut’s life. Oh, and did we mention that it uses the late David Bowie’s “Starman” as the soundtrack? It’s an incredible blend that fans should make sure and see when it airs.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\"> \n <iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/diU_09jb4bI\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</div>\n<p><strong>Budweiser – Helen Mirren’s “Give A Damn”</strong></p>\n<p>Stately. Shakespearean. Helen Mirren is one of Britain’s most accomplished actors. But much like Meryl Streep, Mirren has found some comedic stride later him her career, most notably with the <em>Red</em> series of films.</p>\n<p>For the Budweiser ad, Mirren is simply set in a restaurant with the decidedly All-American, Super Bowl fan meal: cheeseburger, fries, and of course, a long-neck bottle of Bud.</p>\n<p>But what sets this ad apart is how this coupling with Mirren allows her to get away with calling drunk drivers out and yet somehow making it all seem so incredibly proper.</p>\n<p>It starts off by saying she’s a “notoriously frank and British lady.” She then goes on with such properness to dress down those that get behind the wheel drunk.</p>\n<p>“I sum it up like this: If you drive drunk, you—simply put—are a short-sighted, oxygen-wasting, human form of pollution.”</p>\n<p>There’s more of this incredible goodness which ends with&nbsp;her tipping back and take a swig of the Bud at the end. How very proper.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\"> \n <iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Rb2VXVmUga4\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</div>\n<p><strong>Squarespace – The Key And Peele “Real Talk” series</strong></p>\n<p>There’s always an advertiser that doubles down on Super Bowl advertisement, and this year, it’s Squarespace with the outstanding comedic duo, Key and Peele. The ad series has three teasers, plus the true “Real Talk” ad. Maybe it’s not ad libbed, but if it isn’t, they had to write it. The key here is, you need to catch them all. Seriously funny.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\"> \n <iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3VQkqkTEz4w\"
