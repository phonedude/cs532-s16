And there are already signs that the party online will be bigger than ever for Super Bowl 50. Here&rsquo;s what fans and businesses should watch for.\r\n\r\nIt helps to visualize what happened last year. During&nbsp;<a href=\"http://media.fb.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-on-facebook\" target=\"_blank\">Super Bowl XLIX</a><span>,</span> 65 million unique people joined the Facebook conversation with 265 million posts, comments and likes, making it the most-discussed sporting event globally in 2015. Likewise, it was the most tweeted Super Bowl so far, with 36 million tweets in between 3 hours before and after the game, and a crazy number of impressions: 2.5 billion.\r\n\r\nYou will find different content on each platform, because they are different. Facebook has about 1.6 billion active monthly users, compared to Twitter&rsquo;s 310 million, but Facebook&rsquo;s conversations tend to be more friendly and private while Twitter is a public platform<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2016/02/05/twitters-super-bowl-ad-advantage/#2715e4857a0b35a395eb1878\" target=\"_blank\"> amenable for live-tweeting</a> during events.\r\n\r\n<strong>How To Join The Super Bowl Ad Party</strong>\r\n<p class=\"tweet_line\">[tweet_quote display=\"If you are interested in conversations about Super Bowl ads, Twitter&nbsp;will&nbsp;have a bigger party.\"]If you are interested in conversations about Super Bowl ads, Twitter&nbsp;will&nbsp;have a bigger party.[/tweet_quote] Last year, Super Bowl ads had 1.5 million mentions on Twitter (half of the&nbsp;ads contained a hashtag), compared to Facebook&rsquo;s 360,000. It&rsquo;s easier and cheaper for advertisers to tweet in conversations real-time. This year, you will find plenty of custom-made tweets, Super Bowl ads, and game videos posted live by @NFL, or you can&nbsp;join the party at #SB50 and @TwitterSports. And want to preview Super Bowl ads right now? Go to YouTube&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/adblitz\" target=\"_blank\">AdBlitz</a>, where last year alone people watched 1,600 years of Super Bowl ads.\r\n\r\nBut Facebook is pushing ahead too. It is offering tailor-made Super Bowl targeted groups to advertisers. Also, in January it launched&nbsp;<a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/01/facebook-sports-stadium/\">Facebook Sports Stadium</a>, a dedicated sports page that collects all of the Facebook activity about American football in one place (other sports coming later). A recent article in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/01/facebook-takes-on-twitter-and-espn-with-new-sports-feature/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired</a> says this new feature may make it hard for @TwitterSports to keep up during the Super Bowl: &ldquo;Fans can follow games, get live stats, see what their friends are saying, and view expert commentary from journalists, the leagues, and the teams. With this new tool, Facebook is making a more concerted effort to convince advertisers that Facebook is a valuable resource for targeting sports fans on game day.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_19a54bddf93144b1beb8fd5c86721f14\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-19a54bddf93144b1beb8fd5c86721f14\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/19a54bddf93144b1beb8fd5c86721f14/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"671\" data-width=\"960\"> In this Jan. 31, 2016 photo, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton gets off the plane at the Mineta San Jose International Airport in San Jose, Calif.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>The Party&nbsp;About The Game Itself</strong>\r\n\r\nGiven the massive size of social media activity during the Super Bowl, social media analytics can help visualize how big the Super Bowl TV audience will be and how fans will connect online&nbsp;during the game. A <a href=\"http://media.fb.com/2016/02/03/facebook-nielsen-nfl-tune-in/\" target=\"_blank\">fresh study</a> of nine 2015 NFL games by Nielsen and Facebook showed that shares and posts were a strong estimator of the game&rsquo;s first-minute TV audience. In fact, they found that an increase of one post within the 15 minute period before the game correlated to approximately 250 additional viewers in the first minute, while an additional share correlated to 1,000 viewers in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nNielsen also found that [tweet_quote display=\"there is a positive relationship between Facebook shares and subsequent increases in TV viewership\"]there is a positive relationship between Facebook shares and subsequent increases in TV viewership[/tweet_quote] &nbsp;even after kickoff, and that Facebook chatter extends the life of live NFL games after they end. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/danreedsports\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Reed</a>, Head of Global Sports Partnerships at Facebook said: &ldquo;NFL fans join the social conversation on Facebook in real time during a live game, and then continue to discuss their favorite moments, plays and players after the final whistle blows.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSo &ldquo;where&rdquo; will the online party happen during the game? Globally, last year <a href=\"http://media.fb.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-on-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\">the top five countries</a> talking about the Super Bowl on Facebook were U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Ireland. Interestingly, the top three demographics were women 25-34, 35-44, and 18-24, so women are the online party enthusiasts. Men 25-34 and 18-24 came in fourth and fifth, respectively. Notice women 35-44 came in second so it&rsquo;s not just a party for millennials. Nevertheless, millennials are driving the trend: 1 out 3 viewers is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2016/02/04/the-seismic-digital-shift-in-how-the-super-bowl-is-being-watched/#2715e4857a0b4797e4d44d14\" target=\"_blank\">likely to watch part of the game</a> on something other than TV, and 50% of these are millennials.\r\n\r\nRegarding friendships and interactions, obviously friends who are fans&nbsp;of the same team will interact heavily. But it turns out 59% of Facebook's NFL fan friendships are not between fans of the same team. The following Facebook map shows these cross-team friendships, with connections (or edges) between each NFL team fan base and its&nbsp;top three most important friendship cities. Friends tend to be close geographically. During&nbsp;Super Bowl 50, you will see Denver Broncos fans interacting heavily with Arizona Cardinals, Chicago Bears, and Dallas Cowboys fan friends. Carolina Panthers fans will interact heavily with neighboring team fan friends, like Atlanta Falcons and Washington Redskins fans.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1700\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-1700\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/nelsongranados/files/2016/02/SuperBowlPre-FacebookFanMap2.png-1200x774.jpg\" alt=\"Friendships of NFL fans on Facebook, across teams.

The three most important friendship cities or \"edges\" for each team's fan base are drawn. (Courtesy: Facebook)[/caption]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the intensity of this year&rsquo;s online party will depend on the dynamics of the game itself. Last year was one of the most exciting Super Bowls. This Twitter conversation heat map was captured&nbsp;during&nbsp;the Patriot&rsquo;s second touchdown, with a lot of tweets in the East Coast (showing excited Patriot fans chattering with their East Coast friends) and very few from Seahawks fans. Another good game in&nbsp;Super Bowl 50 is bound to create hot interaction&nbsp;maps like this one.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1647\" align=\"\" width=\"760\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1647\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/nelsongranados/files/2016/02/SuperBowlPre-Twitterheatmap-e1454732160245.png\" alt=\"Super Bowl 2015 Twitter conversation during the Patriot's second touchdown. (Source: Twitter)\" data-height=\"408\" data-width=\"760\"> Super Bowl 2015 Twitter conversation heat map during the Patriot's second touchdown. (Source: Twitter)[/caption]\r\n\r\nEither way, the party should be fun. And I didn&rsquo;t even touch on other emerging video and photo platforms that will merge the online and offline parties in very interesting ways. For example, you can join the party at the stadium by watching Vine videos and Instragram photos, and&nbsp;for the first time&nbsp;enjoy live stadium&nbsp;streams via Twitter&rsquo;s Periscope, Facebook Live, Meerkat, and MeVee (as long as the streams don&rsquo;t violate copyright). The virtual party scene will be massive, and worth exploring. Don&rsquo;t miss it! <!--donotpaginate--></p>","description":"Super Bowl 50's second screen on social media will be a blast.

And there are already signs that the party online will be bigger than ever for Super Bowl 50. Here’s what fans and businesses should watch for.</p>\n<p>It helps to visualize what happened last year. During&nbsp;<a href=\"http://media.fb.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-on-facebook\" target=\"_blank\">Super Bowl XLIX</a><span>,</span> 65 million unique people joined the Facebook conversation with 265 million posts, comments and likes, making it the most-discussed sporting event globally in 2015. Likewise, it was the most tweeted Super Bowl so far, with 36 million tweets in between 3 hours before and after the game, and a crazy number of impressions: 2.5 billion.</p>\n<p>You will find different content on each platform, because they are different. Facebook has about 1.6 billion active monthly users, compared to Twitter’s 310 million, but Facebook’s conversations tend to be more friendly and private while Twitter is a public platform<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2016/02/05/twitters-super-bowl-ad-advantage/#2715e4857a0b35a395eb1878\" target=\"_self\"> amenable for live-tweeting</a> during events.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Join The Super Bowl Ad Party</strong></p>\n<p class=\"tweet_line\"><span class=\"tweet_quote\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1nOerqV&amp;text=If%20you%20are%20interested%20in%20conversations%20about%20Super%20Bowl%20ads%2C%20Twitter%C2%A0will%C2%A0have%20a%20bigger%20party.\" target=\"_blank\">If you are interested in conversations about Super Bowl ads, Twitter&nbsp;will&nbsp;have a bigger party.<span></span></a></span> Last year, Super Bowl ads had 1.5 million mentions on Twitter (half of the&nbsp;ads contained a hashtag), compared to Facebook’s 360,000. It’s easier and cheaper for advertisers to tweet in conversations real-time. This year, you will find plenty of custom-made tweets, Super Bowl ads, and game videos posted live by @NFL, or you can&nbsp;join the party at #SB50 and @TwitterSports. And want to preview Super Bowl ads right now? Go to YouTube’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/adblitz\" target=\"_blank\">AdBlitz</a>, where last year alone people watched 1,600 years of Super Bowl ads.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>But Facebook is pushing ahead too. It is offering tailor-made Super Bowl targeted groups to advertisers. Also, in January it launched&nbsp;<a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/01/facebook-sports-stadium/\">Facebook Sports Stadium</a>, a dedicated sports page that collects all of the Facebook activity about American football in one place (other sports coming later). A recent article in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/01/facebook-takes-on-twitter-and-espn-with-new-sports-feature/\" target=\"_blank\">Wired</a> says this new feature may make it hard for @TwitterSports to keep up during the Super Bowl: “Fans can follow games, get live stats, see what their friends are saying, and view expert commentary from journalists, the leagues, and the teams. With this new tool, Facebook is making a more concerted effort to convince advertisers that Facebook is a valuable resource for targeting sports fans on game day.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19a54bddf93144b1beb8fd5c86721f14\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-19a54bddf93144b1beb8fd5c86721f14\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/19a54bddf93144b1beb8fd5c86721f14/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"671\" data-width=\"960\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In this Jan. 31, 2016 photo, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton gets off the plane at the Mineta San Jose International Airport in San Jose, Calif.

Newton was snapped Sunday in the zebra stripe, gold swirl rocker pants immediately setting social media and TV talking heads into a frenzy. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)</p> \n</div>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>The Party&nbsp;About The Game Itself</strong></p>\n<p>Given the massive size of social media activity during the Super Bowl, social media analytics can help visualize how big the Super Bowl TV audience will be and how fans will connect online&nbsp;during the game. A <a href=\"http://media.fb.com/2016/02/03/facebook-nielsen-nfl-tune-in/\" target=\"_blank\">fresh study</a> of nine 2015 NFL games by Nielsen and Facebook showed that shares and posts were a strong estimator of the game’s first-minute TV audience. In fact, they found that an increase of one post within the 15 minute period before the game correlated to approximately 250 additional viewers in the first minute, while an additional share correlated to 1,000 viewers in the same time frame.</p>\n<p>Nielsen also found that <span class=\"tweet_quote\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1nOerqV&amp;text=there%20is%20a%20positive%20relationship%20between%20Facebook%20shares%20and%20subsequent%20increases%20in%20TV%20viewership\" target=\"_blank\">there is a positive relationship between Facebook shares and subsequent increases in TV viewership<span></span></a></span> &nbsp;even after kickoff, and that Facebook chatter extends the life of live NFL games after they end. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/danreedsports\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Reed</a>, Head of Global Sports Partnerships at Facebook said: “NFL fans join the social conversation on Facebook in real time during a live game, and then continue to discuss their favorite moments, plays and players after the final whistle blows.”</p>\n<p>So “where” will the online party happen during the game? Globally, last year <a href=\"http://media.fb.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-on-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\">the top five countries</a> talking about the Super Bowl on Facebook were U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Ireland. Interestingly, the top three demographics were women 25-34, 35-44, and 18-24, so women are the online party enthusiasts. Men 25-34 and 18-24 came in fourth and fifth, respectively. Notice women 35-44 came in second so it’s not just a party for millennials. Nevertheless, millennials are driving the trend: 1 out 3 viewers is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2016/02/04/the-seismic-digital-shift-in-how-the-super-bowl-is-being-watched/#2715e4857a0b4797e4d44d14\" target=\"_self\">likely to watch part of the game</a> on something other than TV, and 50% of these are millennials.</p>\n<p>Regarding friendships and interactions, obviously friends who are fans&nbsp;of the same team will interact heavily. But it turns out 59% of Facebook’s NFL fan friendships are not between fans of the same team. The following Facebook map shows these cross-team friendships, with connections (or edges) between each NFL team fan base and its&nbsp;top three most important friendship cities. Friends tend to be close geographically. During&nbsp;Super Bowl 50, you will see Denver Broncos fans interacting heavily with Arizona Cardinals, Chicago Bears, and Dallas Cowboys fan friends. Carolina Panthers fans will interact heavily with neighboring team fan friends, like Atlanta Falcons and Washington Redskins fans.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1700\"> \n <img class=\"size-large wp-image-1700\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/nelsongranados/files/2016/02/SuperBowlPre-FacebookFanMap2.png-1200x774.jpg\" alt=\"Friendships of NFL fans on Facebook, across teams.

The three most important friendship cities or “edges” for each team’s fan base are drawn. (Courtesy: Facebook)</p> \n</div>\n<p>But perhaps the intensity of this year’s online party will depend on the dynamics of the game itself. Last year was one of the most exciting Super Bowls. This Twitter conversation heat map was captured&nbsp;during&nbsp;the Patriot’s second touchdown, with a lot of tweets in the East Coast (showing excited Patriot fans chattering with their East Coast friends) and very few from Seahawks fans. Another good game in&nbsp;Super Bowl 50 is bound to create hot interaction&nbsp;maps like this one.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1647\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1647\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/nelsongranados/files/2016/02/SuperBowlPre-Twitterheatmap-e1454732160245.png\" alt=\"Super Bowl 2015 Twitter conversation during the Patriot's second touchdown.

(Source: Twitter)</p> \n</div>\n<p>Either way, the party should be fun. And I didn’t even touch on other emerging video and photo platforms that will merge the online and offline parties in very interesting ways. For example, you can join the party at the stadium by watching Vine videos and Instragram photos, and&nbsp;for the first time&nbsp;enjoy live stadium&nbsp;streams via Twitter’s Periscope, Facebook Live, Meerkat, and MeVee (as long as the streams don’t violate copyright). The virtual party scene will be massive, and worth exploring.
