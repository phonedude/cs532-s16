Super Bowl Sunday has become an \"unofficial\" holiday for many people. The 50th Super Bowl is being held in Santa Clara, California. A recent article at <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/super-bowl-50-el-nino-forecast\">Weather.com caught my eye because it asked the question, \"Will El Ni&ntilde;o Help Soak the Super Bowl?</a>&nbsp;It is not an unreasonable question given the history of El Nino and wet conditions in California. According to <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/super-bowl-50-el-nino-forecast\">Weather Channel meteorologist Jon Erdman</a>,\r\n</p><blockquote>Four out of five strong El Ni&ntilde;o Februaries were wetter than average in the Bay Area....Taking an average of all five Februaries above, you'd expect measurable rain 16 days of the month. In other words, you're more likely to see a wet February day during a strong El Ni&ntilde;o in the Bay Area than a dry day.</blockquote>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_156271355\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-156271355\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/156271355/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" data-width=\"960\"> CHARLOTTE, NC - NOVEMBER 11: A general view of the Denver Broncos versus the Carolina Panthers during their game at Bank of America Stadium on November 11, 2012 in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, weather patterns actually seem favorable at this time for dry conditions for the game, but you should continue to watch the forecast as the game gets closer. I can't help but notice the irony of the iconic <em>50th</em> Super Bowl happening in California during <a href=\"http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/el-nino-to-be-one-of-strongest/50081969\">one of the more iconic&nbsp;El Ninos on record</a>. By the way, Denver Broncos Tight End Owen Daniels is a degreed meteorologist and former guest on the Weather Channel show Weather Geeks.\r\n\r\nBut I digress. I started&nbsp;thinking about weather in previous Super Bowl <a href='http://www.forbes.com/games/'>games</a>.&nbsp;It turns out that William Schmitz of the <a href=\"https://www.sercc.com\">Southeast Regional Climate Center (SERCC)</a> has conducted a Super Bowl Climatology. In other words, he has conducted an analysis of weather statistics for all of the Super Bowls.<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-climate-change-58.html\"> Climate is often defined as long-term average weather</a> for a location. However, I prefer to define climate as the long-term statistical properties of weather for a location, which includes average, extremes, frequency, maxima, minima, and so on. Or as I like to say, \"Weather is your Mood, Climate is Your Personality.\" Anyhow, let's talk Super Bowl weather.\r\n\r\n<em>Some weather and climate facts about the Super Bowl according to the SRCC table below</em>:\r\n<ul><li>17 of 49 Bowls were played indoors (34.7%)</li>\r\n\t<li>18 of 49 Bowls had a Trace or More of Rain at nearby AP(37%)</li>\r\n\t<li>2 Bowls had Snow on Game Day (1982,2006)</li>\r\n\t<li>1 Bowl was played during an Ice Storm (2000)</li>\r\n\t<li>Warmest High Temperature of 82&deg; (1973,2003)</li>\r\n\t<li>Coldest High Temp for Dome Game 16&deg; (1982)</li>\r\n\t<li>Coldest High Temp for Non-Dome Game 43&deg; (1972)</li>\r\n\t<li>Wettest Super Bowl .92 inches of rain (2007)</li>\r\n\t<li>Outside Games With High Wind Gust (1980, 1984, 1989,2007)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_805\" align=\"\" width=\"770\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-805\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/marshallshepherd/files/2016/01/screenshot_174.png\" alt=\"Super Bowl Climatology Courtesy of the Southeast Regional Climate Center/UNCC and W.

Courtesy of the Southeast Regional Climate Center/UNCC and used with permission of W. Schmitz, https://www.sercc.com/SuperBowlClimate.pdf[/caption]\r\n\r\nI remember the 48th Super Bowl very well because it was on the same Sunday that the American Meteorological Society's (AMS) Annual Conference was kicking off in Atlanta, Georgia. I was the President of the AMS at that time, and there was quite a bit of \"buzz\" about the Super Bowl because it was &nbsp;the \"northernmost\" outdoor Super Bowl location. The game was played in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Climatologically, the chances for wintry conditions were quite high.<a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/08/super-bowl-snow-storm-new-york\"> One almanac even predicted a major winter storm on game day</a>&nbsp;(By the way, s<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2015/08/16/ten-common-myths-and-misperceptions-about-the-science-of-weather/#88cf3e713350\">ee my previous articles for a discussion of my thoughts on almanacs forecasts</a>). As it turns out, the game was played under relatively mild conditions with a temperature of 48&deg; at kickoff.\r\n\r\nAs fascinating as these facts are, if you want to find out other interesting things about weather and the Super Bowl, <a href=\"http://www.sercc.com/sports\">the SERCC has a sports-focused site</a>&nbsp;that provides information such as:\r\n<ul><li>Rain for Super Bowl (a predictor tool created by San Jose Mercury News based on SERCC data)?</li>\r\n\t<li>Super Bowl Weather Web Query Tool (created by Long Island Newsday with SERCC data)</li>\r\n\t<li>Super Bowl Temperatures The Past 10 Years (created by The Arizona Republic with SERCC data)</li>\r\n\t<li>Super Bowl 50 Climate Summary for 2/7/2016 - Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, [entity display=\"CA\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"ca\" ticker=\"CA\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/742\"]CA[/entity]</li>\r\n\t<li>Super Bowl XLVIII Weather: A honest look (by Chief Meteorologist Brad Panovich(@wxbrad) at WCNC)</li>\r\n\t<li>The Weather Channel's : Five Beast &amp; Worst NFL Weather Cities</li>\r\n\t<li>Coldest games in NFL history</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI queried my colleague William Schmitz of SERCC about the upcoming Super Bowl, and he mentioned in a message,\r\n<blockquote>I did the story with the San Jose Mercury news and I discovered that California has hosted the Super Bowl in now 3 El Ni&ntilde;o winters since 1967 and no rain fell on those days.</blockquote>\r\nHistory seems to be on the side of fans of a dry game and so do the latest NOAA Climate Prediction Precipitation Outlooks for the period. Enjoy the game.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_808\" align=\"\" width=\"719\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-808\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/marshallshepherd/files/2016/01/610prcp.new_.gif\" alt=\"Courtesy of NOAA CPC.\" data-height=\"759\" data-width=\"719\"> Courtesy of NOAA CPC.[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong><em>WATCH: How Much Is Super Bowl 50 Worth?</em></strong>\r\n\r\n[brightcove videoID=4728591536001]","description":"February has Valentine's Day, but it also has the Super Bowl.

Super Bowl Sunday has become an “unofficial” holiday for many people. The 50th Super Bowl is being held in Santa Clara, California. A recent article at <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/super-bowl-50-el-nino-forecast\">Weather.com caught my eye because it asked the question, “Will El Ni&ntilde;o Help Soak the Super Bowl?</a>&nbsp;It is not an unreasonable question given the history of El Nino and wet conditions in California. According to <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/super-bowl-50-el-nino-forecast\">Weather Channel meteorologist Jon Erdman</a>,</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>Four out of five strong El Ni&ntilde;o Februaries were wetter than average in the Bay Area….Taking an average of all five Februaries above, you’d expect measurable rain 16 days of the month. In other words, you’re more likely to see a wet February day during a strong El Ni&ntilde;o in the Bay Area than a dry day.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_156271355\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-156271355\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/156271355/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" data-width=\"960\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">CHARLOTTE, NC – NOVEMBER 11: A general view of the Denver Broncos versus the Carolina Panthers during their game at Bank of America Stadium on November 11, 2012 in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p>As it turns out, weather patterns actually seem favorable at this time for dry conditions for the game, but you should continue to watch the forecast as the game gets closer. I can’t help but notice the irony of the iconic <em>50th</em> Super Bowl happening in California during <a href=\"http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/el-nino-to-be-one-of-strongest/50081969\">one of the more iconic&nbsp;El Ninos on record</a>. By the way, Denver Broncos Tight End Owen Daniels is a degreed meteorologist and former guest on the Weather Channel show Weather Geeks.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>But I digress. I started&nbsp;thinking about weather in previous Super Bowl <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/games/\" target=\"_self\">games</a>.&nbsp;It turns out that William Schmitz of the <a href=\"https://www.sercc.com\">Southeast Regional Climate Center (SERCC)</a> has conducted a Super Bowl Climatology. In other words, he has conducted an analysis of weather statistics for all of the Super Bowls.<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-climate-change-58.html\"> Climate is often defined as long-term average weather</a> for a location. However, I prefer to define climate as the long-term statistical properties of weather for a location, which includes average, extremes, frequency, maxima, minima, and so on. Or as I like to say, “Weather is your Mood, Climate is Your Personality.” Anyhow, let’s talk Super Bowl weather.</p>\n<p><em>Some weather and climate facts about the Super Bowl according to the SRCC table below</em>:</p>\n<ul> \n <li>17 of 49 Bowls were played indoors (34.7%)</li> \n <div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div> \n <li>18 of 49 Bowls had a Trace or More of Rain at nearby AP(37%)</li> \n <li>2 Bowls had Snow on Game Day (1982,2006)</li> \n <li>1 Bowl was played during an Ice Storm (2000)</li> \n <li>Warmest High Temperature of 82&deg; (1973,2003)</li> \n <li>Coldest High Temp for Dome Game 16&deg; (1982)</li> \n <li>Coldest High Temp for Non-Dome Game 43&deg; (1972)</li> \n <li>Wettest Super Bowl .92 inches of rain (2007)</li> \n <li>Outside Games With High Wind Gust (1980, 1984, 1989,2007)</li> \n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_805\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-805\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/marshallshepherd/files/2016/01/screenshot_174.png\" alt=\"Super Bowl Climatology Courtesy of the Southeast Regional Climate Center/UNCC and W.

Schmitz, https://www.sercc.com/SuperBowlClimate.pdf</p> \n</div>\n<p>I remember the 48th Super Bowl very well because it was on the same Sunday that the American Meteorological Society’s (AMS) Annual Conference was kicking off in Atlanta, Georgia. I was the President of the AMS at that time, and there was quite a bit of “buzz” about the Super Bowl because it was &nbsp;the “northernmost” outdoor Super Bowl location. The game was played in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Climatologically, the chances for wintry conditions were quite high.<a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/08/super-bowl-snow-storm-new-york\"> One almanac even predicted a major winter storm on game day</a>&nbsp;(By the way, s<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2015/08/16/ten-common-myths-and-misperceptions-about-the-science-of-weather/#88cf3e713350\" target=\"_self\">ee my previous articles for a discussion of my thoughts on almanacs forecasts</a>). As it turns out, the game was played under relatively mild conditions with a temperature of 48&deg; at kickoff.</p>\n<p>As fascinating as these facts are, if you want to find out other interesting things about weather and the Super Bowl, <a href=\"http://www.sercc.com/sports\">the SERCC has a sports-focused site</a>&nbsp;that provides information such as:</p>\n<ul> \n <li>Rain for Super Bowl (a predictor tool created by San Jose Mercury News based on SERCC data)?</li> \n <li>Super Bowl Weather Web Query Tool (created by Long Island Newsday with SERCC data)</li> \n <li>Super Bowl Temperatures The Past 10 Years (created by The Arizona Republic with SERCC data)</li> \n <li>Super Bowl 50 Climate Summary for 2/7/2016 – Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"CA\" data-exchange=\"NASDAQ\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/742\" data-quotes-closing=\"27.145\" data-quotes-now=\"27.7\" data-link=\"/companies/ca\" data-name=\"CA\"></span></li> \n <li>Super Bowl XLVIII Weather: A honest look (by Chief Meteorologist Brad Panovich(@wxbrad) at WCNC)</li> \n <li>The Weather Channel’s : Five Beast &amp; Worst NFL Weather Cities</li> \n <li>Coldest games in NFL history</li> \n</ul>\n<p>I queried my colleague William Schmitz of SERCC about the upcoming Super Bowl, and he mentioned in a message,</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p>I did the story with the San Jose Mercury news and I discovered that California has hosted the Super Bowl in now 3 El Ni&ntilde;o winters since 1967 and no rain fell on those days.</p> \n</blockquote>\n<p>History seems to be on the side of fans of a dry game and so do the latest NOAA Climate Prediction Precipitation Outlooks for the period.
