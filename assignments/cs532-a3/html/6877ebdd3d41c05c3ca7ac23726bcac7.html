Apparently, they&rsquo;re engaged in some unconscious manifestation of racism. As the argument goes, we are living in a complex time complete with elaborate social economic pressures, inherent biases and uncontrollable prejudices. Newton bears the brunt of some of this.\r\n\r\nNot buying it. Not by a long shot.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"\" width=\"4634\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/507938474/x.jpg\" alt=\"\"> SAN JOSE, CA - FEBRUARY 01: Cam Newton #1 of the Carolina Panthers addresses the media at Super Bowl Opening Night Fueled by Gatorade at SAP Center on February 1, 2016 in San Jose, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nNewton is not being booed or singled out because he&rsquo;s black. Newton is a target because his personality rubs some people the wrong way. To declare that racism is the cause of this behavior is tedious, trite and convenient. It&rsquo;s also a scathing indictment of&nbsp; players and fans who rather innocuously express negative views about Newton uncomplicated by race. Finally, it also diminishes (albeit unintentionally) the substantial harm, anguish and brutality perpetrated on people of color over centuries.\r\n\r\nNewton is a spectacular and gifted football player. Frankly, he&rsquo;s a freak of nature. He&rsquo;s also incredibly generous with his money and time. He is actively involved with his Foundation that helps underprivileged kids. Handing footballs to kids during games is just the tip of the charitable iceberg for Newton.\r\n\r\nHis teammate Jerricho Cotchery is pretty impressed with Newton.\r\n\r\n\"He's incredible with that, he's completely incredible,\" Cotchery said. \"Really he's a superstar, but the way he interacts with fans and kids is just an unbelievable deal. Some people are burdened by that, but he interacts with fans and children and it's cool to see.\"\r\n\r\nSo if you don&rsquo;t like Newton, you should.\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\nThat being said, he has for some time rubbed people the wrong way. Some find him arrogant, cocky and a showboat. Early in his career, people didn&rsquo;t like that he&rsquo;d celebrate a touchdown with two minutes to go and down by 25. Some don&rsquo;t like his celebratory dance, the Dab. It&rsquo;s selfish, self-indulgent and egocentric. His critics complain that Newton needs to show a bit more deference and humility.\r\n\r\nRace, however, is not the driving force behind this criticism; it&rsquo;s personality. And let&rsquo;s be clear about something: arrogance isn't restricted to one particular group. People across all races and ethnicities suffer from this affliction.\r\n\r\nA casual glance at the North American sports landscape past and present reveals that many African-Americans have been warmly received by fans: Calvin Johnson, Russell Wilson, David Robinson, Sugar Ray Leonard, Kirby Puckett, Tony Gwynn, Julius Erving, Ken Griffey Jr., Reggie White, Barry Sanders, Magic Johnson and Jarome Iginla. Frankly, the list is endless.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there are lots of sports personalities that while not being African-American are still disliked. These include Jay Cutler, Dan Snyder, Dion Phaneuf, Claude Lemieux, Johnny Manziel, Sean Avery, A.J. Pierzynski, Alex Rodriguez, Bryce Harper and John Rocker.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"dam-image ap wp-image-2 size-large\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/2ec17c8292ff45ce8981434c1b951055/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\nSo whether a player is white, black or orange, the key seems to be personality type and how they carry themselves. Skin color, however, as a key catalyst for hating Newton is awkwardly misplaced.\r\n\r\nAnd don&rsquo;t forget we hold our quarterbacks to a different standard. We want them to be focused and driven, yet understated, deferential and team-focused. So a quarterback dancing around the field is not aligned with our expectations of what a quarterback should be. We want less flash more modesty. We want them to be stately and stewards of the game.\r\n\r\nThere are of course going to be people who boo Newton because he&rsquo;s black. In those instances, it&rsquo;s of course racist. But guys like David Duke and Bill Wilkinson aren&rsquo;t what this debate is about.\r\n\r\nBy the way, four of the top ten selling jerseys between April 1, 2015 and January 30, 2016 belonged to African-American players: Newton, Odell Beckham Jr., Russell Wilson and Dez Bryant. Cam is number two on that list behind Tom Brady.\r\n\r\nLast year between March 1 and August 31, 2015, Newton had the 43<sup>rd</sup> best selling jersey just ahead of Ben Roethlisberger and Julian Edelman. At that time, the Panthers were a relatively low profile team that was just starting to emerge as a force. And by the way, who had the best selling jersey during that time? Russell Wilson.\r\n\r\nNewton does have an ego, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. While ego may make some uncomfortable, it&rsquo;s a critical feature of successful players.\r\n\r\nSo here&rsquo;s hoping Newton never changes and keeps on dancing. He truly is a joy to watch.</p>","description":"Some people aren't aware that race is the reason they react to Cam Newton the way they do.

Not by a long shot.</p>\n<div> \n <img class=\"\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/507938474/x.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SAN JOSE, CA – FEBRUARY 01: Cam Newton #1 of the Carolina Panthers addresses the media at Super Bowl Opening Night Fueled by Gatorade at SAP Center on February 1, 2016 in San Jose, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p>Newton is not being booed or singled out because he’s black. Newton is a target because his personality rubs some people the wrong way. To declare that racism is the cause of this behavior is tedious, trite and convenient. It’s also a scathing indictment of&nbsp; players and fans who rather innocuously express negative views about Newton uncomplicated by race. Finally, it also diminishes (albeit unintentionally) the substantial harm, anguish and brutality perpetrated on people of color over centuries.</p>\n<p>Newton is a spectacular and gifted football player. Frankly, he’s a freak of nature. He’s also incredibly generous with his money and time. He is actively involved with his Foundation that helps underprivileged kids. Handing footballs to kids during games is just the tip of the charitable iceberg for Newton.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>His teammate Jerricho Cotchery is pretty impressed with Newton.</p>\n<p>“He’s incredible with that, he’s completely incredible,” Cotchery said. “Really he’s a superstar, but the way he interacts with fans and kids is just an unbelievable deal. Some people are burdened by that, but he interacts with fans and children and it’s cool to see.”</p>\n<p>So if you don’t like Newton, you should.</p>\n<p>That being said, he has for some time rubbed people the wrong way. Some find him arrogant, cocky and a showboat. Early in his career, people didn’t like that he’d celebrate a touchdown with two minutes to go and down by 25. Some don’t like his celebratory dance, the Dab. It’s selfish, self-indulgent and egocentric. His critics complain that Newton needs to show a bit more deference and humility.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Race, however, is not the driving force behind this criticism; it’s personality. And let’s be clear about something: arrogance isn’t restricted to one particular group. People across all races and ethnicities suffer from this affliction.</p>\n<p>A casual glance at the North American sports landscape past and present reveals that many African-Americans have been warmly received by fans: Calvin Johnson, Russell Wilson, David Robinson, Sugar Ray Leonard, Kirby Puckett, Tony Gwynn, Julius Erving, Ken Griffey Jr., Reggie White, Barry Sanders, Magic Johnson and Jarome Iginla. Frankly, the list is endless.</p>\n<p>Similarly, there are lots of sports personalities that while not being African-American are still disliked. These include Jay Cutler, Dan Snyder, Dion Phaneuf, Claude Lemieux, Johnny Manziel, Sean Avery, A.J. Pierzynski, Alex Rodriguez, Bryce Harper and John Rocker.</p>\n<p><img class=\"dam-image ap wp-image-2 size-large\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/2ec17c8292ff45ce8981434c1b951055/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>So whether a player is white, black or orange, the key seems to be personality type and how they carry themselves. Skin color, however, as a key catalyst for hating Newton is awkwardly misplaced.</p>\n<p>And don’t forget we hold our quarterbacks to a different standard. We want them to be focused and driven, yet understated, deferential and team-focused. So a quarterback dancing around the field is not aligned with our expectations of what a quarterback should be. We want less flash more modesty. We want them to be stately and stewards of the game.</p>\n<p>There are of course going to be people who boo Newton because he’s black. In those instances, it’s of course racist. But guys like David Duke and Bill Wilkinson aren’t what this debate is about.</p>\n<p>By the way, four of the top ten selling jerseys between April 1, 2015 and January 30, 2016 belonged to African-American players: Newton, Odell Beckham Jr., Russell Wilson and Dez Bryant. Cam is number two on that list behind Tom Brady.</p>\n<p>Last year between March 1 and August 31, 2015, Newton had the 43<sup>rd</sup> best selling jersey just ahead of Ben Roethlisberger and Julian Edelman. At that time, the Panthers were a relatively low profile team that was just starting to emerge as a force. And by the way, who had the best selling jersey during that time? Russell Wilson.</p>\n<p>Newton does have an ego, but there’s nothing wrong with that. While ego may make some uncomfortable, it’s a critical feature of successful players.</p>\n<p>So here’s hoping Newton never changes and keeps on dancing. He truly is a joy to watch.</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_5","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"SportsMoney","url":"/sportsmoney"}],"pTagCount":20,"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"Cam Newton: It's Not About Race","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3491","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmacramalla/","type":"Contributor Group","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/ericmacramalla/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1455410456399,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3491","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1458840","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1458840","name":"Eric Macramalla","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f54ec5698959e2b657c5b58182873fd6?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f54ec5698959e2b657c5b58182873fd6?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f54ec5698959e2b657c5b58182873fd6?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f54ec5698959e2b657c5b58182873fd6?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover sports law","description":"I'm a partner at a national law firm, where I've practiced for 15 years.
