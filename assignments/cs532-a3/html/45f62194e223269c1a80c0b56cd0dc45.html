What&rsquo;s more, the 114.4 million figure doesn&rsquo;t even include public venues like sports bars, so the real number of viewers is likely to be substantially more.\r\n\r\nWith such vast viewing figures attached and with the added distinction of this year&rsquo;s Super Bowl celebrating the event&rsquo;s 50th birthday, you&rsquo;d think it would go without saying that Super Bowl 50 would be used as a technical showcase for the very latest and greatest technologies the AV world has to offer. But no.<a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2016/02/SuperBowl50Logo.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-2816\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2016/02/SuperBowl50Logo.jpg\" alt=\"SuperBowl50Logo\" data-height=\"475\" data-width=\"650\"></a>\r\n\r\nIt turns out that far from carrying its Super Bowl 50 coverage into the TV <a href='http://www.forbes.com/technology/'>tech</a> end zone, broadcaster [entity display=\"CBS\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"cbs\" ticker=\"CBS\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/826\"]CBS[/entity] has fumbled the ball in midfield. And in doing so it&rsquo;s horribly undermined the ability of a hard-pressed TV hardware industry to cash in on what&rsquo;s traditionally been a welcome opportunity to rake in some healthy extra post-Christmas sales.\r\n\r\n<strong>The next big things</strong>\r\n\r\nThe issue is simply this. Right now the cutting edge of television technology is represented by not one but two &lsquo;game changers&rsquo;: 1) 4K/Ultra HD resolution and 2) high dynamic range (HDR) playback, which offers an expanded luminance range together with, in most incarnations, a wider color gamut. Yet CBS isn&rsquo;t leveraging either of these two showcase technologies for its coverage of this golden anniversary edition of America&rsquo;s most watched sporting event. Instead we&rsquo;re just getting good old high definition. Again.\r\n\r\nWhat&rsquo;s particularly surprising/disappointing about this is that actually neither HDR nor, especially, 4K are still truly new TV technologies. Pretty much every key manufacturer had a range of HDR-capable TVs available in 2015, while 4K TVs arrived on the scene as far back as 2012.\r\n\r\nIn fact, 4K has been around long enough to have already had a significant impact on the TV landscape. 4K TVs have found their way in to millions of US homes, while recent predictions by industry analyst Parks Associates predicts that 330 million 4K UHD TVs will have been sold worldwide by the end of 2019. Not least because prices of 4K TVs are plummeting so far and so fast that it&rsquo;s hard to see there being any space left in the TV market for HD TVs for more than the next couple of TV generations.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2372\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"]<a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/11/SamsungUN40JU7100Angle2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2372\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/11/SamsungUN40JU7100Angle2-1200x800.jpg\" alt=\"Affordable 4K sets like the Samsung UN40JU7100 are helping to accelerate the format's adoption.\" data-height=\"800\" data-width=\"1200\"></a> Affordable 4K sets like the Samsung UN40JU7100 are helping to accelerate the format's adoption.[/caption]\r\n\r\nThis all adds up to to a situation where there are a heck of a lot of 4K TV owners out there already who will rightly be gutted that not even an event as immense as Super Bowl 50 can scratch their 4K itch. Worse, it means there really is precious reason for consumers to see the Super Bowl as an excuse for buying a new TV when that new TV would mostly likely have been a 4K one.\r\n\r\n<strong>Worse, not better</strong>\r\n\r\nIn fact - and here&rsquo;s the kicker - if you buy a new 4K TV ahead of the Super Bowl, it could actually make the picture quality look worse than it would on a good quality HD TV of the sort you likely already have in your living room.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because whenever a 4K TV receives an HD video feed it has to apply heavy duty processing to it to convert it to 4K. And whenever you&rsquo;ve got heavy duty processing involved in producing a video picture, you&rsquo;ve got the potential for all kinds of unpleasantness to be added to the image. Especially when the content is a (hopefully!) action packed sporting event like the Super Bowl 50.\r\n\r\nIn other words, far from being a reason to buy a new TV, Super Bowl 50 is arguably a colossal reason not to.\r\n\r\nIn fact, sticking with HD for Super Bowl 50 broadcasts is arguably just about the biggest advert imaginable for just how poorly the content creation and distribution worlds have done in keeping pace with the world of 4K screen hardware.\r\n\r\nIt also casts a pretty ironic light on LG&rsquo;s debut Super Bowl ad: an extravagantly expensive promotion starring Liam Neeson and directed by Ridley Scott&rsquo;s son Jake extolling the virtues of LG&rsquo;s 4K OLED TVs.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2544\" align=\"\" width=\"670\"]<a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/12/RidleyandJakeScottToMakeLGSuperbowlad.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2544\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/12/RidleyandJakeScottToMakeLGSuperbowlad.jpg\" alt=\"Jake and Ridley Scott have helped LG create its first Super Bowl ad - for a 4K TV...\" data-height=\"446\" data-width=\"670\"></a> Jake and Ridley Scott have helped LG create its first Super Bowl ad - for a 4K TV...[/caption]\r\n\r\nAt this point I should stress that I do have at least a little sympathy for CBS&rsquo;s position. There really are still considerable technical hurdles to getting 4K - especially live 4K - into people&rsquo;s living rooms. Broadcast infrastructure generally still seems way off being able to handle the production and distribution demands of 4K video, especially in the terrestrial (as opposed to satellite) arena. And the internet still struggles in many parts of the US and the wider world to deliver the sort of broadband speeds necessary to serve up anything even approaching a decent 4K video stream.\r\n\r\n<strong>A couple of positives, but...\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s worth pointing out, too, that CBS is at least shooting Super Bowl 50 using 5K cameras, which it&rsquo;s claimed should deliver some boost to picture quality even after their images have been downscaled to HD for distribution. Plus the broadcaster is introducing a new &lsquo;360-degree&rsquo; replay system based on 36 cameras strung around the upper deck of the Santa Clara Levi&rsquo;s Stadium. So the Super Bowl 50 is hardly an innovation-free zone, and the innovations being delivered benefit all viewers rather than a minority with 4K TVs.\r\n\r\nNone of this can disguise the facts, though, that 4K TVs have been around for nearly four years while the Super Bowl 50 has been coming for, well, 50 years. So nobody can say CBS hasn&rsquo;t had plenty of time to prepare for the technical challenges of making Super Bowl 50 a technical tour de force.\r\n\r\n<strong>If Canada can do it...</strong>\r\n\r\nCanada delivered its first live 4K broadcast of an ice hockey game on January 23rd this year, and the Toronto Raptors basketball games are also expected to become regular 4K TV events. So if Canada can do this with sports events which are, without wishing to offend fans of any of the Canadian teams involved, far less massive events than the 50th Super Bowl, it&rsquo;s really hard to understand why CBS couldn&rsquo;t manage to pull something similar together somewhere across its distribution network.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1079\" align=\"\" width=\"645\"]<a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/02/Samsung65JS9500Angled.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1079\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/02/Samsung65JS9500Angled.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung's JS9500 TV series introduced the world to the joys of HDR back in 2015.\" data-height=\"420\" data-width=\"645\"></a> Samsung's JS9500 TV series introduced the world to the joys of HDR back in 2015.[/caption]\r\n\r\nAnd then there&rsquo;s HDR. While HDR is a much newer arrival to the TV party than 4K, I have it on good authority from more than one broadcaster that HDR is easier to create and far easier to distribute than 4K, as it requires much less extra delivery bandwidth. So would it really have been too much to ask that Super Bowl 50 was at least broadcast in HDR to underline the occasion&rsquo;s tent-pole status? Even if there aren&rsquo;t currently that many TVs capable of handling it?\r\n\r\nAs a passionate advocate of the dual picture joys of true 4K and HDR, I&rsquo;d still urge anyone in the market for a new TV generally to make that new TV both 4K- and HDR-ready. But if you&rsquo;re one of the supposedly hundreds of thousands of people expressly wanting to buy a new TV just to enhance the action when the Panthers and the Broncos take to the field on February 7th, my advice sadly has to be that you should hold fire until a much more compelling reason comes along.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>WATCH: How Much Is Super Bowl 50 Worth?</em></strong>\r\n\r\n[brightcove videoID=4728591536001]</p>","description":"You’ve already got everything you need.","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2016/02/SuperBowl50Logo.jpg","imageHeight":475,"imageWidth":650,"type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2016/02/02/super-bowl-50-tech-fail-why-you-shouldnt-buy-a-new-tv-for-americas-biggest-sporting-event/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"3324","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1315068","name":"John Archer","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7df78311ee3b40fa4df55e327aacf25?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":40,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7df78311ee3b40fa4df55e327aacf25?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7df78311ee3b40fa4df55e327aacf25?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7df78311ee3b40fa4df55e327aacf25?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/johnarcher/","twitterName":"bigjohnnyarcher","authorType":"individual","email":"jarcherfreelance@btinternet.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about TVs, projectors and other home entertainment technology.","timestamp":1455410426026,"description":"I've spent the past 20 years writing about the world of home entertainment technology--first at Home Cinema Choice magazine, where I became Deputy Editor, and for the past 17 years on a freelance basis.

Super Bowl isn’t just the tent-pole event of America’s vast sporting obsession; it’s also a veritable TV viewing phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Last year’s tussle between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks raked in an estimated 114.4 million viewers, with a reach into almost 50% of American homes. What’s more, the 114.4 million figure doesn’t even include public venues like sports bars, so the real number of viewers is likely to be substantially more.</p>\n<p>With such vast viewing figures attached and with the added distinction of this year’s Super Bowl celebrating the event’s 50th birthday, you’d think it would go without saying that Super Bowl 50 would be used as a technical showcase for the very latest and greatest technologies the AV world has to offer. But no.<a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2016/02/SuperBowl50Logo.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-2816\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2016/02/SuperBowl50Logo.jpg\" alt=\"SuperBowl50Logo\" data-height=\"475\" data-width=\"650\" /></a></p>\n<p>It turns out that far from carrying its Super Bowl 50 coverage into the TV <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/technology/\" target=\"_self\">tech</a> end zone, broadcaster <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"CBS\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/826\" data-quotes-closing=\"43.57\" data-quotes-now=\"43.18\" data-link=\"/companies/cbs\" data-name=\"CBS\"></span> has fumbled the ball in midfield. And in doing so it’s horribly undermined the ability of a hard-pressed TV hardware industry to cash in on what’s traditionally been a welcome opportunity to rake in some healthy extra post-Christmas sales.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>The next big things</strong></p>\n<p>The issue is simply this. Right now the cutting edge of television technology is represented by not one but two ‘game changers’: 1) 4K/Ultra HD resolution and 2) high dynamic range (HDR) playback, which offers an expanded luminance range together with, in most incarnations, a wider color gamut. Yet CBS isn’t leveraging either of these two showcase technologies for its coverage of this golden anniversary edition of America’s most watched sporting event. Instead we’re just getting good old high definition. Again.</p>\n<p>What’s particularly surprising/disappointing about this is that actually neither HDR nor, especially, 4K are still truly new TV technologies. Pretty much every key manufacturer had a range of HDR-capable TVs available in 2015, while 4K TVs arrived on the scene as far back as 2012.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>In fact, 4K has been around long enough to have already had a significant impact on the TV landscape. 4K TVs have found their way in to millions of US homes, while recent predictions by industry analyst Parks Associates predicts that 330 million 4K UHD TVs will have been sold worldwide by the end of 2019. Not least because prices of 4K TVs are plummeting so far and so fast that it’s hard to see there being any space left in the TV market for HD TVs for more than the next couple of TV generations.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2372\"> \n <a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/11/SamsungUN40JU7100Angle2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2372\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/11/SamsungUN40JU7100Angle2-1200x800.jpg\" alt=\"Affordable 4K sets like the Samsung UN40JU7100 are helping to accelerate the format's adoption.\" data-height=\"800\" data-width=\"1200\" /></a> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Affordable 4K sets like the Samsung UN40JU7100 are helping to accelerate the format’s adoption.</p> \n</div>\n<p>This all adds up to to a situation where there are a heck of a lot of 4K TV owners out there already who will rightly be gutted that not even an event as immense as Super Bowl 50 can scratch their 4K itch. Worse, it means there really is precious reason for consumers to see the Super Bowl as an excuse for buying a new TV when that new TV would mostly likely have been a 4K one.</p>\n<p><strong>Worse, not better</strong></p>\n<p>In fact – and here’s the kicker – if you buy a new 4K TV ahead of the Super Bowl, it could actually make the picture quality look worse than it would on a good quality HD TV of the sort you likely already have in your living room.</p>\n<p>Why? Because whenever a 4K TV receives an HD video feed it has to apply heavy duty processing to it to convert it to 4K. And whenever you’ve got heavy duty processing involved in producing a video picture, you’ve got the potential for all kinds of unpleasantness to be added to the image. Especially when the content is a (hopefully!) action packed sporting event like the Super Bowl 50.</p>\n<p>In other words, far from being a reason to buy a new TV, Super Bowl 50 is arguably a colossal reason not to.</p>\n<p>In fact, sticking with HD for Super Bowl 50 broadcasts is arguably just about the biggest advert imaginable for just how poorly the content creation and distribution worlds have done in keeping pace with the world of 4K screen hardware.</p>\n<p>It also casts a pretty ironic light on LG’s debut Super Bowl ad: an extravagantly expensive promotion starring Liam Neeson and directed by Ridley Scott’s son Jake extolling the virtues of LG’s 4K OLED TVs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2544\"> \n <a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/12/RidleyandJakeScottToMakeLGSuperbowlad.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2544\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/12/RidleyandJakeScottToMakeLGSuperbowlad.jpg\" alt=\"Jake and Ridley Scott have helped LG create its first Super Bowl ad - for a 4K TV...\" data-height=\"446\" data-width=\"670\" /></a> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jake and Ridley Scott have helped LG create its first Super Bowl ad – for a 4K TV…</p> \n</div>\n<p>At this point I should stress that I do have at least a little sympathy for CBS’s position. There really are still considerable technical hurdles to getting 4K – especially live 4K – into people’s living rooms. Broadcast infrastructure generally still seems way off being able to handle the production and distribution demands of 4K video, especially in the terrestrial (as opposed to satellite) arena. And the internet still struggles in many parts of the US and the wider world to deliver the sort of broadband speeds necessary to serve up anything even approaching a decent 4K video stream.</p>\n<p><strong>A couple of positives, but…</strong></p>\n<strong> </strong>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>It’s worth pointing out, too, that CBS is at least shooting Super Bowl 50 using 5K cameras, which it’s claimed should deliver some boost to picture quality even after their images have been downscaled to HD for distribution. Plus the broadcaster is introducing a new ‘360-degree’ replay system based on 36 cameras strung around the upper deck of the Santa Clara Levi’s Stadium. So the Super Bowl 50 is hardly an innovation-free zone, and the innovations being delivered benefit all viewers rather than a minority with 4K TVs.</p>\n<p>None of this can disguise the facts, though, that 4K TVs have been around for nearly four years while the Super Bowl 50 has been coming for, well, 50 years. So nobody can say CBS hasn’t had plenty of time to prepare for the technical challenges of making Super Bowl 50 a technical tour de force.</p>\n<p><strong>If Canada can do it…</strong></p>\n<p>Canada delivered its first live 4K broadcast of an ice hockey game on January 23rd this year, and the Toronto Raptors basketball games are also expected to become regular 4K TV events. So if Canada can do this with sports events which are, without wishing to offend fans of any of the Canadian teams involved, far less massive events than the 50th Super Bowl, it’s really hard to understand why CBS couldn’t manage to pull something similar together somewhere across its distribution network.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1079\"> \n <a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/02/Samsung65JS9500Angled.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1079\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnarcher/files/2015/02/Samsung65JS9500Angled.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung's JS9500 TV series introduced the world to the joys of HDR back in 2015.\" data-height=\"420\" data-width=\"645\" /></a> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Samsung’s JS9500 TV series introduced the world to the joys of HDR back in 2015.</p> \n</div>\n<p>And then there’s HDR. While HDR is a much newer arrival to the TV party than 4K, I have it on good authority from more than one broadcaster that HDR is easier to create and far easier to distribute than 4K, as it requires much less extra delivery bandwidth. So would it really have been too much to ask that Super Bowl 50 was at least broadcast in HDR to underline the occasion’s tent-pole status? Even if there aren’t currently that many TVs capable of handling it?</p>\n<p>As a passionate advocate of the dual picture joys of true 4K and HDR, I’d still urge anyone in the market for a new TV generally to make that new TV both 4K- and HDR-ready. But if you’re one of the supposedly hundreds of thousands of people expressly wanting to buy a new TV just to enhance the action when the Panthers and the Broncos take to the field on February 7th, my advice sadly has to be that you should hold fire until a much more compelling reason comes along.</p>\n<p><strong><em>WATCH: How Much Is Super Bowl 50 Worth?</em></strong></p>\n<div fbs-brightcove-perform=\"4728591536001\" sz=\"620x350\" key_value_string=\"\" autoplay=\"false\" player-id=\"NJOvFZMYl\" select-rendition=\"max\"></div>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_3","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Media & Entertainment","url":"/media-entertainment"},{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology"},{"id":"channel_7","channelName":"Lifestyle","url":"/lifestyle"},{"id":"channel_7section_94","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"/arts-entertainment"},{"id":"channel_7section_95","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Sports & Leisure","url":"/sports-leisure"}],"pTagCount":30,"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1315068","name":"John Archer","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7df78311ee3b40fa4df55e327aacf25?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7df78311ee3b40fa4df55e327aacf25?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7df78311ee3b40fa4df55e327aacf25?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7df78311ee3b40fa4df55e327aacf25?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/johnarcher/","twitterName":"bigjohnnyarcher","authorType":"individual","email":"jarcherfreelance@btinternet.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about TVs, projectors and other home entertainment technology.","timestamp":1455410426026,"description":"I've spent the past 20 years writing about the world of home entertainment technology--first at Home Cinema Choice magazine, where I became Deputy Editor, and for the past 17 years on a freelance basis.
