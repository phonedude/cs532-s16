 life where I'd be home in time to eat dinner with my kid most nights.

 have never seen him without has faded from deep brown to silver. The 
puns he tormented my younger brother and me with throughout our 
childhood have evolved, improbably, into the funniest jokes my 
6-year-old son has ever heard. I love my dad fiercely, even though he's 
beaten me in every argument we've ever had except two, and even though 
he is, statistically and generationally speaking, a parasite.</p>

<p>This is the charge I've leveled against him on a summer day in our 
Pacific Northwest vision of paradise. I have asked my favorite attorney 
to represent a very troublesome client, the entire baby-boom generation,
 in what should be a slam-dunk trial--for me. On behalf of future 
generations, I am accusing him and all the other parasites his age of 
breaking the sacred bargain that every American generation will pass a 
better country on to its children than the one it inherited.</p>

<p>We are sitting on a beach in late afternoon on a sun-drizzled lake in
 the Cascade Mountains, two college-educated, upper-middle-class white 
men settling in for a week of generational warfare. My son, Max, 
splashes in the waves with his grandmother; sunbathers lounge in inner 
tubes around us; snow-capped peaks loom above the tree line. The breeze 
smells of Coppertone and wet dog. My father thinks back on the country 
that awaited him when he finished law school. "There seemed to be a lot 
of potential," he says, setting up the first of many evasions, "but 
there weren't a lot of jobs."</p>
<p>I'm mildly impressed that he's even bothering to mount a defense. The
 facts as I see them are clear and damning: Baby boomers took the 
economic equivalent of a king salmon from their parents and, before they
 passed it on, gobbled up everything but the bones.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 25px;" src="http://cdn-media.nationaljournal.com/?controllerName=image&amp;action=get&amp;id=22565&amp;width=314" alt="Infographic"></p>
<p>Ultimately, members of my father's generation--generally defined as 
those born between 1946 and 1964--are reaping more than they sowed. They 
graduated smack into one of the strongest economic expansions in 
American history. They needed less education to snag a decent-salaried 
job than their children do, and a college education cost them a small 
fraction of what it did for their children or will for their grandkids. 
One income was sufficient to get a family ahead economically. Marginal 
federal income-tax rates have fallen steadily, with rare exception, 
since boomers entered the labor force; government retirement benefits 
have proliferated. At nearly every point in their lives, these Americans
 chose to slough the costs of those tax cuts and spending hikes onto 
future generations.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose twelvefold from the time the 
first boomers began working until last year, when they began to cash out
 their retirement. (The growth trend over the 12 years since I entered 
the workforce suggests that the Dow will double exactly once before I 
retire.) They will leave the workforce far wealthier than their parents 
did, with even more government promises awaiting them. Boomers will be 
the first generation of retirees to fully enjoy the Medicare 
prescription-drug benefit; because Social Security payouts rise faster 
than price inflation, they will draw more-generous retirement benefits 
than their parents did, in real terms--at their children's expense. The 
Urban Institute estimated last year that a couple retiring in 2011, 
having both earned average wages, will accrue about $200,000 more in 
Medicare and Social Security benefits over their lifetimes than they 
paid in taxes to support those programs.</p>

<p>Those retirees and near-retirees bequeath a shambles to their 
offspring. Young people are unemployed at historically high levels. 
Global competition is stronger than ever, but American institutions have
 not adapted to prepare new workers for its challenges. Boomers have run
 up incomes for the very wealthiest Americans, shrunk the middle class, 
and, via careless borrowing and reckless financial engineering, driven 
the economy into the worst recession in 80 years. The Pew Research 
Center reports that middle-class families today are 5 percent <em>less</em>
 wealthy than their parents were at the same point in their lives, after
 adjusting for inflation, even though families today are far more likely
 to include two wage earners. Another Pew report shows that those ages 
55 to 64 are 10 percent wealthier today, even after the Great Recession,
 than Americans of that age bracket were in 1984. Those younger than 35 
are 68 percent less wealthy than the same bracket was in 1984.</p>
                                <p><img style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 25px;" src="http://cdn-media.nationaljournal.com/?controllerName=image&amp;action=get&amp;id=22562&amp;width=314" alt="Infographic"></p>
<p>The baby boomers built an economy where young people increasingly 
need a college education to move into the middle class, or even to 
simply hold on to the middle-class lifestyle they were born into. But 
the boomers who run state legislatures and private universities have 
collectively pushed the costs of that now-requisite education into the 
stratosphere. Tuition has risen at twice the rate of inflation: In 
today's dollars, tuition, room, and board at a four-year public college 
ran nearly $6,800 per year in 1967; it costs about $13,300 today. 
Private-college tabs have more than doubled in that time. The increase 
has saddled young workers with more than $1 trillion in student debt--the
 average college student today borrows six times more from the federal 
government to finance her education, per year, than the average student 
in 1970. The boomers keep their low taxes, and their alma maters gain 
prestige, but the next generation of workers starts with a debt boulder 
strapped to its back. All for no apparent gain. Today, Pew says, men who
 grew up in the middle class are just as likely to earn less than their 
fathers did (adjusting for inflation) as they are to earn more.</p>
<p>Members of my father's generation reaped the benefits of dirt-cheap 
fossil fuels through most of their working lives, when gasoline price 
increases ran well below inflation, freeing up cash for them to save or 
spend on things their children now cannot afford. Because gas was so 
cheap, they burned too much of it (my father has never owned a car that 
averaged better than 20 miles per gallon), filling the atmosphere with 
carbon dioxide to levels that scientists warn will likely warm the globe
 by several degrees. Climate change will cost trillions of dollars to 
avert or adapt to. It's almost impossible to overstate this level of 
buck-passing.</p>
<p>Perhaps most egregiously, the baby boomers, led by boomer-coddling 
leaders in Washington, are bequeathing a runaway national debt and a 
gaping federal budget shortfall that their children and grandchildren 
will have to pay--through higher taxes or reduced benefits, or both--if 
they don't want the country to go broke. Balancing America's future 
receipts and obligations would require all taxes to rise by 35 percent 
"immediately and permanently," and all federal entitlement benefits to 
decrease by another 35 percent, the International Monetary Fund 
estimated last year. Shielding boomers from that pain--as most so-called 
deficit hawks in Washington propose--would dramatically increase the bill
 for everyone else. Brigham Young University economists Richard Evans 
and Kerk Phillips and Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff 
published a paper in January that projected a 1-in-3 chance that the 
U.S. economy will reach "game over" within 30 years. In their 
definition, "game over" means that the government's obligations to 
seniors (thanks again, boomers) will exceed 100 percent of <em>everyone</em> <em>else's</em>
 earnings. In other words, all the young workers in America together 
won't earn enough to pay down the government's obligations to their 
parents.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to see how the gray-mustachioed attorney is going to get his client out of this one.</p>
<p>That's my first mistake.</p>

<p><b>PARRY, RIPOSTE</b><br></p><p>Beginning in junior high, my father knew he wanted to be a lawyer. He
 grew up an Air Force brat whose father designed cameras for spy planes,
 and he landed in Los Angeles for high school. He met my mother at a 
YMCA dance, kept his nose in his books while his University of <span class="njPopup state"><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/features/restoration-calls/my-father-the-parasite-20121004#" data-omni-click="r'article',r'link',r'6',r'263291'">California</a></span>
 (Santa Barbara) classmates bombed a bank to protest the Vietnam War, 
and graduated near the top of his law-school class at the University of California (Los Angeles). Big firms in California and <span class="njPopup state"><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/features/restoration-calls/my-father-the-parasite-20121004#" data-omni-click="r'article',r'link',r'7',r'263291'">Colorado</a></span> recruited him, but he opted for a clerkship at the Oregon
 Supreme Court and then a two-man firm in a former timber town of 10,000
 residents called McMinnville. There, my dad knew, he could balance work
 with time for coaching Little League and leading the church vestry.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager working summers at McMinnville's semiweekly 
newspaper, I'd often start one morning a week at a downtown coffee shop,
 listening to a pair of old-timers give my dad all kinds of crap. They 
ribbed him about politics, fishing technique, and proper deference to 
the altar guild. They always made him buy their lattes. And when the 
hour was up, they'd shoo him back to the law office with an admonition 
to keep working so he could pay for their Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>You could call this anecdote Exhibit A in my father's defense of the 
boomers, which he offered over coffee on the first day of our weeklong 
dispute. It boils down to a claim that he didn't exactly inherit a great
 deal, either. Tom Tankersley's argument breaks into two categories. 
First, he deflects blame for all of the bad stuff of the past several 
decades to previous generations and myopic politicians. Second, he 
builds a case that the boomers did far more good than harm.</p>
                                <p><img style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 25px;" src="http://cdn-media.nationaljournal.com/?controllerName=image&amp;action=get&amp;id=22564&amp;width=314" alt="Infographic"></p>
<p>The Greatest Generation, his parents' cohort, paid a lot less into 
Social Security and Medicare than it took out of it, he says. (This is 
true.) It did nothing to reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, 
or halt the nation's growing and dangerous addiction to fossil fuels. 
"Previous generations did not have a Clean Air Act or a Clean Water 
Act," he says. His enacted both. (Also true.)</p>
<p>Point, parasite.</p>
<p>After dinner at my parents' cabin near Crescent Lake, my father, 
sporting a blue shirt with a tropical print, spends two hours setting up
 targets and knocking them down with the precision of his favorite 
target rifle. Lawmakers at some point stopped working together to solve 
problems, he says. Big companies gorged on profits and stopped caring 
for their workers' livelihoods. Regular people around the country spent 
money they didn't have, signed mortgages they couldn't afford, and lost 
their patience for delayed gratification. Who's to blame for the 
cultural decay of personal responsibility? "I don't know which 
generation's fault that is," my father says.</p>
<p>He says he's rather surprised that he's still in line to draw 
Medicare and Social Security benefits. "I felt I was paying all this 
money in, and it was going to be gone ... and it turns out I'm going to 
get some." He complains that "no one" is willing to pay the necessary 
taxes for government services or to adjust those services to current tax
 levels. He manages to dismiss one of the greatest acts of fiscal 
recklessness ever by a boomer--President George W. Bush's decision to run
 two wars off the books without raising taxes or cutting outlays to fund
 them--as "outrageous" and "not my choice."</p>
<p>Then he dives for my legs: There's no guarantee that young Max 
Tankersley won't grow up to enjoy economic opportunities as sweeping as 
those his grandparents did. Economic conditions change in unpredictable 
ways, my dad says. Oh, and the idea that opportunity eroded for my 
generation? Only if you're a white American man. In his lifetime, he 
points out, women and minorities have seen their economic prospects 
brighten considerably, especially in higher-earning fields like the law.
 (A quartet of economists from Stanford and the University of Chicago 
reported this spring, "In 1960, 94 percent of doctors were white men, as
 were 96 percent of lawyers and 86 percent of managers. By 2008, these 
numbers had fallen to 63, 61, and 57 percent, respectively.")  Expanded 
trade has helped to lift people in Africa, Brazil, China, and the rest 
of the developing world out of poverty. (The World Bank reported this 
year that 22 percent of the developing world's population lives on $1.25
 or less per day, down from 52 percent in 1981.) My father says he will 
not apologize for that.</p>
<p>I keep bringing him back to the critique: His generation bought homes
 in a far cheaper market than mine; they didn't move us off oil; they've
 reaped the stock gains and the carbon externalities and the budget 
deficits--and left us with the bill. He keeps brushing me off, flipping 
the camera. "There's this whole theory in democracy that you get the 
government you deserve," he says, readying more verbal jujitsu. "And 
it's our fault for not saying, 'That's enough,' just like it's your 
fault. I mean, you've been voting now for how long?"</p>
<p>By evening's end, the defense has turned to open taunting. So what, 
he asks, if it's his generation's fault? "What are you going to do with 
that? Are you going to learn something and not do it? Or are you going 
to just point fingers, like this article seems to be doing?"</p>
<p>I realize: He's beating me.</p>

<p><b>ROUND TWO</b><br></p><p>The day after my trouncing, we retreat farther into the mountains, to
 a chilly lake where the Deschutes River springs to life, for a night of
 camping with family friends. We swim and roast marshmallows and play in
 the dirt and watch deer walk past the tent. Max helps my parents paddle
 the canoe.</p>
<p>In the morning, we comb the campsite, picking up food wrappers and 
specs of trash, some of them months old. You always leave your site 
cleaner than you found it, I tell Max, because other people will come 
after you, and others after them. It's your duty as a camper.</p>
<p>Where did you learn that? he asks.</p>
<p>Your grandpa, I say.</p>
<p>This is the moment the prosecution regains its footing, by 
remembering just how hypocritical the defense has been. Boomers have 
always talked about making the world a better place. They were the 
century's most idealistic young people. They've also known for decades 
about the fiscal, economic, and environmental paths America was headed 
down. How can they possibly square that wisdom with their inaction?</p>
<p>We break camp. Back at the cabin, I call up statistics, build 
economic charts online, and transplant a new backbone into my case. (I'd
 chide my dad here for installing Wi-Fi at his cabin, but I think it was
 Mom's idea.)</p>
                                <p>In my mind, I know which of his 
arguments I must grant. The boomers haven't been a total disaster, of 
course. They did indeed blaze huge social and economic trails for women,
 minorities, and people with disabilities. Those groups have gained 
rights that, as long as the rest of us remain vigilant, will never be 
reversed: Young women can grow up to be lawyers or scientists. 
African-Americans can grow up to be president. Boomers gave us Apple and
 Microsoft. They made the <em>Star</em> <em>Wars</em> movies. They grew the economy for a bit. Once, for a couple of years in the late 1990s, they balanced the federal budget.</p>
<p>But the numbers on the laptop remind me how fleeting much of that 
progress was--and how boomers chose short-term gratification when they 
had opportunities to secure a better future for generations to follow. 
Classic example: Instead of devoting the budget surpluses of the late 
'90s to social programs that desperately needed them, they voted 
themselves tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, and an expanded Medicare benefit 
shortly after--a move a Congressional Budget Office study from that era 
suggests raised the expected tax rate on future generations from 29 
percent to 53 percent. They borrowed heavily to cope with the economic 
sluggishness of the 2000s and, in so doing, inflated a housing bubble 
that, when it popped, triggered the Great Recession.</p>

<p>Median-income growth has stagnated for women and minorities over the 
past decade. The typical African-American today has less wealth than his
 or her parents did, according to Pew. Labor-force participation for 
women this year hit its lowest level since 1991.</p>
<p>And Congress? Well, Capitol Hill is where I realize I'll win this 
trial. Baby boomers chose the leaders currently paralyzing Washington, 
and those leaders are, by and large, boomers. My father's cohort has 
formed a generational majority in every Congress since the dawn of the 
George W. Bush administration. Electorally, boomers vote in dramatically
 larger numbers than anyone else. The Census Bureau reports there were 
81 million Americans ages 45 to 64 in 2010, of whom slightly more than 
half voted. They made up about 43 percent of the electorate--almost as 
much as those 25 to 44 and those 65 and older <em>combined</em>.</p>
<p>As afternoon descends over the fir trees, I call my father over and 
show him this statistic. Look, I say. That government you say is 
crippling America? You and your friends own it.</p>
<p>"Shit," he says.</p>

<p><b>BITTERSWEET VICTORY</b><br></p><p>The first time I bested my dad in an argument, I was in fourth grade.
 I wanted to play football, and he said it was too dangerous. With my 
mother's help, I trekked to the public library and pulled up some 
research showing that youth football was perfectly safe (oops!) and even
 built character. I may also have threatened to run away. My dad 
relented. My football career was short and forgettable, but I'd beaten 
him with data.</p>
<p>My second win came when I was in eighth grade and wanted to drive 
eight hours with a bunch of college students and coaches to see my 
favorite basketball team in a playoff game. My dad said, "No, you are 
not driving to <span class="njPopup state"><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/features/restoration-calls/my-father-the-parasite-20121004#" data-omni-click="r'article',r'link',r'8',r'263291'">Idaho</a></span>
 with a bunch of college kids." To which I replied, tears in my eyes, 
"Well, what if you came with me?" It was blatant emotional manipulation.
 We ended up watching the Linfield Wildcats lose, in person, together.</p>
<p>I connect these two strategies in my closing argument against the 
boomers. I win my conviction against my father on his fishing boat on a 
choppy Friday, lines bobbing wildly in the swells, the trolling motor 
struggling to hold speed against a bracing wind. The boy and the grandma
 are back on shore. It is only us, a photographer, and a Labrador 
retriever. I am at the wheel, my dad is working the rods.</p>
<p>I start with data. The deal the baby boomers got from the Greatest 
Generation wasn't so raw, economically: Gross domestic product growth 
from 1970 to 2000 was among the strongest in American history, and far 
better than the average growth so far in the working years of 
Generations X and Y.</p>
<p>The Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act have improved the 
environment, but the federal government has done almost nothing to curb 
the growth in carbon emissions here or around the world. Earth's 
atmosphere is currently 391 parts per million carbon dioxide, up from 
about 325 ppm 40 years ago. The concentration is  on pace to hit 450 ppm
 by 2035, which would translate into an increase in global average 
temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius, the tipping point at which scientists
 say we would no longer be able to block or reverse a future of the most
 catastrophic impacts of climate change. More high-temperature records 
were set across the U.S. last year than in any previous one. Arctic ice 
melted to an all-time recorded low.</p>
<p>America's federal debt-to-GDP ratio has more than doubled from 28 
percent to 62 percent since 1970, and the borrowing has benefited 
boomers far more than folks my age. A majority of boomers want no part 
of paying that debt off through higher taxes or reduced benefits: A 
recent Pew poll found "little appetite [among that age group] for 
debt-reduction proposals that will take a bite out of their 
pocketbooks."</p>
                                <p>And boomers seem to know that the 
future won't be brighter for Max and his friends. Nationwide, optimism 
that today's youth will fare better than their parents is down from a 
peak of 71 percent a decade ago to 44 percent today, the lowest level 
since 1983, according to Gallup. Pessimism is highest among--you guessed 
it--baby boomers.</p>
<p>My emotional argument seals the case. Where I finally best my dad is 
on the question of why his cohort hasn't stopped the freight trains of 
generational woe that have been barreling down America's tracks for a 
few decades now. The question he can't answer is this: How could the 
members of a generation so willing to lecture everyone else on personal 
responsibility not recognize, even at this stage in their lives, their 
collective responsibility for ending this mess?</p>
<p>You used to be such an idealistic generation, I say. You were going 
to change the world. Yet you've known all this was coming and haven't 
tried seriously to stop it. You've reaped all the benefits and left the 
rest of us the bill. And you knew what you were doing. Why?</p>
<p>He hooks and nets a fish. When he has rebaited the line, he vents 
some frustration at his boomer peers/clients. "I'm saying, there are 
problems," he says, "and I've been talking about them for a long time."</p>
<p>He stops pushing back and starts making concessions. On the budget, 
he says, "You're right, we haven't had the, whatever, to say to our 
parents' generation, 'No, we're not going to give you those Social 
Security raises,' " even when, as in recent years, low inflation levels 
haven't warranted them.</p>
<p>Those raises represent a tiny fraction of our future debt load (the 
lethal combination of soaring Medicare costs and insufficient tax 
revenue accounts for most of it), but, hey, I'll take what I can get. 
Life isn't <em>Perry</em> <em>Mason</em>; the defendant never confesses 
on the stand. The closest my father comes, in this case, is with energy 
policy and carbon pollution. "I'm disappointed in the environmental 
thing," he says. "We could have done a lot more."</p>
<p>Our budget and economy are struggling through a huge transition, he 
says. "But if the country says we've got this big challenge, and we're 
going to share it in a fair way, then Max will be fine." I wonder aloud,
 what are the odds that will happen? He grimaces under the mustache. 
"Your generation, my generation, everybody," he says. "If someone says 
you can have something for free, you tend to want to have it." He asks 
me to swing the motor, and we steer back toward the dock, into a 
gathering mass of black clouds.</p>

<p><b>LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON</b><br></p><p>Only later do I notice the knife he's left in my side. We are sitting
 at the kitchen table. He is joking about regrets ("You raise these 
kids, and then they turn on you!") when he suddenly becomes serious and 
offers me a rare piece of fatherly advice. "We didn't stop it. Maybe 
someday, Max can have the same discussion with you and ask you why you 
didn't stop it. He'll get the article out. He'll say, 'You knew about 
it! You knew about it even more than [your parents] did!' "</p>
<p>The knife twists. I am 34 years old. I have some pretty successful 
friends. How have we sacrificed to balance the budget, to slow climate 
change, to deliver better opportunity for our children? We haven't. I 
own an SUV, and I don't compost my trash. We are barreling, 
generationally, toward higher and higher levels of carbon emissions; a 
demographer from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research 
estimated last year that an individual's emissions rise some 50 percent 
from the time he is in his 30s until the time he retires. Worst of all, 
we don't seem to care about changing things: Only about a third of 
registered 25-to-44-year-olds voted in the 2010 election, compared with 
half of registered baby boomers.</p>
<p>If my father is a leech on the future, then I am becoming one, too.</p>
<p>"Your generation should be thinking about how you'll step up to the 
plate," my dad says, brown eyes boring into mine. "And you also need to 
step up to the plate, learning from us about the politics. Just say no 
to the kind of politics that get in the way of what you perceive are the
 solution."</p>
<p>He rises to water the saplings behind the cabin ("for the next 
generation"), and leaves me to stare out through the tall firs. My 
little boy has come in from playing in the dirt.</p>
<p>"Daddy," he yells.</p>
<p>Parasite, I hear.</p></div></section>

        <p class="dek">The passing of Antonin Scalia roils the presidential campaign and could leave the Supreme Court deadlocked until 2017. Will the Senate even consider a replacement nominated by President Obama?</p>
        
        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>The sudden death of Antonin Scalia, an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, on Saturday morning will shake up American politics like few events in recent memory, reshaping the 2016 presidential campaign and potentially leaving the Supreme Court deadlocked for more than a year.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the short term, President Obama will have to decide who to nominate to replace the voluble conservative jurist, and the Republican-led Senate will have to decide whether to even consider the president&#x2019;s pick in the heat of the election campaign. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately signaled that an Obama nominee would not get a vote this year. &#x201C;The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,&#x201D; the Kentucky Republican said in a statement. &#x201C;Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.&#x201D; CNN reported Saturday evening that Obama intends to nominate a new Supreme Court justice, setting up a potential confrontation with Republicans that would play out both on &#xA0;Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail.</p>&#13;

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p class="dropcap">O<span class="smallcaps">n a sultry evening</span> last July, a tall, soft-spoken 17-year-old named David Stoner and nearly 600 other math whizzes from all over the world sat huddled in small groups around wicker bistro tables, talking in low voices and obsessively refreshing the browsers on their laptops. The air in the cavernous lobby of the Lotus Hotel Pang Suan Kaew in Chiang Mai, Thailand, was humid, recalls Stoner, whose light South Carolina accent warms his carefully chosen words. The tension in the room made it seem especially heavy, like the atmosphere at a high-stakes poker tournament.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Stoner and five teammates were representing the United States in the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad. They figured they&#x2019;d done <i>pretty</i> well over the two days of competition. God knows, they&#x2019;d trained hard. Stoner, like his teammates, had endured a grueling regime for more than a year&#x2014;practicing tricky problems over breakfast before school and taking on more problems late into the evening after he completed the homework for his college-level math classes. Sometimes, he sketched out proofs on the large dry-erase board his dad had installed in his bedroom. Most nights, he put himself to sleep reading books like <i>New Problems in Euclidean Geometry</i> and <i>An Introduction to Diophantine Equations</i>.</p>&#13;

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p><span class="smallcaps">March was a </span>hugely important month for religion and the Supreme Court, and a pivotal moment for Justice Antonin Scalia, the subject of a fat new biography. Too bad we couldn&#x2019;t talk plainly about what was, and is, at stake. In a country historically averse to political debates about competing faiths, nowhere is frank discussion of religion more taboo than at the U.S. Supreme Court. &#x201C;Religion is the third rail of Supreme Court politics. It&#x2019;s not something that&#x2019;s talked about in polite company,&#x201D; as Jeff Shesol, the author of a book about the New Deal Court, put it. He was speaking with NPR&#x2019;s Nina Totenberg in 2010, when John Paul Stevens was looking at retirement and, for the first time in American history, there was the prospect of six Catholics, three Jews, and no Protestants on the highest court in the land&#x2014;a watershed almost too &#x201C;radioactive,&#x201D; Totenberg remarked, even to note. And beware of venturing any further than that, as the University of Chicago Law School&#x2019;s Geoffrey Stone did in a controversial 2007 blog post suggesting that the Supreme Court&#x2019;s five conservatives likely derived their abortion views from Catholic doctrine: Scalia&#x2014;a devout Catholic, and the current Court&#x2019;s longest-serving conservative&#x2014;announced a boycott of the school until Stone leaves the faculty.</p>&#13;

<p>First, Facebook&#x2019;s Free Basics platform was <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/net-neutrality-is-interesting-no-really/461943/">effectively banned</a> in India. Then, a high-profile member of Facebook&#x2019;s board of directors, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, sounded off about the decision to his nearly half-a-million Twitter followers with a stunning comment.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#x201C;Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades,&#x201D; Andreessen wrote. &#x201C;Why stop now?&#x201D;</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After that, the Internet went nuts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Andreessen deleted his tweet, apologized, and underscored that he is &#x201C;100 percent opposed to colonialism&#x201D; and &#x201C;100 percent in favor of independence and freedom.&#x201D; Zuckerberg, Facebook&#x2019;s CEO, followed up with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102645335962321">his own Facebook post</a> to say Andreessen&#x2019;s comment was &#x201C;deeply upsetting&#x201D; to him, and not representative of the way he thinks &#x201C;at all.&#x201D;</p>&#13;

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>After decades of anticipation, we have directly detected gravitational waves&#x2014;ripples in spacetime traveling at the speed of light through the universe. Scientists at <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a> (the Laser Interferometic Gravitational-wave Observatory) have announced that they have measured waves coming from the inspiral of two massive black holes, providing a spectacular confirmation of Albert Einstein&#x2019;s general theory of relativity, whose hundredth anniversary was celebrated just last year.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finding gravitational waves indicates that Einstein was (once again) right, and opens a new window onto energetic events occurring around the universe. But there&#x2019;s a deeper lesson, as well: a reminder of the central importance of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality">locality</a></em>, an idea that underlies much of modern physics.</p>&#13;

That&#x2019;s how it feels to watch Ben Stiller&#x2019;s sequel to his 2001 spoof of the fashion industry: <em>Zoolander 2</em> takes pains to reference every successful gag you remember from the original, and then embellish them in painful&#x2014;often offensive, almost always outdated&#x2014;fashion. It&#x2019;s a film that has no real reason to exist, and it spends its entire running time reaffirming that fact.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<!-- END "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p>The original <em>Zoolander</em>, to be fair, had no business being as funny as it was&#x2014;it made fun of an industry that already seems to exist in a constant state of self-parody, and much of its humor relied on simple malapropisms and sight gags. But it was hilarious anyway as a candid snapshot of the fizzling-out of &#x2019;90s culture. Like almost any zeitgeist comedy, it belonged to a particular moment&#x2014;and boy, should it have stayed there. With <em>Zoolander 2</em>, Stiller (who directed, co-wrote, and stars) tries to recapture the magic of 2001 by referencing its past glories with increasing desperation, perhaps to avoid the fact that he has nothing new to say about the fashion industry or celebrity culture 15 years laters.</p>&#13;

<p><span>Many people in this world would find my behavior rather strange. That&#x2019;s because Americans are exceptionally promiscuous when it comes to professing their love.
