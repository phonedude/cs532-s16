<p>A collegiate runner for the University of Minnesota, Katie began to dabble in half marathons after her eligibility ended. Like most runners, she found the need for a new goal. She ran a 2:52 and won her debut, the 2009 Fox Cities Marathon. With this strong showing, Katie knew with a little more marathoning experience, an Olympic Trials Qualifier was within her grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;After my first marathon my then-boyfriend clued me in that I could even qualify for the marathon trials and what the standard was. It certainly became my mission after that point!&#8221; Katie said. It took a few tries, she even thought it wasn&#8217;t meant to be at one point, but eventually Katie did just that; she qualified for the 2016 Marathon Trials on the last day of the two-and-a-half-year qualifying window and did it with her husband Christopher by her side. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/02/11/otq-katie/#more-47303'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

Picture that, and then imagine you&#8217;re toeing the line with Kara Goucher, Shalane Flanagan, Desi Linden and nearly 200 of the other current fastest women distance runners in the US, all vying for a spot on the US Olympic Team. For sports psychologist-in-training Stephanie Dinius, this isn&#8217;t just an exercise in visualization; this will be her reality as she lines up to run the Olympic Trials Marathon this Saturday.</p>
<p>I met Stephanie in Jacksonville. She&#8217;s so friendly and warm, and positivity oozes out of her every pore! As I stood at the finish line waiting for the women to round the track to the finish at the Jax Half, I heard the tell-tale cheers, looked over and who was leading the charge? Stephanie! STEPHANIE!</p>
<p>She looked strong, fluid, and joyful as she edged Esther Atkins to the line. Once finished, she, Esther and the third-place finisher, Laurie Knowles congratulated the newly qualified Keely Maguire. Their exuberance, especially Stephanie&#8217;s, was palpable!</p>
<p>As with every Olympic Trials athlete we&#8217;ve profiled so far, Stephanie is so much more than a fast runner and a nice person. Trust me; after reading her story, you&#8217;ll have one more amazing woman to cheer for on Saturday <span style="line-height: 1.5;">as you witness marathoning rising-star Stephanie Dinius take on 26.2 for the first time!</span> <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/02/10/who-to-watch-at-the-trials-stephanie-dinius/#more-47450'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>Giving birth to four kids in seven years is no easy feat. But having four kids in seven years while marathon training, and <em>then</em> actually qualifying for the Olympic Marathon Trials in your first marathon? Simply amazing! That&#8217;s Ellie Hess, the former DIII All-American who excelled in the 5k and steeplechase in college. Ellie currently trains and races as a member of <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/01/06/cleveland-elite-development/" target="_blank">Cleveland Elite Development</a> and somehow finds the time and<em> </em>energy for motherhood and elite-level running.</p>
<p>Ellie wasn&#8217;t always a star runner. She began jogging in high school to stay in shape for other sports and quickly found her jogs helped her blow off steam. While she could accomplish about an 8-minute-mile naturally, it wasn&#8217;t until she dedicated her athletic energy to running that she realized her full potential. She stuck to her other sports through high school, but joined the cross-country team at John Carroll University under peer pressure.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of competing against Ellie in college or, more precisely, getting beat by Ellie in college, and I wanted to learn how she manages to train and compete at such a high level with the many demands of her busy life.  <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/02/09/who-to-watch-at-the-olympic-trials-ellie-hess/#more-47299'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>The <a href="http://www.latrials2016.com/" target="_blank">2016 US Olympic Marathon Trials</a> are this weekend, Saturday to be exact, and we here at Salty Running have been giving you <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/olympic-trials/" target="_blank">the inside scoop</a> on many of the athletes running. You may have plans to watch from the comfort of your home but if you happen to be in Los Angeles on February 13th, you might want to pop on by. Did you know it is<em><strong> free</strong></em> to come out and watch this premier event?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Unlike the Super Bowl, the World Series, or heck, even the Olympic Track and Field Trials, the Marathon Trials do not charge admission. Score! In 2012, James and I made a last-minute decision to travel to Houston, TX to watch the Trials and it turned out to be an awesome experience. In doing so, I learned a few quick tips for spectating. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/02/09/spectators-guide-to-the-olympic-trials-marathon/#more-46942'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">If you watched the 2012 Olympic Marathon Trials, you might have noticed a woman at the back of the pack having the time of her life, smiling and waving to the crowds of spectators lining the streets of Houston. While the cameras were fixed on Shalane, Desi, Kara, and Amy, some of the women who qualified for the Trials months or even years before the event, did not line up ready to run the race of their lives. Such was the case with Ruth Perkins.</p>
<p class="p1">After qualifying for her first Olympic Trials in the fall of 2010, Ruth ramped up her training only to arrive in Houston with a sacral stress fracture. With the blessing of her orthopedist, she planned to run a few miles of the Trials; when else might she get the chance? But when she got out there, she had so much fun that the few miles turned into 18 in the 6:40s, with Ruth dropping out of the race just as Kara Goucher blew by on her way to earning a spot on the 2010 U.S. Olympic Team. Miraculously, Ruth&#8217;s pelvis held up too.</p>
<p class="p1">Salty and I had the pleasure of chatting with Ruth in Jacksonville. She immediately charmed us with her coke bottle glasses, perky mannerisms and <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/08/45899/">wacky sense of humor</a>, and we know you&#8217;ll love her too! <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/02/08/ruth-perkins/#more-47192'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>It was a rare moment during our<a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/06/why-did-we-go-to-jacksonville/" target="_blank"> trip to Jacksonville</a> that I found myself relaxed and chatting about kids with two other moms. All three of us have five year olds so we were sharing funny anecdotes and commiserating as moms do. We could have been at the grocery store, swimming lessons, or a piano recital. But we weren&#8217;t. One of those moms was less than 24 hours away from <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/04/45704/" target="_blank">nailing an Olympic Trials Qualifier</a> in her first attempt. One of those moms is Keely Maguire.</p>
<p>It was only five months earlier, in August of 2015, after struggling with a seemingly endless string of injuries after graduating from college, Keely contemplated giving up the sport of running. With some cajoling from her college coach, Robert Hoppler who never stopped believing in her, Keely decided she&#8217;d give it one last shot: qualify for the Olympic Marathon Trials in a half in January or BUST!</p>
<p>So with the support of her coach and her family, she traveled to Jacksonville to give it a shot.<br />

After a great marathoning career that featured an Olympic Trials &#8220;A&#8221; Standard, a place on the U.S. Pan American Games team, among many other highlights, Brett is stepping back from competitive marathoning after the Trials on February 13, 2016.</p>
<p>Brett is, thankfully, going into this race healthy after a strong training season and, knowing it will be her last competitive marathon, is putting <em>everything</em> into this one. At 36, Brett has a mental fortitude forged from years of striving for more, getting knocked down, and then getting right back up. Her jitters at the starting line will be tempered by that maturity and experience.</p>
<p>Perhaps what&#8217;s most impressive about Brett is that she&#8217;s one of those women who manages to achieve so much as an athlete while also achieving so much in her life outside of running <em>and</em> is still one of those women who you can&#8217;t help but want to grab a beer with and chat about this and that. If you&#8217;re like me, after learning more about her, you&#8217;ll be dying to cheer for her in LA as she goes for it. One. More. Time.</p>

When Salty and I had lunch with her in Jacksonville, the talk was babies and strollers, nap time and preschool prep. If you met her at the grocery store, you would have no idea about the other lives she&#8217;s had.</p>
<p>Then again, if you met her at the grocery store near her house outside of Washington, D.C., you&#8217;d probably see her in spandex with her two daughters in a double wide running stroller, so you might get a glimpse. Even then though, you probably wouldn&#8217;t guess that Emily is the kind of woman who can casually, <em>just happen to,</em> qualify for the Olympic Trials Marathon while on a family vacation, just 10 months after having her second child.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s because you wouldn&#8217;t know her as Major Emily Potter of the United States Army&#8217;s World Class Athlete Program. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/28/emily-potter/#more-46631'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

She&#8217;s a little more pensive than many of the women. A little more &#8230; something. Not insular, because she&#8217;s very friendly. Not introverted, because there are lots of elites who are introverted. Not intelligent, because a lot of elites are that too. There&#8217;s something about her that you can&#8217;t quite put your finger on, and it&#8217;s immediately intriguing.</p>
<p>Learning that she is a Ph.D. in neuroscience and an accomplished writer in the field helps to fill in some of the blanks; Teal is <em>smart</em> and it shows in the way she speaks. She&#8217;s thoughtful and careful with her words. For Teal, convention isn&#8217;t running with a team and it certainly isn&#8217;t media attention. In fact she can at times seem a little surprised to be where she is. In fact, by most standards she didn&#8217;t start out as anything special or even close to elite-status; her first marathon time was 4:07. But Teal&#8217;s own standards for herself are much, much higher than anyone else&#8217;s, and that has taken her far along the road to the 2016 Olympic Marathon Trials in L.A. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/20/watch-olympic-trials-teal-burrell/#more-46521'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>Late last week the <a href="http://www.letsrun.com" target="_blank">Letsrun</a> boards were abuzz with a thread simply titled, &#8220;<a href="http://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=6962797" target="_blank">This Chick Refers To Herself As Elite??</a>&#8221; It piqued my interest because it resurrected the age-old question of what defines elite, featured the usual troll chatter, and even had the chick&#8217;s husband cracking jokes on <a href="http://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=6962797&amp;page=3" target="_blank">page 4</a>. The chick in question is 25 year-old newlywed Emma Polley (née Kertesz), the University of Toledo phenom and former member of the Hansons-Brooks ODP.</p>
<p>After checking out <a href="https://emzmiles.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Emma&#8217;s blog</a>, we were convinced that Emma is no ordinary chick. Besides her many running accomplishments like being an NCAA All American, a 4-time <a href="http://mac-sports.com/" target="_blank">MAC Champion</a>, a member of Team USA at the 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chiba_Ekiden" target="_blank">Chiba Ekiden World Relay Competition</a>, and a 2016 Olympic Trials qualifier, Emma is smart, funny, and pretty badass. Naturally, we had to talk to her!</p>
<p>When I emailed her and asked her if she&#8217;d like to talk to us about running, life, and the LetsRun thread about her, she enthusiastically agreed! She was well aware of the shenanigans on LetsRun, calling the thread about her &#8220;quite the cesspool of insensitive comments.&#8221; However, she, like us, is all about women championing other women (think power of the pack) and sticking it to loser internet trolls; something we can all get behind!</p>
<p>So, instead of talking about someone you don&#8217;t know on an anonymous thread, we went straight to the source to get to know this elite-in-many-ways chick. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/18/this-chick-refers-to-herself-as-elite/#more-46303'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

With her big, infectious smile and penchant for goofy socks, Olivia&#8217;s positivity shines through everything she does. Salty and I had the pleasure of chatting with Olivia when we were in Jacksonville and we couldn&#8217;t wait to tell you all about her!</p>
<p>Originally from Sacramento, California, Olivia ran cross country in high school to get into shape for soccer, but soon discovered a hidden talent that took her to Brown as a collegiate runner. &#8220;But I honestly don&#8217;t think I became a runner until junior year of college,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I was injured freshman year, didn&#8217;t really know what I was doing sophomore year, and then that summer going into junior year I ran higher mileage and everyone was like, &#8216;<em>who the heck are you!?&#8217;</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>She says that was the year she fell in love with running and it showed. In 2013 she ran a 33:29 10k, which set a new Brown record and earned a rank of 16th in the NCAA D1. She also had great success in the 5k, with a PR of 16:21.29. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/14/olympic-trials-marathon-bound-olivia-mickle/#more-46087'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>The Olympic Marathon Trials are one month from today! We have lots planned to celebrate the big day, but we&#8217;re kicking it off by introducing you to one of the Trials competitors, an American distance running rising star named Lauren Jimison. At 25, she&#8217;s already a three-time marathoner and has a fantastic coach and club behind her back, and the most positive outlook on life you can imagine.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to meet Lauren back in 2013 when I ran with the elites at the Gate River Run USATF 15k Championship. At the time, she was a recent graduate of Asuza Pacific University working for her alma mater and testing the waters of professional road racing. We kept in touch as she dove into running completely the next year, not only making the transition to full-time professional runner but also racing her first marathon, finishing with a 2:35 Olympic Trials &#8220;A&#8221; qualifier at Grandma&#8217;s Marathon!</p>
<p>As the Olympic Marathon Trials approach, I had the chance to ask Lauren a few questions about her running background, plans for the Trials and more. I hope she inspires you as much as she inspires me and that you&#8217;ll join me in cheering her on in L.A.! <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/13/lauren-jimison-interview-needs-a-catchy-title/#more-45603'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>So we went to Jacksonville and now you know <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/06/why-did-we-go-to-jacksonville/" target="_blank">our reasons</a>, but perhaps you are left wondering why a back or middle of the pack runner would care about Jacksonville. About elite runners. How are these fast women connected to you? Why should you care?</p>
<p>To dispel any myths here: my first race had a mile pace of 15 minutes and my last race had a pace of 7:45. I&#8217;ve been the slowest woman on my team many times, and it&#8217;s pretty rare that I can hang with the fast crowd. I&#8217;m happy with my progress, but really over four years of writing for SR I&#8217;ve gone from solidly average to just a hair above average. As for Jacksonville, a week ago I was essentially in the same boat as most other mid-packers. I&#8217;ll likely never compete with these elite women or at their level, so before this weekend I didn&#8217;t think that I fit into any discussion about them.</p>
<p>I knew Jacksonville would be fun, and was excited to spend time with my sister there, but throughout the experience I wasn&#8217;t quite certain what our role was. Salty tried to explain her ideas to me, but it didn&#8217;t really amount to much out of context. Obviously we had taken on a job, providing media coverage of women at the biggest elite field a small scale half marathon had ever seen, but &#8230; why? Salty Running isn&#8217;t the Gawker of running, or even the New York Times, but something was nonetheless compelling me to do this exhausting work. Something bigger.</p>
<p>Something that affects you.<br />

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-45812" src="http://www.saltyrunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_9232-560x560.jpg" alt="IMG_9232" width="350" height="350" />On Monday night, Esther Atkins published a <a href="https://www.athletebiz.us/blog/why-jacksonville-half-was-so-great/" target="_blank">great article</a> that explained, from the participating athlete&#8217;s perspective, why the Jacksonville Half was such a special race. She highlighted three points: participants came for the love of the sport over personal glory; the benefits to performance of helping or being helped; and the positive buzz surrounding the whole endeavor. Everything that Esther Atkins writes about was what <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/10/22/richard-clark-fannin-sisterhood-and-the-magic-in-jacksonville/" target="_blank">intrigued me about this race from go</a>.</p>
<p>Back in October, when I heard about the plans, I immediately reached out to Richard Fannin, who had never met me, never heard of me, had no idea what I was doing, but asked me to give him a call to talk about it on the spot. While we chatted it was obvious how passionate he was for the sport and how committed he was to pulling his crazy plan off. Maybe because he could tell I shared his passion or probably just because he&#8217;s really nice, within minutes of making my acquaintance I had an invitation to Jacksonville. Having never covered a race, having hardly traveled since having kids, having absolutely no idea what to expect, I jumped. I didn&#8217;t know why at the time; I&#8217;m usually cautious about these things, but my gut made me do it.</p>
<p>Esther does spectacular work explaining why Jacksonville was a special race for those elite and subelite runners who raced there, but maybe you&#8217;re left wondering why <em>you</em> should care about Jacksonville. Heck, you might be wondering why <em>we </em>went to Jacksonville.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t go to Jacksonville to rub elbows with running legends or rising stars. We didn&#8217;t go to promote ourselves. We didn&#8217;t go to provide race play-by-play or to report on stats (we&#8217;ll leave that to Fannin). We didn&#8217;t go as fangirls. We didn&#8217;t go because it was easy for us to get there (it wasn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>Why <em>did</em> we go to Jacksonville? <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2016/01/06/why-did-we-go-to-jacksonville/#more-45793'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<hr />
<p>The plan was even 5:41 splits for 13.1 miles, delivering her pack as close to 1:14:30 as she could. If anyone could do it, it was Brianne Nelson, aka “the human metronome,” a woman reknowned for her even pacing. She’s also one of the few women for whom 5:41 pace is relatively pedestrian.</p>
<p>Brianne is also not someone who runs for glory; for her, it’s all about the pursuit of excellence.  Today it wasn’t even about the pursuit of her own, although getting in a good pre-trials half-marathon effort definitely helps her in that, today she braved chilly temperatures on the rainy streets of Jacksonville to lead others to excellence. Today it was about <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/12/30/salty-running-takes-on-jacksonville/" target="_blank">harnessing the Power of the Pack to help the 21 women</a> who travelled to Jacksonville in hopes of qualifying for the Olympic Marathon Trials.</p>

<p>This weekend, Olympic Trials qualifiers and hopefuls will converge in Jacksonville, Florida for the <a href="http://www.1stplacesports.com/jm.html" target="_blank">JAX Bank Half Marathon</a>. Noted race director and running super fan Richard Clark Fannin hatched up a plan to bring some of the country&#8217;s fastest runners, runners who have already secured their spot at <a href="http://www.latrials2016.com/" target="_blank">February&#8217;s Olympic Trials Marathon</a>, to pace those who have yet to qualify. On January 3, 2016, this crazy idea will come to fruition.</p>
<p>So, remember when <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/12/25/christmas-chicken-and-the-egg/" target="_blank">I told you we had big news</a>? Well, Cinnamon and I are traveling to Florida!</p>
<p>Why, do you ask, is it news that a Clevelander and a New Yorker are hopping on a plane for sunny Florida on January 1st? Because we are going there to cover women&#8217;s running history take place at the JAX Bank Half for you!</p>
<p>When others in sport, even our sport, are solely focused on their own achievements, some of the country&#8217;s best runners, like two-time Olympian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Famiglietti" target="_blank">Anthony Famiglietti</a> for the men and 1:10:16 half marathoner Brianne Nelson for the women, offered to pace other runners to breakthrough performances in Jacksonville, we knew we had to be there. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/12/30/salty-running-takes-on-jacksonville/#more-45486'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>Just a few weeks shy of 44, Joanna Zieger lined up at the 2014 Shamrock Marathon with one goal: qualify for her third Olympic Marathon Trials. She gave that race everything she had, yet missed the mark by a mere 58 seconds. After a long world-class athletic career, including placing fourth in the triathlon at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, some <a href="http://racereadycoaching.com/usa-half-marathon-invitational-race-report/" target="_blank">recent health problems</a> prevented another qualifying attempt. Joanna accepted that her Olympic Trials days were over.</p>
<p>This past October, just 15 months after the birth of her twins, Becki Spellman (who has contributed as <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/author/rocket/" target="_blank">Rocket</a> here) ran a 2:44:44 at the <a class="zem_slink" title="Columbus Marathon" href="http://www.columbusmarathon.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Columbus Marathon</a>. That&#8217;s an incredible performance, but Becki was heartbroken. Despite giving it her all, she came up short.</p>
<p>Sara Polatas, just 22 years-old and running her first marathon, also raced her heart out in Columbus, but missed the 2:43:00 standard by 41 seconds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after a single tweet, all three became 2016 Olympic Trials Qualifiers! <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/12/12/usatf-changes-the-standards/#more-44881'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>Some races have their mythology. like Athens, of course, where <a class="zem_slink" title="Pheidippides" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheidippides" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Pheidippides</a> died upon completing his journey. Then there&#8217;s Boston, which embodies its mythology in its unicorn logo. In the twenty-first century, a new legend is emerging in Sacramento, where the <a class="zem_slink" title="California International Marathon" href="http://www.runcim.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">California International Marathon</a> churns our more breakthroughs than any other marathon.</p>
<p>Sunday&#8217;s CIM didn&#8217;t disappoint, adding 13 new U.S. women Olympic Trials Qualifiers to the nine it produced in 2013 and the 14 from last year. But that doesn&#8217;t begin to tell the whole story.</p>
<p>While 13 trials qualifiers is impressive, if the trials standard was 2:46 as it was for the 2012 trials, 31 women would have qualified last week! A whopping 101 women ran sub-3:00 at this year&#8217;s CIM. In a race with just 5,800 participants, that&#8217;s a lot of excellent racing!</p>
<p>What is it about this race that produces so many stellar performances? <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/12/09/the-magic-marathon-cim-hduhud-and-the-power-of-the-pack/#more-44667'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>On September 21, 2013, two days before she was supposed to run one of the biggest races of her life and where she would attempt to qualify for the Olympic Marathon Trials, Jessica sat beside her husband at the Seidman Cancer Center in Cleveland, Ohio, trying to digest devastating, heart-wrenching news that would ultimately steal away her Tommy.</p>
<p>In August of 2012 Jessica&#8217;s best friend and husband had been diagnosed with melanoma on his scalp. Surgeons immediately removed it and everything seemed fine. Six months later, Tommy&#8217;s doctors discovered the cancer had metastasized throughout his lymph nodes, his organs &#8230; everywhere. Jessica&#8217;s Tommy, a loving husband, father, and her most supportive running companion passed away on June 28, 2014.</p>
<p>Back to that dreary day in September of 2013; Jessica told Tommy it would be selfish to race just two days after receiving the devastating news. Tommy would have none of that. He insisted that she run the race because it&#8217;s what she loved to do. So, she listened. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/11/18/ginkgo-jessica-kuhr-odorcic-salty-running-interview/#more-42604'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

Marathon. Flickr Commons image by Michael Dorasch</p></div></p>
<p>I was privileged to interview Colleen de Reuck on a rainy Boulder morning, a week after she’d placed first in her 50-54 age group at the Kona Ironman, which included a 3:19:09 marathon during the hottest part of a very hot day.</p>
<p>I immediately recognized the slight runner with her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail, reminiscent of photos of her determined stride to first place finishes. Colleen was in recovery mode, her entire body fatigued from her recent Herculean effort; yet she didn’t look like she’d competed for over 10 hours only a week before. She’s the consummate professional.</p>
<p>Colleen is gracious and humble. The day after her success at Kona, Deena Kastor broke Colleen&#8217;s almost ten-year-old US masters marathon record at the Chicago Marathon. When I asked her about it she simply said, “Records are made to be broken.” <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/11/10/humble-four-time-olympian-2012-2016-otq/#more-42979'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>Think elite athletes are cut-throat win-at-all costs competitors? Think again! There&#8217;s no better example of how amazing runners of all speeds are than what&#8217;s going down right now in Jacksonville.</p>
<p>In elite and subelite circles, everyone knows <a href="https://twitter.com/rcfannin" target="_blank">Richard Clark Fannin</a>, the elite coordinator for the <a class="zem_slink" title="Gate River Run" href="http://www.gate-riverrun.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Gate River Run</a> 15K race held every March in Jacksonville, Florida. With Richard&#8217;s outreach, the Gate River Run is one of the most competitive races in the country! Richard, always thinking about how to advance the sport, realized that his hometown marathon, the Jacksonville Bank Marathon and Half on January 3, 2016 was six weeks out from the Olympic marathon trials. Better yet, it&#8217;s a flat, fast course! He put the bug in a few ears and something amazing is happening! <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2015/10/22/richard-clark-fannin-sisterhood-and-the-magic-in-jacksonville/#more-42789'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>An image of a young gazelle greets me as Caitlin Smith walks into the tiny coffee shop in Montclair Village above the hills of Oakland. She presents herself like the dancer of her childhood: lithe and delicate, yet strong. She is a two-time Olympic trials qualifier in the women’s marathon, boasting a 2:41:37 personal best.</p>
<p>If being one of the country&#8217;s best marathoners wasn&#8217;t enough, she&#8217;s also an ultra runner, placing first in the Tamalpa Headlands 50k this past August. The multi-talented Caitlin is a running coach, pilates trainer, yoga instructor, doula and artist.

<p>When you think of the Olympic Trials, you probably don&#8217;t picture a fifty-something nun lining up on the starting line, yet in the first U.S. Women&#8217;s Olympic Marathon Trials in 1984, there was Sister Marion Irvine anxiously awaiting the gun in the crowd with Joan Benoit Samuelson and other younger &#8211; much younger &#8211; speedsters.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“There was the grey of the overcast skies and the hair of 54-year old Sister Marion Irvine.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p>So wrote runner and author Jack Welch, describing the first American women competing in the marathon distance at the 1984 Olympic Trials in his popular book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Running-Was-Young-Were/dp/1909457167/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442496522&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=when+running+was+young+and+so+were+we" target="_blank">When Running Was Young and So Were We</a></em>.</p>
<p>I recently met with Marion, the Flying Nun to talk about becoming a runner in middle age and how she became the oldest participant, not only in the women’s marathon but also in ANY event at those Olympic Trials!</p>

<p>“Hey—there goes Kristin!”, my friend gestured to the right as a handful of runners sped past our car.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s crazy,” I murmured, awestruck. I was a half hour away from running my first 5k, and the idea of running <i>before</i> a race, the idea of running even a yard more than 3.1 miles seemed two strides short of lunacy.</p>
<p>Kristin Barry went on to finish that 2007 race in 16:51, just 8 seconds shy of her PR, taking the top female spot and besting her then new training partner Sheri Piers by nearly 30 seconds. I went on to&#8230; finish. And to remain in awe of my speedy neighbor and friend.</p>
<p>A great deal has transpired both on and off the road for Kristin in the seven years since that race, including a 2008 and 2012 showing in the Olympic Trials marathon. As a newly minted masters runner, Barry kindly agreed to share with Salty Running her journey through injury and aging as a competitive runner. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2014/06/23/interview-kristin-barry/#more-33144'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.usatf.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank">USATF</a> made news when they announced a new set of <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/races/tougher-standards-2016-olympic-marathon-trials" target="_blank">Olympic marathon qualifying standards</a> for both men and women. To qualify for the 2016 trials race, men will have to run a &#8216;B&#8217; standard time of 2:18 and women will have to run a &#8216;B&#8217; standard of at least 2:43. The &#8216;A&#8217; standard time for both men and women has also been decreased, to 2:15 for men and 2:37 for women. The logic given for this decision is to increase the level of athleticism and competitiveness in the trials race, which is backed up by the increase in runners (both men and women) from 2008 to 2012, despite a tightening of standards between those two Olympic years as well. <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com/2012/12/10/faster-olympic-trials-standards-marathon-yay-or-nay/#more-16916'" class="more-link">more »</a></p></div>
