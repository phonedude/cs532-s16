Located in the Midwest, Southwest and most of the Southeast, the New Heartland is a powerful cultural segment that is largely misunderstood and underserved by advertisers. This massive group is connected to each other by a shared set of core values which guide key purchasing decisions. Those values include faith (not religion), community and family. When brands make an effort to reach this segment (which makes up 60% of U.S. consumers, by the way) they do so with great success if they can understand what makes New Heartlanders tick.\r\n\r\n<strong>Winner: RAM &ldquo;God Made a Farmer&rdquo;</strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMpZ0TGjbWE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nHands down, one of the most memorable Super Bowl ads when it comes to reaching the New Heartland was the RAM &ldquo;God Made a Farmer&rdquo; spot in 2013. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the ad (and even if you have), watch it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMpZ0TGjbWE\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The reason this approach works for the New Heartland is simple &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t shy away from faith. 40% of New Heartlanders find faith critically important when making a purchase decision; we are also 40% more likely to find faith a very effective advertising element. Not many brands are willing to touch &ldquo;faith&rdquo; with a ten-foot pole, let alone put God front and center in a Super Bowl ad. When you consider that the top 10 most religious states are in the New Heartland, brands trying to build a relationship with that audience without at least acknowledging the role of faith creates a big miss. Hats off to RAM for not being afraid to address the praying elephant in the room &ndash; with over 19 million views on YouTube, it&rsquo;s safe to say they won big with this ad.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Winner: Cheerios &ldquo;Gracie&rdquo;</strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oB6r_j55iVs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAnother Super Bowl ad that tugged at the heartstrings of the New Heartland was the Cheerios &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB6r_j55iVs\" target=\"_blank\">Gracie</a>&rdquo; ad, which aired in 2014. Family is another one of our core values, and our research shows that New Heartlanders are 79% more motivated to buy brands that use families in ad campaigns. This ad was a sequel to the original Cheerios &ldquo;Gracie&rdquo; ad that featured a bi-racial family. In the New Heartland, we have found that regardless of age, gender, or race, three core values &ndash; faith, community and family &ndash; are unwavering.\r\n\r\n<strong>Winner: Chrysler &ldquo;Detroit Is Here To Stay&rdquo;</strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKL254Y_jtc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL254Y_jtc\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysler ad</a> that aired in the 2011 Super Bowl touched on the core value of community, as well as New Heartland second-tier values like hard work, loyalty and love of country. Chrysler left no room for interpretation with this commercial &ndash; &ldquo;Detroit is here to stay.&rdquo; The smart tagline of &ldquo;Imported from Detroit&rdquo; is a perfect example of the sense of community and pride that lives there. There&rsquo;s a reason that two-thirds of national brands invest in local marketing efforts to connect with people in their hometown communities. Imagine how the people of Detroit felt when they saw this ad &ndash; pride, encouragement, and a strong connection with the Chrysler brand. I&rsquo;m not even from Detroit and that&rsquo;s how I felt. Key takeaway from this ad: never underestimate the power of connecting with a local community to strengthen your brand.\r\n\r\nThe Super Bowl has certainly birthed some all-star ad campaigns, but it has also generated some serious &ldquo;flops.&rdquo;&nbsp; 96% of New Heartland consumers say that brands don&rsquo;t understand them, and the following ads support that statement.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<strong>Loser: Fiat &ldquo;Viagra 500X&rdquo; </strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lcc62nrl9Y\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nMany times companies outside the U.S. trying to do business here don&rsquo;t have the insights needed to connect with our culture, especially in the New Heartland. Fiat and their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lcc62nrl9Y\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Super Bowl ad</a> is a great example. In an effort to jump-start its sales in America, Fiat purchased a one-minute Super Bowl commercial that, including production, cost well over $10 million. The company wanted the 500X crossover to be seen as a sexy new vehicle. The ad starts with an older couple in the mood for love, and it somehow leads to a Viagra pill getting into the gas tank of a compact car, which grows into the 500X. The tagline: \"Bigger, more powerful and ready for action.\" But here's the kicker: From January to October, Fiat sold 5,634 500X vehicles. With an average net profit of $850 each, the company made $4.8 million on them in the first 10 months of 2015. Not even enough to pay for the commercial and a total disconnect culturally.\r\n\r\n<strong>Loser: Holiday Inn &ldquo;Transsexual&rdquo;</strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0FhjgxjAJxU\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nHoliday Inn took a shock and awe approach with their 1997 Super Bowl ad titled, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FhjgxjAJxU\" target=\"_blank\">Transsexual</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their goal was to communicate to consumers the billion dollar campaign they had planned to upgrade their facilities. The New Heartlander&rsquo;s response may have been scrambling to find the remote to change the channel. This ad strikes a nerve with the faith and family pillars of New Heartlanders&hellip;and not in a good way. Holiday Inn has always been thought of as a family-friendly brand and transsexuality is a very risky and polarizing topic, especially in 1997.\r\n\r\n<strong>Loser: Nationwide &ldquo;Dead Kid&rdquo;</strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRVslkan08U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nOur last Super Bowl commercial bust goes to Nationwide. Their &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRVslkan08U\" target=\"_blank\">Dead Kid</a>&rdquo; spot in 2015 is considered the worst ad of the social media era. The folks at Nationwide said they had no clue it would elicit such a reaction. Just in case you missed it, a cute kid spends most of the commercial telling us he wouldn't get to do various activities. In the end, he reveals the reason, \"I couldn't grow up, because I died from an accident.\"\r\n\r\nMany ripped Nationwide for trying to sell insurance by scaring us about our children&rsquo;s mortality. Nationwide, for its part, said it wasn't trying to sell insurance; it was trying to start a conversation about keeping our children safe. The only conversation that came out of that spot was about poor taste and poor execution. Like everywhere in the U.S. and especially in the New Heartland, using fear tactics related to kids is off limits.\r\n\r\nThe Super Bowl gives brands a major platform, but that&rsquo;s not the point. It&rsquo;s one thing to cast a huge net; it&rsquo;s another to land some fish. How many millions of dollars are spent on messages that never register&hellip;never deliver? A Super Bowl ad targeted to the New Heartland audience has a great chance to be successful because the Super Bowl is one of the few times in television viewing that people actually discuss the ad and what it means to them. Moms, kids and of course sport-junkie guys are gathered around chips and queso, ready to rip poorly orchestrated ads to pieces, or to cry into their nachos if the ad resonates.\r\n\r\nTo this end, Super Bowl advertisements have incredibly high potential to reach the 60% of U.S. consumers that live in the <a href=\"http://www.newheartlandgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\">New Heartland</a>. They also have the ability to show how poorly a brand understands the middle of the country.\r\n\r\nHappy watching and may the best team&hellip;and ad, win.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[brightcove videoID=4736720267001 playerID=]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"In honor of Super Bowl Sunday, let’s take a trip down memory lane and revisit the very best and the very worst Super Bowl ads in terms of reaching the New Heartland.

Located in the Midwest, Southwest and most of the Southeast, the New Heartland is a powerful cultural segment that is largely misunderstood and underserved by advertisers. This massive group is connected to each other by a shared set of core values which guide key purchasing decisions. Those values include faith (not religion), community and family. When brands make an effort to reach this segment (which makes up 60% of U.S. consumers, by the way) they do so with great success if they can understand what makes New Heartlanders tick.</p>\n<p><strong>Winner: RAM “God Made a Farmer”</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMpZ0TGjbWE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Hands down, one of the most memorable Super Bowl ads when it comes to reaching the New Heartland was the RAM “God Made a Farmer” spot in 2013. If you haven’t seen the ad (and even if you have), watch it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMpZ0TGjbWE\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The reason this approach works for the New Heartland is simple – it doesn’t shy away from faith. 40% of New Heartlanders find faith critically important when making a purchase decision; we are also 40% more likely to find faith a very effective advertising element. Not many brands are willing to touch “faith” with a ten-foot pole, let alone put God front and center in a Super Bowl ad. When you consider that the top 10 most religious states are in the New Heartland, brands trying to build a relationship with that audience without at least acknowledging the role of faith creates a big miss. Hats off to RAM for not being afraid to address the praying elephant in the room – with over 19 million views on YouTube, it’s safe to say they won big with this ad.</p>\n<p><strong>Winner: Cheerios “Gracie”</strong></p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oB6r_j55iVs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Another Super Bowl ad that tugged at the heartstrings of the New Heartland was the Cheerios “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB6r_j55iVs\" target=\"_blank\">Gracie</a>” ad, which aired in 2014. Family is another one of our core values, and our research shows that New Heartlanders are 79% more motivated to buy brands that use families in ad campaigns. This ad was a sequel to the original Cheerios “Gracie” ad that featured a bi-racial family. In the New Heartland, we have found that regardless of age, gender, or race, three core values – faith, community and family – are unwavering.</p>\n<p><strong>Winner: Chrysler “Detroit Is Here To Stay”</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKL254Y_jtc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL254Y_jtc\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysler ad</a> that aired in the 2011 Super Bowl touched on the core value of community, as well as New Heartland second-tier values like hard work, loyalty and love of country. Chrysler left no room for interpretation with this commercial – “Detroit is here to stay.” The smart tagline of “Imported from Detroit” is a perfect example of the sense of community and pride that lives there. There’s a reason that two-thirds of national brands invest in local marketing efforts to connect with people in their hometown communities. Imagine how the people of Detroit felt when they saw this ad – pride, encouragement, and a strong connection with the Chrysler brand. I’m not even from Detroit and that’s how I felt. Key takeaway from this ad: never underestimate the power of connecting with a local community to strengthen your brand.</p>\n<p>The Super Bowl has certainly birthed some all-star ad campaigns, but it has also generated some serious “flops.”&nbsp; 96% of New Heartland consumers say that brands don’t understand them, and the following ads support that statement.</p>","<p><strong>Loser: Fiat “Viagra 500X” </strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lcc62nrl9Y\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Many times companies outside the U.S. trying to do business here don’t have the insights needed to connect with our culture, especially in the New Heartland. Fiat and their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lcc62nrl9Y\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Super Bowl ad</a> is a great example. In an effort to jump-start its sales in America, Fiat purchased a one-minute Super Bowl commercial that, including production, cost well over $10 million. The company wanted the 500X crossover to be seen as a sexy new vehicle. The ad starts with an older couple in the mood for love, and it somehow leads to a Viagra pill getting into the gas tank of a compact car, which grows into the 500X. The tagline: “Bigger, more powerful and ready for action.” But here’s the kicker: From January to October, Fiat sold 5,634 500X vehicles. With an average net profit of $850 each, the company made $4.8 million on them in the first 10 months of 2015. Not even enough to pay for the commercial and a total disconnect culturally.</p>\n<p><strong>Loser: Holiday Inn “Transsexual”</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0FhjgxjAJxU\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Holiday Inn took a shock and awe approach with their 1997 Super Bowl ad titled, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FhjgxjAJxU\" target=\"_blank\">Transsexual</a>.”&nbsp; Their goal was to communicate to consumers the billion dollar campaign they had planned to upgrade their facilities. The New Heartlander’s response may have been scrambling to find the remote to change the channel. This ad strikes a nerve with the faith and family pillars of New Heartlanders…and not in a good way. Holiday Inn has always been thought of as a family-friendly brand and transsexuality is a very risky and polarizing topic, especially in 1997.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>Loser: Nationwide “Dead Kid”</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRVslkan08U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Our last Super Bowl commercial bust goes to Nationwide. Their “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRVslkan08U\" target=\"_blank\">Dead Kid</a>” spot in 2015 is considered the worst ad of the social media era. The folks at Nationwide said they had no clue it would elicit such a reaction. Just in case you missed it, a cute kid spends most of the commercial telling us he wouldn’t get to do various activities. In the end, he reveals the reason, “I couldn’t grow up, because I died from an accident.”</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Many ripped Nationwide for trying to sell insurance by scaring us about our children’s mortality. Nationwide, for its part, said it wasn’t trying to sell insurance; it was trying to start a conversation about keeping our children safe. The only conversation that came out of that spot was about poor taste and poor execution. Like everywhere in the U.S. and especially in the New Heartland, using fear tactics related to kids is off limits.</p>\n<p>The Super Bowl gives brands a major platform, but that’s not the point. It’s one thing to cast a huge net; it’s another to land some fish. How many millions of dollars are spent on messages that never register…never deliver? A Super Bowl ad targeted to the New Heartland audience has a great chance to be successful because the Super Bowl is one of the few times in television viewing that people actually discuss the ad and what it means to them. Moms, kids and of course sport-junkie guys are gathered around chips and queso, ready to rip poorly orchestrated ads to pieces, or to cry into their nachos if the ad resonates.</p>\n<p>To this end, Super Bowl advertisements have incredibly high potential to reach the 60% of U.S. consumers that live in the <a href=\"http://www.newheartlandgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\">New Heartland</a>. They also have the ability to show how poorly a brand understands the middle of the country.</p>\n<p>Happy watching and may the best team…and ad, win.</p>\n<div fbs-brightcove-perform=\"4736720267001\" sz=\"620x350\" key_value_string=\"\" autoplay=\"false\" player-id=\"NJOvFZMYl\" select-rendition=\"max\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_4section_28","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","sectionName":"Sales & Marketing","url":"/sales-marketing"},{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_42","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"CMO Network","url":"/cmo-network"}],"pTagCount":26,"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/101515","name":"Paul Jankowski","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/pauljankowski/files/2014/08/Paul-Jankowski_avatar_1409151955-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/pauljankowski/files/2014/08/Paul-Jankowski_avatar_1409151955-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/pauljankowski/files/2014/08/Paul-Jankowski_avatar_1409151955-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/pauljankowski/files/2014/08/Paul-Jankowski_avatar_1409151955-400x400.jpg"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/pauljankowski/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/pauljankowski/","twitterName":"pauljankowski1","authorType":"individual","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauljankowski1","email":"paul@newheartlandgroup.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about building sustainable brands","amazon":"http://www.newheartlandgroup.com","webSite":"http://www.newheartlandgroup.com/","timestamp":1455410411935,"description":"I'm the Chief Strategist at New Heartland Group, a brand strategy/consumer engagement agency in Nashville, TN.
