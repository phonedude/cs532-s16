The GM brand plans to promote their Cascada convertible with their stars New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and model Emily Ratajkowski.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"\" width=\"2808\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/56a7e12558c3239d078b5599-2808-1872/buick-cascada-Superbowl-ad.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"1872\" data-width=\"2808\"> New York Giant Odell Beckham Junior and model Emily Ratajkowski will star in Buick's Super Bowl 50 ad. (Credit: Buick)[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Hyundai</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Super Bowl 50, Hyundai will pull out all the stops. The automobile manufacturer is the official car and a sponsor of the NFL. Furthermore, Hyundai will air two 30-second in-game ads, one 60-second pre-kickoff spot and one 60-second pre-game ad. Using the approximate rate of $5 million per 30 seconds, these four ads cost Hyundai $40 million (though Hyundai's NFL involvement probably sweetened the deal). Each commercial has a critically-acclaimed director.\r\n\r\nHyundai has revealed two teaser ads that are pretty mysterious. The one below features actor Ryan Gosling, who is well-known for his appeal to the female demographic...\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"tpa3sTKzkP4\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>LG</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is LG's Super Bowl debut, but the consumer electronics company seems to know what it's doing. Jake Scott will be directing the commercial for LG's new line of TVs with OLED (\"organic light-emitting diodes\") technology. Scott's famous father, director Ridley Scott, is the ad's executive producer. Jeremy Scott also directed Budweiser's popular \"Lost Puppy\" commercial and other hit ads.&nbsp;Furthermore, LG has cast actor Liam Neeson as \"Man from the Future.\" Last year, Neeson starred in the successful Super Bowl commercial for Clash of Clans. Similar to the \"Revenge\" ad for the iOS game, LG's teaser imitates the Neeson's action movies.\r\n\r\nLG released their second teaser ad on January 26th, which is below. The first can be watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIXTleu6TLo&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"WWCLhBzkAE8\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Marmot</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is Marmot's Super Bowl debut. The outdoor gear company's 30-second commercial will star Aah, a large, furry marmot. Three teasers have been released and each features Aah and his friend adventuring in the outdoors. The teaser below features Aah peeing off a cliff, so all bets are off for the actual commercial.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"06BrmkdmKlI\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Persil ProClean</strong>\r\n\r\nThe laundry detergent company has been on the market for less than a year in the U.S. and hopes to make a big impression on their new consumer base. Their hashtag #GameDayStains is definitely on point.\r\n\r\nThis teaser was released on January 26th.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"Jj_3TbeY9wM\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>SunTrust</strong>\r\n\r\nSuntrust has previously purchased local ads during the Super Bowl, but this is their first ad to air in The Big Game. The 30-second ad will air before the two-minute warning of the fourth quarter. The \"Hold Your Breath\" teaser is pretty vague.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"ntfe79blgLI\"]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">JANUARY 25TH</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Bai</strong>\r\n\r\nBai&nbsp;is the most obscure beverage to have an ad in Golden Super Bowl and it's also the healthiest. The drink claims to have tons of antioxidants and only five calories. The commercial is consistent with Bai's \"None of this makes sense\" campaign. Honestly, considering their beverage brand competitors for the Super Bowl, which include [entity display=\"Coca-Cola\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"coca-cola\" ticker=\"KO\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1020\"]Coca-Cola[/entity] and [entity display=\"Budweiser\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"budweiser\" natural_id=\"fred/company/91201\"]Budweiser[/entity], it doesn't make much sense for Bai to fork over millions for their quirky spot.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"http://static1.i4u.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/main_image_large/images/2016/01/bai-super-bowl-50-ad.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"370\" data-width=\"650\"> Film still from Bai's Super Bowl advertisement. (Credit: Bai)[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Pok&eacute;mon</strong>\r\n\r\nGiven the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2015/11/25/snoopy-vs-spongebob-the-numbers-behind-macys-thankgiving-day-parade-characters/\" target=\"_blank\">strength and longevity of the Pok&eacute;mon&nbsp;franchise</a>, it's surprising this is the gaming company's first Super Bowl commercial. The 30-second ad will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first [entity display=\"Nintendo\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"nintendo\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3088\"]Nintendo[/entity] games, \"Pok&eacute;mon Red\" and \"Pok&eacute;mon Green. Last year's Clash of Clans ad fared well,&nbsp;which bodes well for the&nbsp;#Pokemon20 commercial.\r\n\r\nNinetendo was the first company to release their full-length Super Bowl ad. Skip ahead to 0:49 to see actual Pokemon.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"2F46tGehnfo\"]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">JANUARY 20TH</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>SoFi</strong>\r\n\r\nSilicon Valley start-up SoFi (Social Finance Inc.) has spent 20% of their annual advertising budget on their first-ever Super Bowl ad. Their brief but intriguing tagline is, \"Don't Bank. SoFi.\"\r\n\r\nThe below ad is one of seven that SoFi will release before February 7th.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"KWNsjjjDj_0\"]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">JANUARY 10TH</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"></span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Kia</strong>\r\n\r\nCar manufacturer will air a 60-second ad in the third quarter of the Golden Super Bowl. Kia's previous six commercials have fared well. The ad will promote the Kia Optima and star Christopher Walken and a polka-dotted sock...\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"WfswTuVSN_A\"]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">DECEMBER 31ST, 2015</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>TurboTax</strong>\r\n\r\nTurboTax, which provides the user-friendly online tax filing service, will air its third Super Bowl ad. The tagline for TurboTax's campaign is, \"It doesn't take a genius to do your taxes.\"\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"UV5Wo7YrZIU\"]\r\n\r\n<b>These brands have kept their commercials under wraps, but here is what we know so far...</b>\r\n\r\n<strong>Colgate</strong>\r\n\r\nThe toothpaste giant is making its Super Bowl debut and going the environmental route.&nbsp;Their commercial is a 30-second public service announcement encouraging people to conserve water. The \"Save Water\" ad will air during the 2-minute warning of the second half of the game.\r\n\r\n<strong>Honda</strong>\r\n\r\nHonda has purchased 60 seconds of Golden Super Bowl airtime to promote their 2017 Ridgeline truck. The ad will air during the third quarter.\r\n\r\n<strong>Michelob Ultra</strong>\r\n\r\nMichelob Ultra is entering The Big Game for the first time in six years. The beer brand is playing their cards close to their chest. Last time, their ad starred disgraced athlete <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/lance-armstrong/'>Lance Armstrong</a>...\r\n\r\n<strong>[entity display=\"PayPal\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"paypal\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102626\"]PayPal[/entity]</strong>\r\n\r\nOddly enough, PayPal will air a 45-second ad. There are no other details at this time.\r\n\r\n<strong>WeatherTech</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Big Game might be able to inject some excitement into WeatherTech, which produces car floor mats. The company has not released any teasers yet, but we can guess from WeatherTech's two previous Super Bowl ads that the commercial will emphasize that heir products are American-made.\r\n\r\n<strong>Stay tuned for more updates...</strong>","description":"Check out the latest on SuperBowl 50 ads with the Forbes Tracker!
