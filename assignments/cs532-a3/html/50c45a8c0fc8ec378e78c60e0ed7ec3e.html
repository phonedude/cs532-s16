It started <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/01/28/super-bowl-ad-watching-as-stock-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">seven years ago</a>. This year, I decided to write the story myself.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, as millions of people around the world tune in to watch the Carolina Panthers face off against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50, they will also watch and enjoy <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/best-super-bowl-commercials-watch-10-greatest-ads-all-time-2295233\" target=\"_blank\">the television commercials</a>. There have been many memorable ones. Remember Mean Joe Greene gulping down that [entity display=\"Coca-Cola\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"coca-cola\" ticker=\"KO\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1020\"]Coca-Cola[/entity], or Cindy Crawford purchasing that [entity display=\"Pepsi\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"pepsi\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3347\"]Pepsi[/entity]? And even after all these years, we still talk about the &ldquo;talking&rdquo; Budweiser frogs and [entity display=\"Apple\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"apple\" ticker=\"AAPL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/280\"]Apple[/entity]&rsquo;s iconic &ldquo;1984&rdquo; commercial. Super Bowl commercials are famous for their entertainment value, but they are also well-known for their costs. This year, to air a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl, it will <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/06/super-bowl-ad-cost/\" target=\"_blank\">cost around $5 million</a>. Is it worth it?\r\n\r\nOne of my areas of specialization is behavioral finance. While I was watching the Super Bowl one year, and laughing at the funny commercials, I wondered what kind of an effect these entertaining commercials had on the stocks of the firms that aired those ads. So, the next day, I started looking up past Super Bowl commercials and identified the most liked commercials according to USA Today&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://admeter.usatoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ad Meter</a> to see if Super Bowl ad likeability had any immediate effect on the firm&rsquo;s stock price. When I looked at the data, I started to see a pattern. When a firm&rsquo;s Super Bowl commercial was highly liked, it enjoyed a stock price bump on the Monday following the Super Bowl. I <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176509000330\" target=\"_blank\">published my findings</a> in an academic journal, and since then I&rsquo;ve enjoyed quite a bit of media attention around this time of year leading up to the Super Bowl.\r\n\r\n<strong>Why the stock price bump?</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen firms air liked Super Bowl commercials, why do they subsequently enjoy a stock price bump on the Monday after the game? I attribute this finding to something known as the representativeness bias. We have a tendency to assume that certain characteristics imply other characteristics, even though our perception of the link between the two characteristics may be irrational or very weak. For example, we might think that a clean car is a well-running car, even though car cleanliness has nothing to do with the car&rsquo;s engine, or that a boy with a nice haircut is a good boy, even though anyone can get a nice haircut. And for me personally, as a professor, I used to think that my nice students were going to ace the test, even though one&rsquo;s niceness may have little to do with one&rsquo;s work ethic. This representativeness bias can also affect our investment decision-making. For example, we might think that past returns is indicative of future returns.\r\n\r\nSo, I believe that when we (which includes people who invest) watch a Super Bowl commercial and we like it, we also end up liking the firm that aired that commercial, which consequently leads to a net buying of those firm&rsquo;s stocks. In my study, I argued that this is why Super Bowl commercial likeability correlates positively with stock returns on the Monday after the game.\r\n\r\n<strong>Alternative explanations</strong>\r\n\r\nOf course, there is the possibility that Super Bowl commercials are effective not simply because they are liked, but because the commercial reminds us of the firm and their goods or services, which lead to increased sales. In my published paper, I tested these alternative explanations and ruled them out. It seems as though when we like a firm&rsquo;s Super Bowl commercial, we just simply like the firm and its stock.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<strong>Does the effect still hold?</strong>\r\n\r\nBecause I published my study many years ago, I often get asked if the effect has held up in recent years. It looks like the effect has sort of worn off, and my guess is that this is mostly because we have come to expect likeable Super Bowl commercials from certain firms, such as Budweiser or Doritos (which is owned by Pepsi). But <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2015/02/02/why-budweiser-bmw-and-other-super-bowl-ad-winners-arent-seeing-stocks-surge/#468b402819c8\" target=\"_blank\">the effect still seems to linger</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the cost of the commercial worth it?</strong>\r\n\r\nTo get back to the question of whether or not the cost of Super Bowl advertising is worth it, I think the answer is that it seems so. After all, if a firm is able to get a modest 0.1% stock price boost from airing a likeable Super Bowl commercial, and if that firm&rsquo;s market capitalization is $100 billion, then the 0.1% stock price boost means an extra $100 million in market capitalization.\r\n\r\n<strong>Can investors make money on this effect?</strong>\r\n\r\nAs expected, I am often asked if there is a <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/video/13026467/a-popular-super-bowl-ad-may-mean-a-boost-to-a-firms-stock-price.html\" target=\"_blank\">way we can make money</a> off of this effect. The answer is: probably not. You'd have to guess, ahead of time, which firms are going to surprise everyone by airing a highly liked Super Bowl commercial, and then buy those firms&rsquo; stocks before the Super Bowl. I wouldn&rsquo;t try to do this. One can never tell what people are going to like. And besides, it&rsquo;s more fun predicting the score. I'm predicting Broncos over the Panthers, 21-17.","description":"Super Bowl ads are often (but not always) highly entertaining. They are, however, always expensive. Is it worth the expense?

It started <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/01/28/super-bowl-ad-watching-as-stock-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">seven years ago</a>. This year, I decided to write the story myself.</p>\n<p>On February 7, as millions of people around the world tune in to watch the Carolina Panthers face off against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50, they will also watch and enjoy <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/best-super-bowl-commercials-watch-10-greatest-ads-all-time-2295233\" target=\"_blank\">the television commercials</a>. There have been many memorable ones. Remember Mean Joe Greene gulping down that <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"KO\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/1020\" data-quotes-closing=\"42.41\" data-quotes-now=\"43.11\" data-link=\"/companies/coca-cola\" data-name=\"Coca-Cola\"></span>, or Cindy Crawford purchasing that <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"null\" data-exchange=\"null\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/3347\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/pepsi\" data-name=\"Pepsi\"></span>? And even after all these years, we still talk about the “talking” Budweiser frogs and <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"AAPL\" data-exchange=\"NASDAQ\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/280\" data-quotes-closing=\"93.66\" data-quotes-now=\"93.99\" data-link=\"/companies/apple\" data-name=\"Apple\"></span>’s iconic “1984” commercial. Super Bowl commercials are famous for their entertainment value, but they are also well-known for their costs. This year, to air a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl, it will <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/06/super-bowl-ad-cost/\" target=\"_blank\">cost around $5 million</a>. Is it worth it?</p>\n<p>One of my areas of specialization is behavioral finance. While I was watching the Super Bowl one year, and laughing at the funny commercials, I wondered what kind of an effect these entertaining commercials had on the stocks of the firms that aired those ads. So, the next day, I started looking up past Super Bowl commercials and identified the most liked commercials according to USA Today’s <a href=\"http://admeter.usatoday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ad Meter</a> to see if Super Bowl ad likeability had any immediate effect on the firm’s stock price. When I looked at the data, I started to see a pattern. When a firm’s Super Bowl commercial was highly liked, it enjoyed a stock price bump on the Monday following the Super Bowl. I <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176509000330\" target=\"_blank\">published my findings</a> in an academic journal, and since then I’ve enjoyed quite a bit of media attention around this time of year leading up to the Super Bowl.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>Why the stock price bump?</strong></p>\n<p>When firms air liked Super Bowl commercials, why do they subsequently enjoy a stock price bump on the Monday after the game? I attribute this finding to something known as the representativeness bias. We have a tendency to assume that certain characteristics imply other characteristics, even though our perception of the link between the two characteristics may be irrational or very weak. For example, we might think that a clean car is a well-running car, even though car cleanliness has nothing to do with the car’s engine, or that a boy with a nice haircut is a good boy, even though anyone can get a nice haircut. And for me personally, as a professor, I used to think that my nice students were going to ace the test, even though one’s niceness may have little to do with one’s work ethic. This representativeness bias can also affect our investment decision-making. For example, we might think that past returns is indicative of future returns.</p>\n<p>So, I believe that when we (which includes people who invest) watch a Super Bowl commercial and we like it, we also end up liking the firm that aired that commercial, which consequently leads to a net buying of those firm’s stocks. In my study, I argued that this is why Super Bowl commercial likeability correlates positively with stock returns on the Monday after the game.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Alternative explanations</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, there is the possibility that Super Bowl commercials are effective not simply because they are liked, but because the commercial reminds us of the firm and their goods or services, which lead to increased sales. In my published paper, I tested these alternative explanations and ruled them out. It seems as though when we like a firm’s Super Bowl commercial, we just simply like the firm and its stock.</p>","<p><strong>Does the effect still hold?</strong></p>\n<p>Because I published my study many years ago, I often get asked if the effect has held up in recent years. It looks like the effect has sort of worn off, and my guess is that this is mostly because we have come to expect likeable Super Bowl commercials from certain firms, such as Budweiser or Doritos (which is owned by Pepsi). But <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2015/02/02/why-budweiser-bmw-and-other-super-bowl-ad-winners-arent-seeing-stocks-surge/#468b402819c8\" target=\"_self\">the effect still seems to linger</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the cost of the commercial worth it?</strong></p>\n<p>To get back to the question of whether or not the cost of Super Bowl advertising is worth it, I think the answer is that it seems so. After all, if a firm is able to get a modest 0.1% stock price boost from airing a likeable Super Bowl commercial, and if that firm’s market capitalization is $100 billion, then the 0.1% stock price boost means an extra $100 million in market capitalization.</p>\n<p><strong>Can investors make money on this effect?</strong></p>\n<p>As expected, I am often asked if there is a <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/video/13026467/a-popular-super-bowl-ad-may-mean-a-boost-to-a-firms-stock-price.html\" target=\"_blank\">way we can make money</a> off of this effect. The answer is: probably not. You’d have to guess, ahead of time, which firms are going to surprise everyone by airing a highly liked Super Bowl commercial, and then buy those firms’ stocks before the Super Bowl. I wouldn’t try to do this. One can never tell what people are going to like. And besides, it’s more fun predicting the score. I’m predicting Broncos over the Panthers, 21-17.</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_3","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Media & Entertainment","url":"/media-entertainment"},{"id":"channel_1section_5","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"SportsMoney","url":"/sportsmoney"},{"id":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing"},{"id":"channel_2section_64","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Stocks","url":"/stocks"},{"id":"channel_4section_28","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","sectionName":"Sales & Marketing","url":"/sales-marketing"},{"id":"channel_7","channelName":"Lifestyle","url":"/lifestyle"},{"id":"channel_7section_95","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Sports & Leisure","url":"/sports-leisure"}],"pTagCount":15,"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3998","name":"Kenneth Kim","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kennethkim/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/kennethkim/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1455410457860,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3998","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1862489","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1862489","name":"Kenneth Kim","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/09/kennethkim_avatar_1443633663-40x40.jpeg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/09/kennethkim_avatar_1443633663-62x62.jpeg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/09/kennethkim_avatar_1443633663-136x136.jpeg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/09/kennethkim_avatar_1443633663-400x400.jpeg"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about the markets, economy, and investing in Asia and the U.S.","description":"I am currently Chief Financial Strategist for EQIS Capital, a Turnkey Asset Management Platform in the San Francisco Bay Area.
