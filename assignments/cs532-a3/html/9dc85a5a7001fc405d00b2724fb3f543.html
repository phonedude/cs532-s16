Sean Packard</strong>\r\n\r\nRemember when <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/peyton-manning/'>Peyton Manning</a> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/01/27/new-jersey-taxes-could-eat-up-all-of-peyton-mannings-super-bowl-earnings/#d38c6c14c324\">paid New Jersey nearly $47,000</a> in <a href='http://www.forbes.com/taxes/'>taxes</a> two years ago on his Super Bowl earnings of $46,000? Manning has nothing on the state taxes facing Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton for Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, Calif. Newton is looking at a tax bill more than twice as much, which will swallow up his entire Super Bowl paycheck, win or lose, thanks to California&rsquo;s tops-in-the-nation tax rate of 13.3%.\r\n\r\nBefore we get into the numbers, let&rsquo;s do a quick review of the jock tax rules applied to professional athletes (similar tax rules apply to anyone doing business across state lines, but they are rarely enforced). States tax a player based on their calendar-year income. They apply a duty day calculation which takes the ratio of duty days within the state over total duty days for the year. That ratio is then multiplied by the player&rsquo;s salary to arrive at a state&rsquo;s allocable income.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"\" width=\"3598\"]<img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/56b20856e4b096c51c62cd8a/x.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"2399\" data-width=\"3598\"> Cam Newton celebrates during the NFC Championship Game. (Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Manning would have paid New Jersey a 51% rate on his $92,000 earned had the Denver Broncos won Super Bowl 48. Unfortunately for them and Manning&rsquo;s legacy, they were blown out by a Seattle Seahawks team that knew the right plays to call all night. So Manning paid a whopping 102% tax to New Jersey on his $46,000 consolation prize.\r\n\r\nSkip ahead two years and now Manning is back in the Super Bowl against the highly-talented and highly-compensated Cam Newton, who signed a five-year, $103.8 million contract extension in June. Newton has already earned $58,800 so far this year for week 17 of the 2015 season and $71,000 in playoff bonuses. Newton is due a $13 million base salary for the 2016 season plus $7 million, which is the deferred part of his $22.5 million signing bonus from last year's contract. Luckily, week 17 next season will occur on New Year&rsquo;s Day 2017, thus shielding about $765,000 from California&rsquo;s grasp.\r\n\r\nIf the Panthers win the Super Bowl, Newton will earn another $102,000 in playoff bonuses, but if they lose he will only net another $51,000. The Panthers will have about 206 total duty days during 2016, including the playoffs, preseason, regular season and organized team activities (OTAs), which Newton must attend or lose $500,000. Seven of those duty days will be in California for the Super Bowl and another four will be in the Golden State for road games against <del>St. Louis</del>&nbsp;Los Angeles and Oakland next season.\r\n\r\nWin on Sunday, and Newton will pay California a total of $138,250 in taxes in 2016. Lose, and he will pay $137,900 based on an income reduction of $51,000.\r\n\r\nTo determine what Newton will pay California on his Super Bowl winnings alone, we will ignore the four 2016 season duty days and pretend they are being played elsewhere. In looking at the seven days Newton will spend in California this week for Super Bowl 50, he will pay the state $88,000 on $102,000 of income should the Panthers be victorious or $87,800 on $51,000 should they lose.\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\nThe result: Newton will pay California 86.3% of his Super Bowl earnings if the Panthers win. Losing means his effective tax rate will be a whopping 172.2%. Oh yeah, he will also pay the IRS 40.5% on his earnings.\r\n\r\nIt is a good bet that the more dabbing we see Cam Newton doing on Sunday, the better the Panthers&rsquo; chances are of winning Super Bowl 50. Either way, California&rsquo;s tax man will be dabbing right along with him all the way to the bank.\r\n\r\n<em>A previous version of this story was based on Newton's 2016 earnings of $23 million. The actual figure is $20 million.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>This is a guest post from K. Sean Packard, CPA, who is Director of Tax at OFS.

Manning has nothing on the state taxes facing Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton for Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, Calif. Newton is looking at a tax bill more than twice as much, which will swallow up his entire Super Bowl paycheck, win or lose, thanks to California’s tops-in-the-nation tax rate of 13.3%.</p>\n<p>Before we get into the numbers, let’s do a quick review of the jock tax rules applied to professional athletes (similar tax rules apply to anyone doing business across state lines, but they are rarely enforced). States tax a player based on their calendar-year income. They apply a duty day calculation which takes the ratio of duty days within the state over total duty days for the year. That ratio is then multiplied by the player’s salary to arrive at a state’s allocable income.</p>\n<div> \n <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/56b20856e4b096c51c62cd8a/x.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-height=\"2399\" data-width=\"3598\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cam Newton celebrates during the NFC Championship Game. (Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>In 2014, Manning would have paid New Jersey a 51% rate on his $92,000 earned had the Denver Broncos won Super Bowl 48. Unfortunately for them and Manning’s legacy, they were blown out by a Seattle Seahawks team that knew the right plays to call all night. So Manning paid a whopping 102% tax to New Jersey on his $46,000 consolation prize.</p>\n<p>Skip ahead two years and now Manning is back in the Super Bowl against the highly-talented and highly-compensated Cam Newton, who signed a five-year, $103.8 million contract extension in June. Newton has already earned $58,800 so far this year for week 17 of the 2015 season and $71,000 in playoff bonuses. Newton is due a $13 million base salary for the 2016 season plus $7 million, which is the deferred part of his $22.5 million signing bonus from last year’s contract. Luckily, week 17 next season will occur on New Year’s Day 2017, thus shielding about $765,000 from California’s grasp.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>If the Panthers win the Super Bowl, Newton will earn another $102,000 in playoff bonuses, but if they lose he will only net another $51,000. The Panthers will have about 206 total duty days during 2016, including the playoffs, preseason, regular season and organized team activities (OTAs), which Newton must attend or lose $500,000. Seven of those duty days will be in California for the Super Bowl and another four will be in the Golden State for road games against <del>St. Louis</del>&nbsp;Los Angeles and Oakland next season.</p>\n<p>Win on Sunday, and Newton will pay California a total of $138,250 in taxes in 2016. Lose, and he will pay $137,900 based on an income reduction of $51,000.</p>\n<p>To determine what Newton will pay California on his Super Bowl winnings alone, we will ignore the four 2016 season duty days and pretend they are being played elsewhere. In looking at the seven days Newton will spend in California this week for Super Bowl 50, he will pay the state $88,000 on $102,000 of income should the Panthers be victorious or $87,800 on $51,000 should they lose.</p>\n<p>The result: Newton will pay California 86.3% of his Super Bowl earnings if the Panthers win. Losing means his effective tax rate will be a whopping 172.2%. Oh yeah, he will also pay the IRS 40.5% on his earnings.</p>\n<p>It is a good bet that the more dabbing we see Cam Newton doing on Sunday, the better the Panthers’ chances are of winning Super Bowl 50. Either way, California’s tax man will be dabbing right along with him all the way to the bank.</p>\n<p><em>A previous version of this story was based on Newton’s 2016 earnings of $23 million.
