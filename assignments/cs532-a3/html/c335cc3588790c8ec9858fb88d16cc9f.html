Peyton Manning, a record-setting five-time National Football League MVP ranks among the greatest quarterbacks of all-time. At 39 years old, Manning is set to become the oldest quarterback to start in the Super Bowl. The longevity alone of his career is impressive.\r\n\r\nGreatness does not happen accidentally. Success in all its forms has universals that can be applied to any discipline. Successful people share behaviors that forge their paths to greatness, and these are behaviors that can be learned and practiced by anyone willing to commit to them. Peyton Manning and the highly successful share three commonalities that have helped them get to and, more importantly, stay at the top.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_508174436\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-508174436\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/508174436/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>1. They are relentless in the face of adversity.</strong>\r\n\r\nManning has had his fair share of adversity that would cripple most people. Neck surgeries in 2011 cost him his entire season. The result of those surgeries left him with no feeling in his fingertips. This would be a deal-breaker for most, but Manning does not shudder in the face of adversity. Manning is relentless about his improvement and finds a way to make it happen. Where most would see this as career-ending, Manning looked at is as another hurdle.\r\n\r\nThose who reach the top and remain at the top in <a href='http://www.forbes.com/business/'>business</a> do not get there because they never faced any obstacles. They get there because they overcome the obstacle, and then the next, and then the next. This seems simple in theory, but very few actually put it into practice. Most give up after a few setbacks. They extremely successful are relentless about pushing forward, no matter how may steps they have fallen backward.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. They do a few things extremely well.&nbsp;</strong>\r\n\r\nSome have said that Manning has the weakest arm of any starting quarterback. What he lacks in arm strength at this point in his career, he more than makes up for with his knowledge of the game. He has notebooks filled with observations and notes about offenses and defenses. Manning is obsessive about studying plays. He doesn&rsquo;t do everything well, but he does some things better than anyone else.\r\n\r\nThe extremely successful do not do everything well. They may even be bad at some things. They do, however, execute a few things extremely well. They have identified what is important, and they become obsessive about those few things.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. They don&rsquo;t get distracted by the unimportant.</strong>\r\n\r\nAn all-star athlete probably knows more than anyone the importance of not getting distracted. The media always has something to say about Peyton Manning, but he is relentless about keeping his focus on the task at hand. Interview questions about anything other than the upcoming game are always answered by Manning with some variation of, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just staying focused on the next step.&rdquo; With the pressure of a Super Bowl, the ability to keep his focus on the task at hand and off the hype is crucial.\r\n\r\nIn my book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Organize-Tomorrow-Today-Optimize-Performance/dp/0738218693/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442959886&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=organize+tomorrow+today\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Organize Tomorrow Today</em></a>, Tom Bartow and I discuss Albert Einstein&rsquo;s list of the five levels of intelligence: <em>1. Smart; 2. Intelligent; 3. Brilliant; 4. Genius;&nbsp;5. Simple</em>. The step beyond genius points to the ability to see beyond the chaos of everyday life and focus on what is important. The most successful people are incredibly wise about where they chose to place their focus. Business professionals deal with the noise of the urgent and unimportant on a daily basis, but the most successful know how to block it out until they have executed their most important tasks.\r\n\r\nLike anyone else in the public eye, Manning has his naysayers, but there is no doubt that he knows how to execute the fundamentals of success. Staying relentless about the simple fundamentals of success can drive anyone to win his or her version of the Super Bowl.\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Watch on Forbes:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n[brightcove videoID=4728591536001 playerID=]</p>","description":"With Super Bowl 50 less than a week away, all eyes are on quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Cam Newton.

Peyton Manning and the highly successful share three commonalities that have helped them get to and, more importantly, stay at the top.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_508174436\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-508174436\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/508174436/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</p> \n</div>\n<p><strong>1. They are relentless in the face of adversity.</strong></p>\n<p>Manning has had his fair share of adversity that would cripple most people. Neck surgeries in 2011 cost him his entire season. The result of those surgeries left him with no feeling in his fingertips. This would be a deal-breaker for most, but Manning does not shudder in the face of adversity. Manning is relentless about his improvement and finds a way to make it happen. Where most would see this as career-ending, Manning looked at is as another hurdle.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Those who reach the top and remain at the top in <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/business/\" target=\"_self\">business</a> do not get there because they never faced any obstacles. They get there because they overcome the obstacle, and then the next, and then the next. This seems simple in theory, but very few actually put it into practice. Most give up after a few setbacks. They extremely successful are relentless about pushing forward, no matter how may steps they have fallen backward.</p>\n<p><strong>2. They do a few things extremely well.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Some have said that Manning has the weakest arm of any starting quarterback. What he lacks in arm strength at this point in his career, he more than makes up for with his knowledge of the game. He has notebooks filled with observations and notes about offenses and defenses. Manning is obsessive about studying plays. He doesn’t do everything well, but he does some things better than anyone else.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>The extremely successful do not do everything well. They may even be bad at some things. They do, however, execute a few things extremely well. They have identified what is important, and they become obsessive about those few things.</p>\n<p><strong>3. They don’t get distracted by the unimportant.</strong></p>\n<p>An all-star athlete probably knows more than anyone the importance of not getting distracted. The media always has something to say about Peyton Manning, but he is relentless about keeping his focus on the task at hand. Interview questions about anything other than the upcoming game are always answered by Manning with some variation of, “I’m just staying focused on the next step.” With the pressure of a Super Bowl, the ability to keep his focus on the task at hand and off the hype is crucial.</p>\n<p>In my book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Organize-Tomorrow-Today-Optimize-Performance/dp/0738218693/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442959886&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=organize+tomorrow+today\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Organize Tomorrow Today</em></a>, Tom Bartow and I discuss Albert Einstein’s list of the five levels of intelligence: <em>1. Smart; 2. Intelligent; 3. Brilliant; 4. Genius;&nbsp;5. Simple</em>. The step beyond genius points to the ability to see beyond the chaos of everyday life and focus on what is important. The most successful people are incredibly wise about where they chose to place their focus. Business professionals deal with the noise of the urgent and unimportant on a daily basis, but the most successful know how to block it out until they have executed their most important tasks.</p>\n<p>Like anyone else in the public eye, Manning has his naysayers, but there is no doubt that he knows how to execute the fundamentals of success. Staying relentless about the simple fundamentals of success can drive anyone to win his or her version of the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Watch on Forbes:</strong></em></p>\n<div fbs-brightcove-perform=\"4728591536001\" sz=\"620x350\" key_value_string=\"\" autoplay=\"false\" player-id=\"NJOvFZMYl\" select-rendition=\"max\"></div>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1section_5","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"SportsMoney","url":"/sportsmoney"},{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_44","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Leaders","url":"/leaders"},{"id":"channel_7section_95","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Sports & Leisure","url":"/sports-leisure"}],"pTagCount":15,"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2308","name":"The Performance Coach","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonselk/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/jasonselk/profile/","authorType":"individual","tagName":"I write about Mental Toughness in sports, business, and life.","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1455410452471,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2308","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/393196","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/393196","name":"Jason Selk","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/91d4a8dc3d48b94271aa3308ac32f960?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/91d4a8dc3d48b94271aa3308ac32f960?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/91d4a8dc3d48b94271aa3308ac32f960?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/91d4a8dc3d48b94271aa3308ac32f960?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about mental toughness in sports, business and life.","description":"I was hired by the St. Louis Cardinals to be their first Director of Mental Training in 2006, and that year they went on to win their first World Series in 20 years.
