You can witness its arrival with the friendly wagers between pals that are being conducted en masse. Perhaps, however, there is no more intriguing way to enjoy Super Bowl&rsquo;s arrival than diving through all the lovely data found in myriad eBay purchases in a report titled <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/the-business-of-the-big-game/\" target=\"_blank\">The Business of the Big Game</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd that&rsquo;s exactly what the online marketplace has given we football fans just days before Lady Gaga belts out the National Anthem, signaling the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers&rsquo; turn to take center stage.\r\n\r\nIn a captivating post on Tuesday, eBay unveiled a deluge of data as pertains to the big game, even going so far as offering up some predictions as to the winner.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1fd5bf51669b4f079d30c57c2943942c\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-1fd5bf51669b4f079d30c57c2943942c\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1fd5bf51669b4f079d30c57c2943942c/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> The Vince Lombardi Trophy is displayed inside the NFL Experience Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016, in San Francisco. The Denver Broncos will play the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 Sunday, Feb. 7, 2016. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThat&rsquo;s right. In time you will have the skinny on which team to place that bet on thanks to the way consumer demands are swaying.\r\n\r\nNow the most striking image is eBay&rsquo;s visual representation of where the nation is situated as far as team specific purchases.\r\n\r\nThe following image represents items purchased from July 22, 2015 to January 27, 2016:\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_324\" align=\"\" width=\"705\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-324\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gabezaldivar/files/2016/02/Screen-shot-2016-02-02-at-4.56.27-PM3-e1454461314233.png\" alt=\"Image courtesy eBay. \"> Image courtesy eBay.[/caption]\r\n\r\nAs the report states, Broncos-specific purchases are indeed spread across a wide swath of the nation. However, Panthers fans are most definitely getting prepared: &ldquo;With orange areas dominating, Denver Broncos merchandise stands out, but don&rsquo;t count the Panthers out just yet. The highest concentration of the heatmap&rsquo;s 229,636 transactions are clustered in the Southeast.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nNow the entire report is chockablock filled with juicy football tidbits. However we have our favorites as pertains to some of the sports biggest stars as well as the moment we all gather in the living room: Halftime.\r\n\r\nHere are just a few points that standout from this data purge.\r\n</p><ul><li>Jersey Superstar - Peyton Manning claims the top spot in jersey sales on eBay among all past Super Bowl players, something represented well in the following.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_322\" align=\"\" width=\"703\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-322\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gabezaldivar/files/2016/02/Screen-shot-2016-02-02-at-4.56.34-PM1.png\" alt=\"Image courtesy eBay. \"> Image courtesy eBay.[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe report continues that a change of wardrobe perhaps caused an uptick in sales: &ldquo;Peyton&rsquo;s second Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos sold more jerseys than his second big game with the Colts. But, Indianapolis fans in 2010 paid more &ndash; $37.76 on average &ndash; than their Denver counterparts &ndash; average of $31.36.&rdquo;\r\n<ul><li>The Dab Dominates &ndash; As the report states, Panthers gear trailed Broncos gear on eBay until Week 6. The reason is as simple as a nifty celebration dance. Cam Newton unveiled his version of the Dab and the rest is commerce history: &ldquo;After that game, sales of Carolina merchandise started to spike, and quickly closed the gap against the Broncos&rsquo; lead.&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>All QB Love: It&rsquo;s true that most of the top jersey sales belong to quarterbacks. However, there is one notable outlier: &ldquo;On eBay, quarterback jerseys sell better than other positions. But, in 2013, the Baltimore Ravens quarterback, Joe Flacco, wasn&rsquo;t as popular as the Ravens&rsquo; Ray Lewis, who retired following his championship win and who ranks fourth on the jersey list.&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>Halftime Bits Of Tid &ndash; It may just be a banner year for merchandise representing halftime performers. As the report states, there is a sizable increase in items sold relating to whoever takes center stage.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/super-bowl/6859537/bruno-mars-coldplay-beyonce-super-bowl-50-halftime-show\" target=\"_blank\">As noted</a>, Bruno Mars and Beyonce will join Coldplay in the much-publicized show. And speaking of Mars: &ldquo;Bruno Mars made the biggest impact, jumping 244% in bought items the week after his performance (2014) compared to the week before.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul><strong>PREDICTIONS</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd there are of course some things to glean from all the data. Now we leave it to you if you want to forego offensive metrics and defensive prowess for purchasing power.\r\n\r\nHowever, eBay relayed to me that there are some correlations to previous purchases: &ldquo;One trend that eBay has found is that before a team wins its first Super Bowl, sales on eBay jump significantly compared to their competitor. Seattle fans bought 34 percent more gear than Broncos fans before their upset in 2014 for their first Super Bowl win. Similarly, Saints fans bought 114 percent more gear than Colts fans ahead of their first Super Bowl championship in franchise history in 2009.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIf you were wondering, the Broncos have the edge at the moment, but things are extremely fluid. If you want an updated list of trends, then visit <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/trending\">eBay&rsquo;s link</a> to monitor how purchases are going leading up to the Super Bowl.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, it makes a great deal of sense. We are a nation of bandwagoners. (Maybe that&rsquo;s just my fellow Los Angeles natives and me.) Those without loyalty may be slowly gobbling up the jerseys of that team they think will actually win, consciously or not.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the nation has Super Bowl fever. Expect that to continue well after Sunday when items fly off the virtual shelf thanks to millions watching athletes and performers deliver the best show of the year.","description":"Super Bowl is here and eBay celebrates with a deep dive into the business behind the game.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1fd5bf51669b4f079d30c57c2943942c/960x0.jpg?fit=scale","imageHeight":625,"imageWidth":960,"type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gabezaldivar/2016/02/02/ebay-unveils-wealth-of-super-bowl-data-and-predictions/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"3807","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1748120","name":"Gabe Zaldivar","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c031c1be9ae3fd9327b442a2a54a1f?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c031c1be9ae3fd9327b442a2a54a1f?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c031c1be9ae3fd9327b442a2a54a1f?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c031c1be9ae3fd9327b442a2a54a1f?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gabezaldivar/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/gabezalforbes/","twitterName":"gabezal","authorType":"individual","email":"gabezal@yahoo.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"Covering sports with pop-culture tinted goggles.","timestamp":1455410429025,"description":"Born and raised in West Covina, I have always been a hop, skip and a carpool away from Dodger Stadium where I nurtured a passion for sports and sports futility.

can see it in the crates of avocados leaving Costco this week, in the massive amount of beer that will be consumed. You can witness its arrival with the friendly wagers between pals that are being conducted en masse. Perhaps, however, there is no more intriguing way to enjoy Super Bowl’s arrival than diving through all the lovely data found in myriad eBay purchases in a report titled <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/the-business-of-the-big-game/\" target=\"_blank\">The Business of the Big Game</a>.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what the online marketplace has given we football fans just days before Lady Gaga belts out the National Anthem, signaling the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers’ turn to take center stage.</p>\n<p>In a captivating post on Tuesday, eBay unveiled a deluge of data as pertains to the big game, even going so far as offering up some predictions as to the winner.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1fd5bf51669b4f079d30c57c2943942c\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-1fd5bf51669b4f079d30c57c2943942c\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1fd5bf51669b4f079d30c57c2943942c/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Vince Lombardi Trophy is displayed inside the NFL Experience Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016, in San Francisco. The Denver Broncos will play the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 Sunday, Feb. 7, 2016. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)</p> \n</div>\n<p>That’s right. In time you will have the skinny on which team to place that bet on thanks to the way consumer demands are swaying.</p>\n<p>Now the most striking image is eBay’s visual representation of where the nation is situated as far as team specific purchases.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>The following image represents items purchased from July 22, 2015 to January 27, 2016:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_324\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-324\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gabezaldivar/files/2016/02/Screen-shot-2016-02-02-at-4.56.27-PM3-e1454461314233.png\" alt=\"Image courtesy eBay. \" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy eBay.</p> \n</div>\n<p>As the report states, Broncos-specific purchases are indeed spread across a wide swath of the nation. However, Panthers fans are most definitely getting prepared: “With orange areas dominating, Denver Broncos merchandise stands out, but don’t count the Panthers out just yet. The highest concentration of the heatmap’s 229,636 transactions are clustered in the Southeast.”</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Now the entire report is chockablock filled with juicy football tidbits. However we have our favorites as pertains to some of the sports biggest stars as well as the moment we all gather in the living room: Halftime.</p>\n<p>Here are just a few points that standout from this data purge.</p>\n<ul> \n <li>Jersey Superstar – Peyton Manning claims the top spot in jersey sales on eBay among all past Super Bowl players, something represented well in the following.</li> \n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_322\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-322\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gabezaldivar/files/2016/02/Screen-shot-2016-02-02-at-4.56.34-PM1.png\" alt=\"Image courtesy eBay. \" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy eBay.</p> \n</div>\n<p>The report continues that a change of wardrobe perhaps caused an uptick in sales: “Peyton’s second Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos sold more jerseys than his second big game with the Colts. But, Indianapolis fans in 2010 paid more – $37.76 on average – than their Denver counterparts – average of $31.36.”</p>\n<ul> \n <li>The Dab Dominates – As the report states, Panthers gear trailed Broncos gear on eBay until Week 6. The reason is as simple as a nifty celebration dance. Cam Newton unveiled his version of the Dab and the rest is commerce history: “After that game, sales of Carolina merchandise started to spike, and quickly closed the gap against the Broncos’ lead.”</li> \n <li>All QB Love: It’s true that most of the top jersey sales belong to quarterbacks. However, there is one notable outlier: “On eBay, quarterback jerseys sell better than other positions. But, in 2013, the Baltimore Ravens quarterback, Joe Flacco, wasn’t as popular as the Ravens’ Ray Lewis, who retired following his championship win and who ranks fourth on the jersey list.”</li> \n <li>Halftime Bits Of Tid – It may just be a banner year for merchandise representing halftime performers. As the report states, there is a sizable increase in items sold relating to whoever takes center stage.</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/super-bowl/6859537/bruno-mars-coldplay-beyonce-super-bowl-50-halftime-show\" target=\"_blank\">As noted</a>, Bruno Mars and Beyonce will join Coldplay in the much-publicized show. And speaking of Mars: “Bruno Mars made the biggest impact, jumping 244% in bought items the week after his performance (2014) compared to the week before.”</li> \n</ul>\n<p><strong>PREDICTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>And there are of course some things to glean from all the data. Now we leave it to you if you want to forego offensive metrics and defensive prowess for purchasing power.</p>\n<p>However, eBay relayed to me that there are some correlations to previous purchases: “One trend that eBay has found is that before a team wins its first Super Bowl, sales on eBay jump significantly compared to their competitor. Seattle fans bought 34 percent more gear than Broncos fans before their upset in 2014 for their first Super Bowl win. Similarly, Saints fans bought 114 percent more gear than Colts fans ahead of their first Super Bowl championship in franchise history in 2009.”</p>\n<p>If you were wondering, the Broncos have the edge at the moment, but things are extremely fluid. If you want an updated list of trends, then visit <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/trending\">eBay’s link</a> to monitor how purchases are going leading up to the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>If you think about it, it makes a great deal of sense. We are a nation of bandwagoners. (Maybe that’s just my fellow Los Angeles natives and me.) Those without loyalty may be slowly gobbling up the jerseys of that team they think will actually win, consciously or not.</p>\n<p>In any case, the nation has Super Bowl fever. Expect that to continue well after Sunday when items fly off the virtual shelf thanks to millions watching athletes and performers deliver the best show of the year.</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_5","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"SportsMoney","url":"/sportsmoney"}],"pTagCount":25,"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1748120","name":"Gabe Zaldivar","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c031c1be9ae3fd9327b442a2a54a1f?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c031c1be9ae3fd9327b442a2a54a1f?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c031c1be9ae3fd9327b442a2a54a1f?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a7c031c1be9ae3fd9327b442a2a54a1f?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gabezaldivar/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/gabezalforbes/","twitterName":"gabezal","authorType":"individual","email":"gabezal@yahoo.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"Covering sports with pop-culture tinted goggles.","timestamp":1455410429025,"description":"Born and raised in West Covina, I have always been a hop, skip and a carpool away from Dodger Stadium where I nurtured a passion for sports and sports futility.
