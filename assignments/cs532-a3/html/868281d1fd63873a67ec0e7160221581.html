Brands are wheeling out their sharpest creative strategies and top celebrity talent to make sure that the the $166,666 per second that they are shelling out for ad time (that&rsquo;s $5 million for a 30-second spot) not only buys them eyeballs, but earns them clicks and social traffic far beyond the living room.\r\n\r\n<strong>Advertisers are not waiting for kickoff. </strong>The Super Bowl ad battle has already begun. According to the metrics firm <a href=\"http://ispot.tv/\">iSpot.tv</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2016/02/07/these-new-data-tools-are-helping-tv-watch-back/#6956864a2374\">tracks the performance and value of television ads</a> across the media spectrum:\r\n</p><ul><li>Even the week before kickoff, brands spent an estimated<strong> $11.96 million</strong> on 2,984 Super bowl spots running in markets nationwide.</li>\r\n\t<li>Paid and earned television airings of Super Bowl ads and teasers have amassed <strong>353 million TV impressions, </strong>with Bud Light leading the pack at 85.4 million.</li>\r\n\t<li>Online, <strong>50 brands and 84 teasers have amassed over 373.8 million digital views, </strong>including 178 million from Facebook.</li>\r\n\t<li>Of the remaining 195.8 million, over half, or <strong>105 million</strong>, were organic (unpaid) views on YouTube.</li>\r\n\t<li>Over the past 48 hours, social activity around Super Bowl ads spiked <strong>3 million social actions</strong> across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (likes, comments, tweets, shares, etc). That is a jump of nearly 2 million since Friday.</li>\r\n</ul><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Who&rsquo;s leading the pack?</strong> Nearly 80 Super Bowl spots, teasers and previews have already been released prior to the game, trying to generate buzz and social impressions. Here&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ve stacked up so far.\r\n<ul><li><strong>Pokemon&rsquo;s</strong> extended spot &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AtHG/pokemon-super-bowl-2016-extended-pokemon-20\">Pokemon 20</a>&rdquo; leads the pack, racking up nearly 15 million online views and upwards of 350,000 social actions, good for a 19% digital share of voice.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Hyundai&rsquo;s</strong> &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AOR6/2016-hyundai-genesis-super-bowl-2016-first-date-feat-kevin-hart\">First Date</a>&rdquo; spot featuring Kevin Hart comes in second at an 11% share, with 8.4M online views. Another Hyundai spot, &ldquo;Ryanville&rdquo; (for its Elantra model) also cracked the top five with over 7 million online views. Added up, that gives the Hyundai brand a 17% share of voice.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Heinz</strong> is close behind with &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AO1F/heinz-ketchup-super-bowl-2016-extended-wiener-stampede\">Weiner Stampede</a>,&rdquo; garnering just about 4 million online views, 200K social actions and a 9.4% share.</li>\r\n\t<li>Of the 15 ads and teasers that have aired during commercial breaks, <strong>Wix&rsquo;s</strong><a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/a/AOlb\"><span></span>&ldquo;Kung Fu Panda Discovers the Power of Wix&rdquo;</a><span>&nbsp;teaser has the highest average view rate at 96.7%.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[youtubevid id=\"2F46tGehnfo\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Ones to Watch.</strong> A bunch of other spots and previews that have been released so far have serious social potential based on their creative approaches, wry uses of celebrity talent or just general weirdness. A couple of standouts include:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Squarespace&rsquo;s</strong> campaign featuring surreal non-sequitur game commentary from hipsters Lee and Morris (actors Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele).</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Doritos </strong>is offering its traditional barrage of ads, but I&rsquo;ll bet its &ldquo;Crash the Super Bowl&rdquo; finalist spot &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AnIi/AnIi\">Ultrasound</a>&rdquo; draws plenty of comment.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Avocados from Mexico</strong> serves up a fast-paced, science fiction-oriented spot called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AO1H/AO1H\">Avos in Space</a>,&rdquo; full of sight gags and snappy dialogue, plus a rare Scott Baio sighting.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Bud Light </strong>casts regal actress Helen Miren a little bit against type to offer some straight talk about drunken driving in &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AOg7/AOg7\">Give a Damn</a>.&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>It&rsquo;s possible that the host of this whole shindig, the <strong>NFL</strong>, has upstaged its guests with its musical tribute to <a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AOSS/nfl-super-bowl-2016-extended-super-bowl-babies-choir-feat-seal\">Super Bowl babies</a>, featuring Seal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KqekigARfE\r\n\r\nThese are some of the early hits so far, but as we know, there will be plenty of surprises when the Big Game airs. I&rsquo;ll be <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2016/02/07/whos-winning-the-super-bowl-ad-battle-live-blogging-the-big-game-with-real-time-data/#2c916bad44c6\">live-blogging</a> and tweeting (@robsalk) the commercials during the game, with exclusive metrics on how they&rsquo;re landing on social media.

Brands are wheeling out their sharpest creative strategies and top celebrity talent to make sure that the the $166,666 per second that they are shelling out for ad time (that’s $5 million for a 30-second spot) not only buys them eyeballs, but earns them clicks and social traffic far beyond the living room.</p>\n<p><strong>Advertisers are not waiting for kickoff. </strong>The Super Bowl ad battle has already begun. According to the metrics firm <a href=\"http://ispot.tv/\">iSpot.tv</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2016/02/07/these-new-data-tools-are-helping-tv-watch-back/#6956864a2374\" target=\"_self\">tracks the performance and value of television ads</a> across the media spectrum:</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p></p>\n<ul> \n <li>Even the week before kickoff, brands spent an estimated<strong> $11.96 million</strong> on 2,984 Super bowl spots running in markets nationwide.</li> \n <li>Paid and earned television airings of Super Bowl ads and teasers have amassed <strong>353 million TV impressions, </strong>with Bud Light leading the pack at 85.4 million.</li> \n <li>Online, <strong>50 brands and 84 teasers have amassed over 373.8 million digital views, </strong>including 178 million from Facebook.</li> \n <li>Of the remaining 195.8 million, over half, or <strong>105 million</strong>, were organic (unpaid) views on YouTube.</li> \n <div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div> \n <li>Over the past 48 hours, social activity around Super Bowl ads spiked <strong>3 million social actions</strong> across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (likes, comments, tweets, shares, etc). That is a jump of nearly 2 million since Friday.</li> \n</ul>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Who’s leading the pack?</strong> Nearly 80 Super Bowl spots, teasers and previews have already been released prior to the game, trying to generate buzz and social impressions. Here’s how they’ve stacked up so far.</p>\n<ul> \n <li><strong>Pokemon’s</strong> extended spot “<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AtHG/pokemon-super-bowl-2016-extended-pokemon-20\">Pokemon 20</a>” leads the pack, racking up nearly 15 million online views and upwards of 350,000 social actions, good for a 19% digital share of voice.</li> \n <li><strong>Hyundai’s</strong> “<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AOR6/2016-hyundai-genesis-super-bowl-2016-first-date-feat-kevin-hart\">First Date</a>” spot featuring Kevin Hart comes in second at an 11% share, with 8.4M online views. Another Hyundai spot, “Ryanville” (for its Elantra model) also cracked the top five with over 7 million online views. Added up, that gives the Hyundai brand a 17% share of voice.</li> \n <li><strong>Heinz</strong> is close behind with “<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AO1F/heinz-ketchup-super-bowl-2016-extended-wiener-stampede\">Weiner Stampede</a>,” garnering just about 4 million online views, 200K social actions and a 9.4% share.</li> \n <li>Of the 15 ads and teasers that have aired during commercial breaks, <strong>Wix’s</strong><a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/a/AOlb\"><span></span>“Kung Fu Panda Discovers the Power of Wix”</a><span>&nbsp;teaser has the highest average view rate at 96.7%.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></li> \n</ul>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\"> \n <iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2F46tGehnfo\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</div>\n<p><strong>Ones to Watch.</strong> A bunch of other spots and previews that have been released so far have serious social potential based on their creative approaches, wry uses of celebrity talent or just general weirdness. A couple of standouts include:</p>\n<ul> \n <li><strong>Squarespace’s</strong> campaign featuring surreal non-sequitur game commentary from hipsters Lee and Morris (actors Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele).</li> \n <li><strong>Doritos </strong>is offering its traditional barrage of ads, but I’ll bet its “Crash the Super Bowl” finalist spot “<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AnIi/AnIi\">Ultrasound</a>” draws plenty of comment.</li> \n <li><strong>Avocados from Mexico</strong> serves up a fast-paced, science fiction-oriented spot called “<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AO1H/AO1H\">Avos in Space</a>,” full of sight gags and snappy dialogue, plus a rare Scott Baio sighting.</li> \n <li><strong>Bud Light </strong>casts regal actress Helen Miren a little bit against type to offer some straight talk about drunken driving in “<a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AOg7/AOg7\">Give a Damn</a>.”</li> \n <li>It’s possible that the host of this whole shindig, the <strong>NFL</strong>, has upstaged its guests with its musical tribute to <a href=\"http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AOSS/nfl-super-bowl-2016-extended-super-bowl-babies-choir-feat-seal\">Super Bowl babies</a>, featuring Seal.</li> \n</ul>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KqekigARfE</p>\n<p>These are some of the early hits so far, but as we know, there will be plenty of surprises when the Big Game airs.
