presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders started the MSNBC debate in Durham NH sparring over foreign policy and campaign finance reform but ended the night on a friendly note Sarah ParnassThe Washington Post   Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders squared off in the fifth Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire on Thursday night I watched and picked some of the best and worst of the night Winners  Hillary Clinton This was not a debate in which Clinton scored a knockout blow It was one however that she won on points Clinton came out super aggressive in the debates first 30 minutes pushing Sanders back on his heels on well everything guns experience the tenor of the campaign what it means to be progressive and plenty of other things There are those who will see Clintons tone in those first 30 minutes as over the top and therefore ineffective but it seemed to me that she set up lots and lots of attacks that she can follow through on beyond New Hampshire Clinton made clear at least to my eyes  that she understands the New Hampshire primary is a lost cause More on that below When the subject moved to foreign policy in the debates second hour Clinton was clearly more at ease than Sanders and effectively made the case that now isnt the time to put someone in the Oval Office who needs to learn on the job It was far from a perfect debate for Clinton She struggled again to explain the speaking fees she took as a private citizen and pointedly refused the opportunity to release the transcripts of those speeches Her response or lack thereof ensures the issue will linger      Twoperson debates Theres a reason that networks try to limit the number of people on stage during these debates This debate  the first oneonone showdown of the 2016 primary season  proved that less is more in debates The first hour was the best hour of any debate of this election substantive confrontational and entertaining Both candidates had plenty of time to make their cases to voters and more importantly voters had a chance to get a deep look at what these two people believe and where they differ  Split screens I am on the record as wanting a channel  online would be fine  that runs a split screen the entire time when the candidates are talking If the NFL can have 20 different camera angles to watch every play why cant I have this one little thing I mean if we could have more of this why wouldnt you want it   Chuck ToddRachel Maddow Moderating a debate for state Senate is hard Moderating a presidential debate is really tough Todd and Maddow did the thing that is both hardest and best for moderators at this level They let the candidates actually debate There is nothing that drives me crazier than when a moderator steps into the middle of a genuine conversationdisagreement between two or more candidates in order to move on to some other topic The whole point of a debate is to figure out where the differences are and how each candidate explains those differences not to try to see who can ask the most questions Todd and Maddow got out of the way of the candidates tonight which is exactly what good moderators should do Also kudos to the duo for asking thoughtful questions that havent been asked of the candidates a thousand times before Toddsquestion to Sanders about why he wasnt taking public financing for the primary campaign was an A Losers  Bernie Sanders I hesitate to put the Vermont socialist in the loser category because he did very little in the debate that will slow his momentum heading into a nearcertain New Hampshire win But I also hate when analysts and reporters take the easy way out when picking winners and losers It was a twoperson debate if Clinton won then Sanders by definition didnt win This is the problem with using the binary choice of winner and loser to grade debates But I digress I thought Sanders was forceful and effective as always when talking about economic inequality and campaign finance reform I thought he may have allowed himself to be put in a box as a single or doubleissue candidate down the line by Clinton however Sanders also continued to struggle when the debate moved off of domestic issues and onto matters of foreign policy On a question about what the right next steps were regarding American troops in Afghanistan Sanderss answer was rambling and generally nonsensical      New Hampshire Clinton pledged repeatedly to fight for every vote in New Hampshire But if you read between the lines of some of her statements it was clear that she understands that the Granite State primary is probably already over Her first big attack on Sanders was on his alleged lack of commitment to gun control including votes against the Brady Bill That attack wont play well in New Hampshire a Second Amendmentfriendly state and Clinton knows it But she also knows that among Democrats nationally being the candidate regarded as more liberal on gun control is a good place to be Clintons decision to travel to Flint Mich  announced just before the debate  just 48 hours before the New Hampshire vote is another signal that she has her eye beyond the Granite State already New Hampshire which fashions itself the picker of presidents or at least presidential nominees almost certainly wont get the attention it has in past primary fights  Democratic National Committee Remind me again why a there werent more debates on the primary calendar initially and b those that were scheduled were put at times when no one would watch them  Time I initially had the 90minute debate length in the winners column because that felt like plenty of time for the two candidates to hash out their differences and for us all to go to bed at a reasonable hour I moved it to the losers column when the debate went beyond its scheduled 1030 pm Eastern end time Then past 1045 pm Then past 11 pm Come on man What we doing out there man   Chris Cillizza writes The Fix a
