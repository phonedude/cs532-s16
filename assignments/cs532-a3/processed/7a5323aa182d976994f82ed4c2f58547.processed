        As many as a million fans in Denver orange and Carolina blue are expected to descend on the Bay Area this weekend for the Super Bowl Of those some 70 thousand of the luckiest wealthiest and best connected will get to watch the game from inside the stateoftheart Levis Stadium in Santa ClaraCompleted in 2014 the stadium lives up to the reputation of its Silicon Valley home Crammed full of networking equipment and 400 miles of fiberoptic cable it was built with an outsize capacity for supporting Internetconnected devices Underneath the stadium seats 1300 wifi access points broadcast a free wireless network to the assembled fans who are never more than 10 feet from a node The entire arena can handle a traffic load thats four times higher than NFLs minimum standard for football stadiumsThe stadiums connectivity is aimed at solving a problem that is increasingly plaguing older venues During wellattended games cell and wireless networks can easily get clogged up when too many fans tweet post photos and stream video all at once The networks built into Levis Stadium are designed to banish this modern nightmarebut their sheer scale makes the stadium an attractive target for cyberattacksWhenever tens of thousands of devices are crammed onto one public wifi network there will always be security risks But add to the mix the highprofile nature of the Super Bowlan event that consistently earns a toppriority security response from federal law enforcementand there is a real cause for worryThe heightened concern stems in part from the kinds of people that generally attend the big game says Carl Herberger the vice president for security at Radware an Israelbased cybersecurity company The stadium is likely to be packed with wealthy corporate executives and sponsors politicians and celebrities many of whom carry around mobile devices brimming with sensitive information and valuable contactsHerberger estimates that between fans mobile devices and the stadiums builtin connections there will be somewhere around 100000 devices connected to the stadium this weekend In one potential attack hackers could infiltrate attendees phones through a security hole in stadium infrastructureits wifi network for example or its official app By infecting a large group of devices the hacker could establish a botnet a network of connected devices that work together to complete largerscale attacks like sending spam or flooding a server with requests in a denialofservice attack The huge network becomes a gigantic single point of failure like the Death Star for a bot Herberger said Its a nice juicy target to conscribe into your botted armyKnowing the stadiums hardware and software setup could help hackers tailor an attack to the vulnerabilities in a specific productShort of establishing a botnet hackers could fool stadiumgoers into connecting to the wrong wifi network This is a popular trick in airports An open free wireless network with an innocuoussounding name entices people to connect But once theyre on the network a maninthemiddle attack can intercept unencrypted web traffic or inject malicious code and infect the connected deviceHackers can also use the same eviltwin approach to mimic a cell tower rather than a wireless router Many lawenforcement agencies use these devices often called Stingrays to scan and find a target cell phone in a populated area Deployed by a hacker a cellsite simulator could allow for maninthemiddle attacks through a devices mobile data connectionSome companies have publicized the fact that they supplied Levis Stadium with networking equipment and infrastructure Herberger noted To be honest I think thats a bit disturbing he said Knowing the stadiums hardware and software setup could help hackers tailor an attack to the vulnerabilities in a specific productLaw enforcement hasnt shared the specific cybersecurity precautions in place in Santa Clara and the NFL would not comment on its security plan But the area is preparing for every eventuality To secure the stadium from attacks the NFL is collaborating with the Department of Homeland Security which has designated every Super Bowl since 2001 a nationalsecurity special event unlocking extra resources personnel and surveillance equipment Hundreds of federal agents from agencies like the Transportation Security Administration Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard will pitch in a DHS spokesperson saidStadiums vulnerability to technology glitches was on display as recently as last week when the Microsoft tablets on the New England Patriots sideline stopped working midgame Teams use the tablets to review photos of recent plays but a network cable malfunction rendered the Patriots technology inoperable for part of the first half of the AFC Championship game according to the NFLMuch more worrying the 2013 Super Bowl was delayed for more than 30 minutes just after halftime after the power went out in parts of the New Orleans Superdome The blackout was caused by a malfunction in a device that was monitoring the electrical load to the the stadium According to the manufacturer the device sensed an abnormality and shut down the powerIn the runup to this years Super Bowl the FBI is investigating a spate of attacks on fiberoptic cables in the Bay Area In an internal memo obtained by NBC Washington officials wondered if the pattern of severed cables could be part of a more complex plot but said that there are no specific credible threats against the Super BowlIf youre one of the bigwigs or highrollers attending the game how can you keep your own devices safe Make sure youre connecting to the authentic stadium wifi and not a malicious knockoffor better yet avoid wifi in favor of generally more secure mobile data Installing a virtual private network can help keep more sensitive information safeBut the best thing to do is use your device as little as possible and disconnect from networks unless youre using them Consider everything public Herberger said If youre afraid of seeing it on The New York Times then dont do it

            The sudden death of Antonin Scalia an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on Saturday morning will shake up American politics like few events in recent memory reshaping the 2016 presidential campaign and potentially leaving the Supreme Court deadlocked for more than a year13

            On a sultry evening last July a tall softspoken 17yearold named David Stoner and nearly 600 other math whizzes from all over the world sat huddled in small groups around wicker bistro tables talking in low voices and obsessively refreshing the browsers on their laptops The air in the cavernous lobby of the Lotus Hotel Pang Suan Kaew in Chiang Mai Thailand was humid recalls Stoner whose light South Carolina accent warms his carefully chosen words The tension in the room made it seem especially heavy like the atmosphere at a highstakes poker tournament13

            March was a hugely important month for religion and the Supreme Court and a pivotal moment for Justice Antonin Scalia the subject of a fat new biography Too bad we couldnx2019t talk plainly about what was and is at stake In a country historically averse to political debates about competing faiths nowhere is frank discussion of religion more taboo than at the US Supreme Court x201CReligion is the third rail of Supreme Court politics Itx2019s not something thatx2019s talked about in polite companyx201D as Jeff Shesol the author of a book about the New Deal Court put it He was speaking with NPRx2019s Nina Totenberg in 2010 when John Paul Stevens was looking at retirement and for the first time in American history there was the prospect of six Catholics three Jews and no Protestants on the highest court in the landx2014a watershed almost too x201Cradioactivex201D Totenberg remarked even to note And beware of venturing any further than that as the University of Chicago Law Schoolx2019s Geoffrey Stone did in a controversial 2007 blog post suggesting that the Supreme Courtx2019s five conservatives likely derived their abortion views from Catholic doctrine Scaliax2014a devout Catholic and the current Courtx2019s longestserving conservativex2014announced a boycott of the school until Stone leaves the faculty13

x201CAnticolonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decadesx201D Andreessen wrote x201CWhy stop nowx201D13

After that the Internet went nuts13

Andreessen deleted his tweet apologized and underscored that he is x201C100 percent opposed to colonialismx201D and x201C100 percent in favor of independence and freedomx201D Zuckerberg Facebookx2019s CEO followed up with his own Facebook post to say Andreessenx2019s comment was x201Cdeeply upsettingx201D to him and not representative of the way he thinks x201Cat allx201D13

        Einsteinrsquos gravitational waves rest on a genuinely radical idea
        
        
            After decades of anticipation we have directly detected gravitational wavesx2014ripples in spacetime traveling at the speed of light through the universe Scientists at LIGO the Laser Interferometic Gravitationalwave Observatory have announced that they have measured waves coming from the inspiral of two massive black holes providing a spectacular confirmation of Albert Einsteinx2019s general theory of relativity whose hundredth anniversary was celebrated just last year13
13
Finding gravitational waves indicates that Einstein was once again right and opens a new window onto energetic events occurring around the universe But therex2019s a deeper lesson as well a reminder of the central importance of locality an idea that underlies much of modern physics13

            I am one of the 10 million people who acquired an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus ten days ago13

Coming from Planet Android I wasnx2019t as put off by the larger dimensions as everyone else in the technosphere seemed to be But I was as usual put off by one thing that both the Apple product and its archnemesis from Google shared the unpocketability of the phone particularly by females13
13
This isnx2019t a new problem for women Our skinny jeans have pockets but there is no way an object bigger than a standard issue ID card fits in the front and everyone knows that slipping a phone in your back pocket is an invitation for a treacherous dive into a toilet or a backflip resulting in heartbreaking shatters Purses have enclosures that were once suitable for the flip phone generation but have since become too snug for newer models Throwing it into the main compartment seems risky at best13

        Meryl Streep explained her allwhite filmfestival jury by claiming that ldquowersquore all Africans reallyrdquo Shersquos right and so wrong
        
        
            Meryl Streep at the Berlin film festival this week was asked whyx2014given OscarsSoWhite given that itx2019s 2016 given that come onx2014she had convened an allwhite panel to judge this yearx2019s festival entrants Invoking the rhetoric of an American president who had visited Berlin in the course of the last century Streep dismissed objections to her panelx2019s monochromism x201CThe thing that I notice is that there is a core of humanity that travels right through every culturex201D she said x201CAnd after all wex2019re all from Africa originally you know Wex2019re all Berliners wex2019re all Africans reallyx201D13

This wasnx2019t terribly surprising When Streep was asked last year in the course of promoting her extremely feminist film Suffragette whether she is herself a feminist the actor replied that no she isnx2019t Instead x201CI am a humanistx201D she said x201CI am for nice easy balancex201D 13

            As it stands the international coalition is far from winning the information war against the Islamic State Its air strikes may be squeezing the group in Iraq and Syria and killing many of its leaders but that has not halted the selfproclaimed caliphatex2019s ideological momentum Indeed at the end of 2015 it was estimated that the number of foreigners travelling to join militant groups in Iraq and Syriax2014predominantly the Islamic Statex2014had more than doubled in the course of just 18 months Whatx2019s more while these figures may be striking sheer numbers are less important than intent when it comes to the organizationx2019s actual threat to the world As we have already seen it takes a very small number of people to unleash great terror whether in Iraq Syria or elsewhere13

        Ben Stillerrsquos followup to his own comedy classic is a downright bummer no matter how many celebrity cameos it tries to cram in
        
        
            You donx2019t need to go to the theater to get the full experience of Zoolander 2 Simply get your hands on a copy of the original watch it and then yell a bunch of unfunny topical lines every time somebody tells a joke Thatx2019s how it feels to watch Ben Stillerx2019s sequel to his 2001 spoof of the fashion industry Zoolander 2 takes pains to reference every successful gag you remember from the original and then embellish them in painfulx2014often offensive almost always outdatedx2014fashion Itx2019s a film that has no real reason to exist and it spends its entire running time reaffirming that fact13
13
13
The original Zoolander to be fair had no business being as funny as it wasx2014it made fun of an industry that already seems to exist in a constant state of selfparody and much of its humor relied on simple malapropisms and sight gags But it was hilarious anyway as a candid snapshot of the fizzlingout of x201990s culture Like almost any zeitgeist comedy it belonged to a particular momentx2014and boy should it have stayed there With Zoolander 2 Stiller who directed cowrote and stars tries to recapture the magic of 2001 by referencing its past glories with increasing desperation perhaps to avoid the fact that he has nothing new to say about the fashion industry or celebrity culture 15 years laters13

13
Many people in this world would find my behavior rather strange Thatx2019s because Americans are exceptionally promiscuous when it comes to professing their love In the United States x201CI love youx201D is at once exalted and devalued It can mean everything  or nothing at all This is not universally the case13
