			TheSaint Laurent New York Fashion Week FallWinter 2016 runway fashion show started with a bang or rather a light show emanating from these architectural portals which lifted up to allow models decked out in glam rock retro looks to walk onto the runway Velvet leather ascot cravats and puffties gold embroidered vests dot shirts lace collars sequins zebra and leopard animal prints suede coats lam silk shirts and wide brimmed hats set the tone for this edgy chic fashion show It8217s everything I8217ve been saying I want fashion to exude for years now it8217sInterview with the Vampire meets rock gods
The Saint Laurent NYFW FW16 collection is ontrend borrowing aspects from retro influences of the 708217s 908217s and periods of a nostalgic time gone by with the styling including the use of the ties and collars It was a rockerchic vampy dark and mysterious show one which embodied the effortless style of rock stars from various eras

			Nicholas K New York Fashion Week FallWinter 2016 runway show looks like a goth pirate Gypsy ship docked backstage Black looks kimono belts long and mini fingerless gloves headbands and scarves asymmetry satin dresses contrast paneled leather pants black on black leather shearling jackets long velvet coats an amazing shirt collar skirt tied with the sleeves and capes strut the runway
The color palette begins in all black then transitions to gray and white with textile prints as shown on the poncho and tunic worn over matching or contrasting shirts and finally segues to graypurple and purples browns and taupe and deep wines The white off the shoulder dress gave us Marilyn Manson when paired with the dark berry lip bold brows and nude ruddy eyemakeup and black manicure I8217mangry that the holster bags are my idea and Nicholas K got to it first but they8217re very cool nonetheless Who isn8217t craving velvet and crushed velvet right now I love the way the sleeved taper in at the wrist and turn into fingerless gloves and how cool is the arm armor
The Nicholas K NYFW FW16 girlis a Gypsy Street Pirate bringing bad ass to a neighborhood near you It8217s ontrend fashion forward as it is 908217s retro

			TheBCBG Max Azria New York Fashion Week FallWinter 2016Collection features experimentation with layering silhouette and construction while the sleeveless coats have me from the getgo some of the looks are bulky So long as the natural waist is cinched it worked but when garments are piled on top of one another it just looks baglady The silhouettes work so long as they don8217t give this fat illusion which no one wants for example volume is played with on the sleeves while the kimono belting works to define the natural waist The color palette consists of white gray blues from light to navy black taupe golden rod beige burgundy and ruddy rusts with the slightest touch of pea green I actually love the way the strapped maxi dress looks over the body suit
The BCBG NYFW FW16 Collection is full of interesting silhouettes and looks although some should be restyled graded heavily and constructed differently for reallife consumers because if you make a model look fat8230it8217s not gonna make a real woman happy

			Celebs cover fitness mags accross the board Ryan Reynolds on Men8217s Health Kate Hudson on Self and Jaimie Alexander on Shape Stars known for their bodies fitness health and diet often cover fitness magazines more than fitness gurus and models Studies show people trust attractive people and because these are familiar faces of presumed healthy people it makes marketing sense Reynolds has the new Deadpool movie out furthering his marketing appeal Hudson has her Fabletics athletics brand which sort of goes hand in hand with the athleisure influence on style and fashion I tried to shop Fabletics and personally found it frustrating I had to switch to a different device because of the UI by that time I was not impressed and not having it Alexander8217s cover boasts a 10min workout let us just reminisce on her amazing Globes slowmotion red carpet video this woman needs to be discovered as the face of a house or brand stat
Kate Hudon8217s Diet and Fitness NonRoutine Routine

Kate Hudson really does have a great body and is known for fitness moreso since her Fabletics launch I feel In Shape Magazine she8217s quoted as saying 8220I8217m finally at a place in my life where if someone wants to know what I do to stay healthy why not tell them8221 She8217s released a new lifestyle book Pretty Happy Healthy Ways to Love Your Body We8217ve seen the adventurous side of Kate onRunning Wild with Bear Grylls in which she scaled down a mountain suspended from a piece of ice In the article Hudson says that she switches up her routine and that change is the only constant in her health and fitness regimen She cites Tracy Anderson and Body by Simone and says she does everything from pilates to spinning and running I think one of the things we encounter most often is the nonmorning don8217t tell me to eat within an hour of getting up type8230of which I am one and so is Kate You must eat something anything have a shake within an hour of waking to boost your metabolism  She eats five small meals daily which is something I did when I lost 60lbs very quickly over 1lb per day including 8220a8230 protein shake 8230salad8230 and a lateafternoon snack before dinner8221 She says she8217s basically vegetarian indulges herself loves to dance is over the fads journals and has a relaxed attitude about diet and fitness sometimes taking a day off From my experience this is all true great advice and has worked for me I do feel like dance is an amazing workout and you know I8217m into pole fitness I do indulge myself don8217t believe in deprivation and also feel like you can allow yourself a break so you don8217t burnout I8217m over fad diets and just use a common sense healthy approach to diet or focus on caloric intake and proportions I also feel like journaling I use the My Diet Diary app helps you can get charts and percentages of your dietary intake exercise etc and it can help identify hidden trojan horses like the sugar and cream in your coffee or tea See my post on my fitness routine
Ryan Reynold8217s Greek God Bod Secrets
Reynolds has covered a few Men8217s Health magazines in the past and rightly so given the actor8217s evertoned physique 8220Even if I8217ve been in the gym for two hours before a 17hour day on a movie set I never bitch about it8221 he says inMen8217s Health 8220get your sleep when you get your sleep8221 This dad8217s dedication is why he8217s got the antidadbod He says he learned discipline from his dad who recently passed
While in high school he played football and says he really transformed his body for his role in Blade Trinity for which he worked out three hours a day and ate up to eight times per day He says his mood actually has a direct correlation to exercise and likes to go hiking bike and do warm upsandcalisthenics82308221I workout like aBritishperson8221 he says as he mentions jumpingjacks
Jaimie Alexander
 The Blindspot star reveals her 10minute workout8230822110 minute workout8221 you ask8230well believe it or not sometimes even a 1530 minute workout 3 times a week can change your life I8217ve certainly achieved my goals in such short workouts and was of course at my best when working out 5 times a week for hour sessions but everything in due time
InShape8216s March issue the star is described as chasing an oatmeal cookie with a bear before explaining that 8220Girly is a foreign concept8221 to her Alexander seems to be quite the tough girl having boxed with Chris Hemsworth wrestled in high school and done a pushup contest with Schwarzenegger She says her goal isn8217t to be super thin is basically a vegetarian sound familiar has burned 4k cals in a day and depends on craftservice hummus wraps She says she has a prison workout routine and does burpees sprintinterval basically periods of bursts of exercise then longer periods of rest and also shares this 8220obsession with Valslides by Valerie Waters8221 in addition to pikes lunges pushups TRX band jump rope in trailer swimming she trained with a SEAL for Blindspot and ab workouts She admits to a pizza weakness but says she8217s generally healthy except for a beer or bourbon here and there82308221I don8217t deprive myself8221 she says Amen sister I totally believe that deprivation as you8217ll hear me say time and again is the way to binging and going off your diet in a huge way
If you have ever tried a crazy strict diet you8217ll know what I mean I once tried this hospital diet I found online which was like 2 crackers for breakfast two crackers for lunch8230no I now have the knowledge to get my essential protein check the clock for when to eat yes I am that guy that forgets to eat but I8217m also someone who suffers from binge eating so cut me some slack and have learned not to try and snack but to depend on eating fulfilling meals to prevent binging I8217ve also learned to make latenight soups to further prevent the bingeeating and fill them with veggies so I8217m getting full but not gorging on calories

			McQ Men8217s FallWinter 2016 New York Fashion Week started off with thighhigh lace up boots atop leather pants paired with black tshirts blazers culottes leather vests and jackets and spearmint piped jumpsuits and boots The palette was mostly black with a touch of burgundy a black splattered cream jacket and bluewhitered blackyellow and blackwhite windowpane prints  The collection which seemed to be minimalist with leather boots took a rather sudden turn for the worse at the end with the random appearance of childsplay elastic waisted denim bold striped knits and windbreakers8230not cute
Overall McQ8217s NYFW MBFW FW16 presentation brought a wearable edgy minimalist vibe8230we8217ll just have to overlook the last looks which were juvenile and just wrong

			Nick Graham8217s Men8217s FallWinter 2016 New York Fashion Week presentation was a kitschy wacky freakshow In terms of styling there8217s no better way to take our eyes off the clothes Designers have learned to do something dumb to inspire talk8230Rick Owens for example and I hope that8217s what the intention was behind these birds and ducks tufts of grass evergreen branches tucked into and poking out of the looks8230which were not cute Bold or muddied juvenile plaidsgingham and windowpane prints met withgreens and browns gray red and blueThe Nick Graham FW16 NYFW presentation was a ridiculous mess and might have been more well received if not for the styling

			Jeffrey Rude Men8217s New York Fashion Week FallWinter 2016 collection was ontrend full of wearable separates and classic garments and for the most part impeccably tailored design not counting the hemlines although they seem to be trending amidst designers The only look I hated was the brown double breasted patch pocket blazer because it was a bit much Leather and velvet jackets and coats brown suede a yellow jacket we8217d gawk at if it wasn8217t ontrend with the 708217s and the expected shearling jacket all reared their heads in the Rude presentation
Jeffrey Rude FW16 NYFW was evocative of the 708217s classic style trendy yet fashionable As for future collections I hope to see the last name referenced perhaps a bit of edge a little more daring but otherwise a great collection
