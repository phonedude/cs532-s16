There are plenty of reasons to think the Panthers can win the franchises first Super Bowl

MORE Greatest Panthers of all timeJosh Norman isnt who you think he is
They have the NFLs MVP in quarterback Cam Newton one of the most consistent running games in the NFL an aggressive and opportunistic defense and a solid special teams unit
As long as the Panthers continue to play the way theyve performed all season they should be hoisting the Lombardi Trophy come Sunday night at Levis Stadium in Santa Clara Calif
Newton has the combination of size speed strength and savvy never before seen at the quarterback position The 65 245pound Georgia native threw for 3837 yards with 35 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions during the regular season while rushing for 636 yards and 10 scores Newton can become the first quarterback ever to win a college football national championship the Heisman Trophy NFL MVP and a Super Bowl title He would join Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen as the only players at any position to achieve all four feats Allen was also the MVP of Super BowlXVIII and Newton would be a favorite to be the Super Bowl 50 MVP
Newtons counterpart 18year veteran and fivetime NFL MVP Peyton Manning will have to contend with a Panthers defense that finished sixth in total defense and was fourth against the run The Panthers were also sixth in sacks the Broncos were first and do a great job of collapsing the pocket because of defensive tackle Kawann Short who led the team with 11 sacks
Behind Short are Pro Bowl linebackers Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly who was the 2013 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Both Davis and Kuechly recorded more than 100 tackles for the fourth straight season The Panthers also have depth at linebacker winning all three games without Kuechly after he suffered a concussion in the regularseason opener
MORE Cam Newton quiz Are you a lover or a hater How the Panthers were built in 10 steps
Manning has thrown 17 interceptions in only 10 games this season and the Panthers led the NFL by a large margin with a plus20 turnover ratio The Panthers had 24 interceptions during the regular season led by safety Kurt Colemans seven Kuechly Davis and shutdown corner Josh Norman had four picks apiece Coleman and Kuechly have interceptions in the postseason and Kuechly has returned half of his six total picks for touchdowns including one in each playoff game The Panthers have playmakers at each level one of the reasons the Broncos may have difficulty moving the ball
The Panthers jumped out to huge leads in wins over the Seahawks and Cardinals but even if they fall behind they might be the most resilient team in the NFL Despite losing leading receiver Kelvin Benjamin in the training camp 2014 sacks leader Charles Johnson for nine weeksand cornerbacks Charles Tillman and Bene Benwikere the Panthers started the season 140 and finished with an NFLbest 151 record
They wont be rattled by any situation and have been loose all season as coach Ron Rivera has allowed his players to be true to their personalities
The Panthers also have the edge at running back with a healthy Jonathan Stewart to go with Newton to lead a ground attack that has rushed for at least 100 yards in 29 straight games Carolina tight end Greg Olsen is one of the best in the NFL and led the Panthers with 77 receptions for 1104 yards and seven scores
Maybe the two position groups most undervalued are the Panthers receivers and offensive line Without Benjamin other receivers stepped up with Corey Brown 31 catches 447 yards four touchdowns rookieDevin Funchess 314735 Jerricho Cotchery 394853 and Ted Ginn 4473910 turning in solid seasons Ginn is also a playmaker on special teams another area where the Panthers have the edge
Outside of wide receiver the Panthers seem to have more talent at every position That should translate to the arrival of the first Lombardi Trophy at Bank of America Stadium
