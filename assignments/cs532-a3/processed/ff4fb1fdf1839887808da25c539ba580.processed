					On a daily basis an estimated 2000 pounds of trash human waste and hypodermic needles are removed from the homeless encampments around San Francisco These are the tent cities that form the backdrop to the monstrous spectacle of decadence that is Super Bowl week in the Bay Area

Last August San Franciscos Mayor Ed Lee made clear that a cleansing of the homeless would take place before the Super Bowl saying They are going to have to leave Well give you an alternative we are always going to be supportive but you are going to have to leave the streets Currently there is no evidence of widespread masssweeps But according to several Bay Area homeless rights activists and social workers with whom I spoke it seems that when the cameras are on the city cleans up trash When the cameras are off the city cleans up people whom the San Francisco Police Department treat as if they are equally disposable		
As private planes engage in the yearly Super Bowl ritual of fighting for space at area airports they will be entering a city that serves as a macrocosm of both the excesses of the big game and the human cost to be paid by many of the players we will be cheering on the field While the city is having another of its periodic realestate booms creating the most expensive housing market in the nationwith a minuscule onebedroom apartments going for 3500 a monththe number of homeless in San Francisco is staggering In a city with an official population of about 800000 there are from 7000 to 10000 homeless As Jessica Hanson Weaver a social worker who works in the largest of the San Francisco homeless shelters said to me That number goes up and down depending on variety of factors It includes youth families and adults in shelters and also those in streets living in parks or in the care of hospitals		
It is certainly true that one cannot blame the current missioncreep subtlesweep of the homeless solely on the Super Bowl Thats because for Mayor Ed Lee the crackdown on the homeless is not a Super Bowl phenomenon but a yearround game In 2015 the police of San Francisco handed out roughly 2300 citations a month to homeless people Thats 77 every day These citations lead to arrest which leads to warehousing people behind bars instead of confronting the near total absence of affordable housing The greatest sin in all of this is that 61 percent of the homeless lost their homes while still employed There is just nowhere to live		
As Hanson Weaver said to me Over the past five years we have seen a sixfold increase in citations against homeless people This is because areas where homeless have traditionally found shelterTenderloin Civic Center South of Marketare in the center of a new massive development of the MidMarket area that surrounds Twitter headquarters

This housing and human crisis has led to a series of protests over the past week against the estimated 5 million in public spending on Super Bowl infrastructure a deal that analysts are saying is lousy for the city Five million dollars could have meant 500 units of new housing Instead it has gone primarily toward to building Super Bowl City an NFL street fair for the locals who cant afford tickets to the game Its a street fair branded with corporate logos and monitored as journalist Davey D told us by police in full body armor and rooftop snipers turning public sidewalks into the property of the National Football League and their sponsors		
Yet while Twitter HQ has become a symbol for the gentrification and skyrocketing costs in the city the social media platform has also become an organizing tool for resistance On Wednesday hundreds took to the streets in a protest under the banner tacklehomelessness The protests are aimed at challenging the priorities of SF leaders These protests provide the only vestiges of hope for this remarkable urban area that has become more than a tale of two cities Its a tale of two worlds		
I spoke with activist Nato Green who describes himself as the countrys only semifunctional hybrid of comedian and union organizer		
His comments deserve reading and rereading The Super Bowl is the literal physical manifestation of Mayor Lees term San Francisco has become uninhabitable for anyone but rich people and tourists At the same time that the mayor is stonewalling investigations into racist police violence and political corruption in his administration huge swaths of public space are inaccessible to residents for private parties He put the city on the hook for millions of dollars based on an insider handshake agreement with the representative of the Super Bowl Committee who happened to be the spokesman for the previous mayor His policies created a crisis of eviction and displacement and now police are rounding up and flooding the homeless encampments they caused so Super Bowl 50 VIPs dont have to see it Mayor Lee is trying to make San Francisco into a managed simulacrum of a city like Disneylands Main Street with animatronic urbanism and police are there to evict the remaining real residents who get in the way Were not going to make it easy for him		
If there is one positive about the debt displacement and militarization that the Super Bowl has amplified in San Francisco it is that it has shined a piercing light on the problems that plague the area In the light of day the priorities of this managed simulacrum of a city have never been more exposed

										I lived in the Bay Area from 1995 to 2000 first in San Francisco and then I moved to Oakland because after my divorce I couldnapost afford the high rent where I was living at the time But even back then the hand writing was on the wall with gentrification high rents and the legion of homeless people San Francisco is a great city a world class city But so very expensive

										Frankly it is not a quotworld class cityquot these days  In 1950 yes  The fact that the title is thrown around constantly shows how good the chamber of commerce is there  Itaposs main industry has been TOURISM for quite some time  And especially the arrivistes would not know world class from a hole in their ass   Witness events right now

										Iaposd suggest there will not be a solution for people who care about human beings  San Francisco changed so dramatically in the 1980aposs the old city basically lost itaposs soul  I lived there for a time watched my gay cohorts get sick and die and the next thing that happened was straights were moving into the gentrified gay areas for lower rent   At the same time the elderly and blue collar class mostly disappeared from the city as a residence  The tech class doesnapost give a fucking damn about the city   They like the views  They donapost talk to people in the neighborhoods they donapost have to   Might as well be Houston for all they care
