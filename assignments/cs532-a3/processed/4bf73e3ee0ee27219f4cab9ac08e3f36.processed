Peyton Manning and Beyonce will be among the star names at this yearx27s Super Bowl












 It is the worlds biggest annual sporting spectacle  but the hype around the NFLs Super Bowl leaves a lot of people on this side of the pond mystified  More than 110 million people in the United States are expected to tune in when the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers do battle on Sunday night Many will stay up late to watch it here  and if youre not clued up heres all you need to know What is the Super Bowl After a 16match regular season then three rounds of knockout games the professional American football season culminates with the annual Super Bowl final  and 2016 is the 50th edition  

New England Patriots Rob Gronkowski holds up Vince Lombardi trophy after his side won last seasons Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks


 Where is it being played The Super Bowl takes place in different stadiums each year and mainly in warmer states so fans and players dont freeze In one game in January temperatures plunged to minus 21C This years Super Bowl is in the warmer climes of Levis Stadium Santa Clara California  the home field of the San Francisco 49ers

What exactly is the Super Bowl and where can I see it in Cardiff  Who is taking part The Super Bowl pits the winners of the NFLs American Football Conference  this year the Denver Broncos  against its National Football Conference champions the Carolina Panthers The Broncos are led by veteran quarterback Peyton Manning widely considered one of the outstanding quarterbacks of this or any generation However at the age of 39 there are questions over his fitness  especially when compared to his opposite number Panthers QB Cam Newton Newton is expected to be named this seasons star man  the socalled Most Valuable Player  after guiding his team to 15 wins out of 16 in the regular season

 Who should I support Cheering on the underdogs Want to see a quarterbacks highlightreel career capped with a Super Bowl Prefer orange to black and blue Then Denver Otherwise opt for Newtons swashbuckling highoctane Carolina How does the game work In basic terms a team has four plays called downs to advance 10 yards or more upfield If they succeed they are given a fresh set of four downs The aim is to score a touchdown by catching the ball in the endzone or throwing it in If they fail they usually kick the ball away and make their opponents start their own attack as deep as possible If they are near enough to the goal line they will probably attempt a field goal on that fourth down

NFL players could soon wear helmets designed by Cardiff University experts to help reduce brain injuries  How many points is it all worth A touchdown gives you six and there is an extra point for a kicked conversion Occasionally a team will elect to have one play to attempt to score what is effectively a second touchdown which gives two points A field goal is worth three points A lesserseen safety  when a player is tackled in their own endzone  gives the opposition two points Who is going to score or stop the points On Carolinas side outstanding tight end dont laugh Greg Olsen and wide receiver Ted Ginn have had stellar seasons catching 18 touchdowns between them while running back Jonathan Stewart is also a key man

Oakland Raiders players enter Wembley Stadium in London before their game against the Miami Dolphins


 OK I get the basics But why does the game have to stop so often The whole point of the sport is that in between plays or downs the teams line up again from where the ball has advanced to Teams usually get in a huddle and talk about which routes they are going to run for the next play or how they will defend it There is a maximum of 40 seconds allowed between plays What about all the ad breaks There are plenty of them as well  during injuries when coaches challenge a referees decision during scheduled intervals And the Super Bowl comes with the most expensive ad break slots What happens if I find the match a bit boring The Super Bowl is perhaps as famous for its half time show as for the game

Chris Martin of Coldplay speaks during a Super Bowl news conference


  This year Coldplay are headlining with Beyonce and Bruno Mars also set to make an appearance  Organisers will hope the minigig passes without any incidents along the lines of Janet Jacksons infamous wardrobe malfunction in 2004 What else can I do Eat and drink Plenty According to US broadcaster ABC almost 50m Americans will order a takeaway during the game  thats about the same as the population of England ABC also quotes National Chicken Council figures which say 13bn chicken wings will be eaten across the US during the game Yep 13bn  or 74000 tonnes And last year Americans splurged 140m pound97m on crisps  or chips as they are known over there  in the week running up to last years Super Bowl What should I say  Im not convinced Denvers offence has enough firepower to cope with the likes of Josh Norman  This is surely Peyton Mannings last hurrah  he cant possibly survive another season of being beaten up  Of course the Broncos have an unbeaten record when Super Bowl referee Clete Blakeman officiates What shouldnt I say  Why do they wear helmets when rugby players dont  

Jim RogashGetty Images


Vince Wilfork during his days with the New England Patriots


 But why do they wear helmets when rugby players dont Although there are many similarities  the ball the goals the point scoring the general gist of the game  rugby and American football are clearly very different games For a start obstruction off the ball is not so much permitted as actively encouraged Tackles are often from a players blindside and so extra protection is needed Where can I watch it  In the UK the match is being broadcast live on BBC One Sky Sports and there is radio commentary on BBC 5 live sports extra Kick off is listed for 1130pm  but prematch shenanigans mean it is almost invariably later than that
