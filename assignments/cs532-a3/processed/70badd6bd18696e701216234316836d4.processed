                                        The idea that there is anything questionable about coating a sporting event in military promotion is the furthest thing from the minds of most viewers
                                    

                                    																	
                                        
                                            			
                                            
                                                 
                                                
                                                Super Bowl 50 will be the first National Football League championship to happen since it was reported that much of the promilitary hoopla at football games the honoring of troops and glorifying of wars that most people had assumed was voluntary or part of a marketing scheme for the NFL has actually been a moneymaking scheme for the NFL The US military has been dumping millions of our dollars part of a recruitment and advertising budget thats in the billions into paying the NFL to publicly display love for soldiers and weaponry							
                                        
                                            			
                                            
                                                 
                                                
                                                Of course the NFL may in fact really truly love the military just as it may love the singers it permits to sing at the Super Bowl halftime show but it makes them pay for the privilege too And why shouldnt the military pay the football league to hype its heroism It pays damn near everybody else At 28 billion a year on recruiting some 240000 quotvolunteersquot thats roughly 11600 per recruit Thats not of course the trillion with a T kind of spending it takes to run the military for a year thats just the spending to gently persuade each quotvolunteerquot to join up The biggest military quotservicequot ad buyer in the sports world is the National Guard The ads often depict humanitarian rescue missions Recruiters often tell tall tales of quotnondeploymentquot positions followed by free college But it seems to me that the 11600 would have gone a long way toward paying for a year in college And in fact people who have that money for college are far less likely to be recruited							
                                        
                                            			
                                            
                                                 
                                                
                                                Despite showing zero interest in signing up for wars and despite the permanent presence of wars to sign up for 44 percent of US Americans tell the Gallup polling company that they quotwouldquot fight in a war yet dont Thats at least 100 million new recruits Luckily for them and the world telling a pollster something doesnt require follow through but it might suggest why football fans tolerate and even celebrate military national anthems and troophyping hoopla at every turn They think of themselves as willing warriors who just happen to be too busy at the moment As they identify with their NFL team making remarks such as quotWe just scoredquot while firmly seated on their most precious assets football fans also identify with their team on the imagined battlefield of war

Tillman couldnt confirm it because he had died in Afghanistan in 2004 from three bullets to the forehead at short range bullets shot by an American The White House and the military knew Tillman had died from socalled friendly fire but they falsely told the media hed died in a hostile exchange Senior Army commanders knew the facts and yet approved awarding Tillman a Silver Star a Purple Heart and a posthumous promotion all based on his having died fighting the quotenemyquot Clearly the military wants a connection to football and is willing to lie as well as to pay for it The Pat Tillman Foundation misuses a dead mans name to play on and prey on the mutual interest of football and the military in being connected to each other							
                                        
                                            			
                                            
                                                 
                                                
                                                Those on whom the militarys advertising succeeds will not typically die from friendly fire Nor will they die from enemy fire The number one killer of members of the US military reported yet again for another year this week is suicide And thats not even counting later suicides by veterans Every TV pundit and presidential debate moderator and perhaps even a Super Bowl 50 announcer or two tends to talk about the militarys answer for ISIS What is its answer for people being stupidly ordered into such horrific hell that they wont want to live anymore

                                                quotFirst theres a violation of the militarys ethics regulations which explicitly state that Department of Defense personnel cannot suggest official endorsement or preferential treatment of any nonFederal entity event product service or enterprise  Under this regulation the Army cannot legally endorse Budweiser nor allow its activeduty personnel to participate in their ads let alone wear their uniforms any more than the Army can endorse Gatorade or Nikequot							
                                        
                                            			
                                            
                                                 
                                                
                                                Two serious issues with this First the military routinely endorses and promotes the NFL Second despite my deepseated opposition to the very existence of an institution of mass murder and my clear understanding of what it wants out of advertisements whether by itself or by a car or beer company I cant help getting sucked into the emotion The technique of this sort of propaganda heres another ad is very high level The rising music The facial expressions The gestures The buildup of tension The outpouring of simulated love Youd have to be a monster not to fall for this poison And it permeates the world of millions of wonderful young people who deserve better

                                                If you get past the commercials theres the problem of the stadium for Super Bowl 50 unlike most stadiums for most sports events being conspicuously quotprotectedquot by the military and militarized police including with military helicopters and jets that will shoot down any drones and quotinterceptquot any planes Ruining the pretense that this is actually for the purpose of protecting anyone military jets will show off by flying over the stadium as in past years when they have even done it over stadiums covered by domes							
                                        
                                            			
                                            
                                                 
                                                
                                                The idea that there is anything questionable about coating a sporting event in military promotion is the furthest thing from the minds of most viewers of the Super Bowl That the militarys purpose is to kill and destroy that its recent major wars have eventually been opposed as bad decisions from the start by a majority of Americans just doesnt enter into it On the contrary the military publicly questions whether it should be associating with a sports league whose players hit their wives and girlfriends too much							
                                        
                                            			
                                            
                                                 
                                                
                                                My point is not that assault is acceptable but that murder isnt The progressive view of the Super Bowl in the United States will question the racism directed at a black quarterback the concussions of a violent sport that damages the brains of too many of its players and perhaps even the recruitment of new players from the far reaches of the empire to take their place sexist treatment of cheerleaders or women in commercials and perhaps even the disgusting materialism of some of the commercials But not the militarism The announcers will thank quotthe troopsquot for watching from quotover 175 countriesquot and nobody will pause set down their beer and dead animal flesh and ask whether 174 countries might not be enough to have US troops in right now
