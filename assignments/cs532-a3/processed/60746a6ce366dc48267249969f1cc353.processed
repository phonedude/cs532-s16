        With the New Hampshire primaries just days away Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders met on a debate stage in Durham on Thursday In their first oneonone matchup the duo seemed determined to illustrate Archilochuss classic binary between the fox who knows many things and the hedgehog who knows one important thing Sanders knows that what the country needsthe only thing it needsis a political and economic revolution Clinton knows the country needs progressive policies on a range of matters and a pragmatic realistic strategy to implement themThat divide was clear from their opening statements with Sanders immediately jumping to his familiar mantra about a rigged economy and a corrupt campaignfinance scheme Clintons answer was not so laser focused discussing a general need for the nation to live up to our values in the 21st century and checking off not just the economy but racism sexism and more This split is not new of course but with Martin OMalley off the stage and out of the race and the Democratic contest tighter than ever the division has never been so clear It led to an unusually interesting debate with the two candidates frequently addressing each other directly and delving into detailAt times it was clear why Sanderss hedgehog approach has been so popular with many Democratsthe ones who nearly delivered him an upset win in the Iowa caucuses and the ones in New Hampshire who favor him by some 20 points in polls That was especially true as they squabbled over who is a true progressive and as Clinton tried to defend her highly remunerative speeches to Goldman Sachs But at other times it seemed more like a limitation Quizzed on foreign policy Sanders seemed at sea about events overseasThe first segment of the debate focused largely on labels picking up on an argument that has raged over the last few days over who is a progressive and who is not Sanders has pointed out and did again on Thursday that Clinton identified herself as a moderate last fall he said that one can be a moderate or a progressive but not both What we have got to do is wage a political revolution Clinton rejected that as simplistic presenting herself as a progressive who gets thing done and suggesting Sanders would not The two also fielded questions about Sanderss recent registration as a Democrat and which of them is an outsiderThere are two ways to see the fight over progressivism On one level its a rather frivolous piece of identity politics Who cares what they call themselves But for Sanders its a way to show that Clinton says different things to different audiences Whatever else you care to say about Sanders he hasnt changed his story for decades The conversation also forces Clinton into silly places such as insisting that shes not part of the establishment Does any American really believe that But Clinton playing aggressively got in a couple good licks at Sanders arguing that his definition of a progressive would rule out Barack Obama Joe Biden and even Paul Wellstone and adding I dont think it was progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five timesMore clearly substantive was a fight over the role of Wall Street in American politics Clinton botched a question Wednesday about a series of highly remunerative speeches she delivered to Goldman Sachs and she again struggled with it Thursday The former secretary of state noted that she gave many speeches to various organizations But of course thats beside the point Sanderss objection isnt to Clinton making money but to Clinton taking payments from big banks He described Wall Street as based on fraud Thursday and noted the lack of prosecutions of financiers after the 2008 crash Clinton still hasnt crafted a good answer to criticism of her ties to financea pretty good sign that there isnt a good answer to be had Later moderator Chuck Todd asked Clinton if she would release transcripts of all the speeches she gave her answer Ill look into it was neither inspiring nor convincingThe Wall Street discussion produced the single mostheated moment of the debate when Clinton lashed out at Sanders She notes that he accuses politicians of being influenced by money but never specifically names her I think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out Clinton said The line came in the midst of a loud backandforth between the candidates and elicited both cheers and boos She also said she had never changed a vote because of a campaign contributionbut thats not the way systemic corruption works Sanders the hedgehog gets that Clinton the fox sees so many shades of gray that the picture gets fuzzyThe debate next turned to foreign policy On many specifics both candidates agree For example both think the US should be working against ISIS and both oppose sending ground troops to do it Sanders stressed that the United States should avoid foreign entanglements Clinton reeled off a list of policy variables with elan Sanders brought up his vote against the war in Iraq but asked about the relative menace of North Korea Russia and Iran he quickly proved out of his depth meandering and making questionable assertions Multiple dictators in North Korea Clinton can speak with much deeper knowledge on foreign policy but the fact remains that she erred in voting for the war in Iraq as Sanders was happy to remind viewers A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS she said Thursdaysurely true but voters might reasonably question her judgment about ISIS given her record In one sharp exchange Clinton delivered a detailed critique of Sanderss suggestion that the US normalize relations with Iran Sanders accused her of making the same mistake shed made in 2008 when she called Obama nave for wanting to negotiate with Iran about nuclear weaponsBoth candidates delivered strong performances and both drove into a couple of potholes Given what a nonfactor Martin OMalley had been in the previous debates its surprising how different this debate felt But Clinton had deftly played herself against Sanders and OMalley as a pair time and again and removing OMalley deprived her of the chance to do that Sanderss Manichaean perspective on campaign finance and the economy is simple and appeals to many Americans and it makes it hard for Clinton to defend her record The heavy emphasis on just a few issues for most of the debate plays into Sanderss hedgehog strengths Moreover because Sanders has the momentum Clinton was forced to attack him How voters respond to that remains to be seen while her continued insistence that Sanders would dismantle Obamacare still doesnt make senseSanders entered with momentum and did nothing to lose it meaning he probably gains more from the debatebut its hard to make a case that Clinton lost the debate The big winner from the night might be the American people After months of overcrowded debates the chance to see just two serious presidential candidates engage each other was a valuable and refreshing change of paceDavid Graham

That was a good debate but I dont see how it moves a lot of Democratic voters Bernies idealistic legions arent going to be swayed by Hillarys appeals to pragmatism Hillarys supporters are going to continue to see her as out of his league But it was a good debate because voters got a very substantive and wideranging contrast between the candidates differing appeals

Hillary strikes a middle ground you dont hear very often by differentiating between the federal and state deathpenalty system Its one of the clearest times we see her background as a lawyer In response Bernie Sanders takes the philosophical abolitionist approach The state shouldnt be responsible for killing The latest polls show that both Americans and Democrats are closer to Clintons position but the trend is moving towards Sanderss

Clinton says shes 100 percent confident that nothing will come of the FBI investigation into her email But what else is she going to say The fact that some Republican cabinet secretaries also used private email as Clinton notes doesnt strike me as especially exculpatory That just means both parties have engaged in questionable practices right

Sanders paints himself like Obama in 2008 He points out that Clinton called Obama naive then and suggests shes treating him the same way nowbut as he notes Obamas strategy succeeded in achieving an agreement with Iran Obviously verdicts on the quality of that deal differ widely

Im bemused watching these two candidates try to define progressivisma term originally used to describe an era at the turn of the twentieth century As the eminent historian Daniel Rodgers argues there never was a single progressivism or a coherent progressive movement Back in the Progressive Era there were many progressivisms their advocates fighting fiercely against each other on some issues even as they collaborated on others And its contemporary heirs are selective about which parts of that complicated legacy they embracethe term is invoked today its not usually used to mean for example eugenics Whos the real progressive Its a question thats been debated for as long as thereve been progressives

        Does his faith influence his judicial decision making
        
        
            March was a hugely important month for religion and the Supreme Court and a pivotal moment for Justice Antonin Scalia the subject of a fat new biography Too bad we couldnx2019t talk plainly about what was and is at stake In a country historically averse to political debates about competing faiths nowhere is frank discussion of religion more taboo than at the US Supreme Court x201CReligion is the third rail of Supreme Court politics Itx2019s not something thatx2019s talked about in polite companyx201D as Jeff Shesol the author of a book about the New Deal Court put it He was speaking with NPRx2019s Nina Totenberg in 2010 when John Paul Stevens was looking at retirement and for the first time in American history there was the prospect of six Catholics three Jews and no Protestants on the highest court in the landx2014a watershed almost too x201Cradioactivex201D Totenberg remarked even to note And beware of venturing any further than that as the University of Chicago Law Schoolx2019s Geoffrey Stone did in a controversial 2007 blog post suggesting that the Supreme Courtx2019s five conservatives likely derived their abortion views from Catholic doctrine Scaliax2014a devout Catholic and the current Courtx2019s longestserving conservativex2014announced a boycott of the school until Stone leaves the faculty13

        Einsteinrsquos gravitational waves rest on a genuinely radical idea
        
        
            After decades of anticipation we have directly detected gravitational wavesx2014ripples in spacetime traveling at the speed of light through the universe Scientists at LIGO the Laser Interferometic Gravitationalwave Observatory have announced that they have measured waves coming from the inspiral of two massive black holes providing a spectacular confirmation of Albert Einsteinx2019s general theory of relativity whose hundredth anniversary was celebrated just last year13
13
Finding gravitational waves indicates that Einstein was once again right and opens a new window onto energetic events occurring around the universe But therex2019s a deeper lesson as well a reminder of the central importance of locality an idea that underlies much of modern physics13

Coming from Planet Android I wasnx2019t as put off by the larger dimensions as everyone else in the technosphere seemed to be But I was as usual put off by one thing that both the Apple product and its archnemesis from Google shared the unpocketability of the phone particularly by females13
13
This isnx2019t a new problem for women Our skinny jeans have pockets but there is no way an object bigger than a standard issue ID card fits in the front and everyone knows that slipping a phone in your back pocket is an invitation for a treacherous dive into a toilet or a backflip resulting in heartbreaking shatters Purses have enclosures that were once suitable for the flip phone generation but have since become too snug for newer models Throwing it into the main compartment seems risky at best13

            Meryl Streep at the Berlin film festival this week was asked whyx2014given OscarsSoWhite given that itx2019s 2016 given that come onx2014she had convened an allwhite panel to judge this yearx2019s festival entrants Invoking the rhetoric of an American president who had visited Berlin in the course of the last century Streep dismissed objections to her panelx2019s monochromism x201CThe thing that I notice is that there is a core of humanity that travels right through every culturex201D she said x201CAnd after all wex2019re all from Africa originally you know Wex2019re all Berliners wex2019re all Africans reallyx201D13

This wasnx2019t terribly surprising When Streep was asked last year in the course of promoting her extremely feminist film Suffragette whether she is herself a feminist the actor replied that no she isnx2019t Instead x201CI am a humanistx201D she said x201CI am for nice easy balancex201D 13

            As it stands the international coalition is far from winning the information war against the Islamic State Its air strikes may be squeezing the group in Iraq and Syria and killing many of its leaders but that has not halted the selfproclaimed caliphatex2019s ideological momentum Indeed at the end of 2015 it was estimated that the number of foreigners travelling to join militant groups in Iraq and Syriax2014predominantly the Islamic Statex2014had more than doubled in the course of just 18 months Whatx2019s more while these figures may be striking sheer numbers are less important than intent when it comes to the organizationx2019s actual threat to the world As we have already seen it takes a very small number of people to unleash great terror whether in Iraq Syria or elsewhere13

        Ben Stillerrsquos followup to his own comedy classic is a downright bummer no matter how many celebrity cameos it tries to cram in
        
        
            You donx2019t need to go to the theater to get the full experience of Zoolander 2 Simply get your hands on a copy of the original watch it and then yell a bunch of unfunny topical lines every time somebody tells a joke Thatx2019s how it feels to watch Ben Stillerx2019s sequel to his 2001 spoof of the fashion industry Zoolander 2 takes pains to reference every successful gag you remember from the original and then embellish them in painfulx2014often offensive almost always outdatedx2014fashion Itx2019s a film that has no real reason to exist and it spends its entire running time reaffirming that fact13

The original Zoolander to be fair had no business being as funny as it wasx2014it made fun of an industry that already seems to exist in a constant state of selfparody and much of its humor relied on simple malapropisms and sight gags But it was hilarious anyway as a candid snapshot of the fizzlingout of x201990s culture Like almost any zeitgeist comedy it belonged to a particular momentx2014and boy should it have stayed there With Zoolander 2 Stiller who directed cowrote and stars tries to recapture the magic of 2001 by referencing its past glories with increasing desperation perhaps to avoid the fact that he has nothing new to say about the fashion industry or celebrity culture 15 years laters13

13
Many people in this world would find my behavior rather strange Thatx2019s because Americans are exceptionally promiscuous when it comes to professing their love In the United States x201CI love youx201D is at once exalted and devalued It can mean everything  or nothing at all This is not universally the case13
