How do you know when Manning is legitimately worried He gets angry and vindictive and he absolutely will not let goTo wit way back in 1996 when Manning was a junior at the University of Tennessee he allegedly sexually harassed a female trainer According to this excerpt from the universitys investigative report Jamie Ann Naughright then Whited was treating Mannings foot when he began asking me several personal questions including whether she hangs out with people she works withnbsp
When Naughright rebuffed Manning he decided to drop trou Naughright had her head down but upon hearing the chuckles and guffaws she looked up only to find herself facetoface with Mannings exposed ass and testiclesIt was the gluteus maximus the rectum the testicles and the area in between the testicles And all that was on my face when I pushed him up Naughright would later say in a court deposition in a suit against the University of Tennessee more on this in a bit To get leverage I took my head out to push him up and off
How did UT discipline Manning They took away his privilege to eat at the athletic facilities dining room and requiring him to run at 600 am for two weeks The dining room ban was subsequently reduced to two weeks as well
The allegations made against Manning came to light as one of numerous sexual harassment claims cited against the University of Tennessee Naughright and the university ended up agreeing to a 300000 settlement The terms remained confidential
But Manning needed to have the final word In the book he cowrote with his father Archie and a ghostwriter Manning A Father His Sons and a Football Legacy though he described his actions as inappropriate he felt Naughright should have laughed off the upclose display of his rump and should have viewed it as Crude maybe but harmless Manning also felt the need to call her a vulgar woman swore that he was actually mooning a fellow teammate not Naughright and said that all of this unpleasantness could have been avoided were it not for the destruction of maleonly spaces
Never mind that women in the mens locker room is one of the most misbegotten concessions to equal rights ever made Manning wrote When Dad played there was still at least a tacit acknowledgment that women and men are two different sexes with all that implies and a certain amount of decorum had to be maintained Meaning when it came to training rooms and shower stalls the opposite sex was not allowed Common sense tells you whyCommon sense indeed In 2002 Naughright filed a defamation lawsuit against Manning claiming that he was attempting to rewrite history Naughright had since moved on to Florida Southern College and though she wasnt personally named by Manning in the book she received a letter addressed to Dr Vulgar Mouth WhitedIt became common knowledge on campus that Dr Naughright was the athletic trainer referred to by the defendants in Manning the lawsuit stated As a result she was treated differently by both students and colleagues and her employment situation at Florida Southern College became untenable which ultimately resulted in her leaving the employment of Florida Southern CollegeAs to the question of to whom Manning wanted to show his ass Malcolm Saxon a track and field athlete who was in the room during the incident wrote a letter to Manning to say that no he was not the intended moonee as Manning had written in his book imploring him to maintain some dignity and admit to what happened Your celebrity doesnt mean you can treat folks that way Do the right thing here
Naughright and Manning ended up agreeing to an outofcourt settlement in 2003 that included a confidentiality ban on both parties He felt it was his mistake he tried to apologize and he was remorseful Archie Manning told the Associated Press of his sons incident in 2003 He got punished and he took his punishment

If that wasnt enough of a PR pushback Manning even signed up George Bushs former press secretary Ari Fleischer to bash Al JazeeraOnce again Manning couldnt resist the temptation to take a potshot at an already beaten target In early January after reporters told him that Al Jazeera America would be permanently shuttering its doors he sarcastically told USA Today Im sure thats just devastating to all their viewers
The Daily Beast emailed Mike Freeman Bleacher Reports NFL national lead writer to ask why Manning turns to this brand of bullying offensive when hes challengedFor every classy part of Manning the one that sells pizzas and says Golly gee and aw shucks there is a bit of a ruthless guy in my opinion he wrote This is not stated maliciously Its stated honestly I think what he did with Jamie is an example of that He does that exposes himself to her which is a despicable thing and then later in his book takes a shot at her That shot was calculated It was a way of trying to diminish Jamie and her original accusationsAccording to Freeman Manning is able to get away with this because he is to a certain degree immune from criticismPart of the reason why Manning hits back twice as hardwhich is his rightis because he knows hell receive cover from large swaths of the media who will believe anything he says he wrote There are football writers lots of them that would lay their bodies over a puddle of water and let Manning walk over their bodies so his cleats dont get wetAnd it worked Despite the revelation of a second confidential source verifying Al Jazeeras investigation Mannings alleged HGH use has been more or less relegated to a nonstory even in the midst of the relentless press frenzy that is Super Bowl media weekThe comparison to Cam Newton the quarterback thatll be on the other side of field on Super Bowl Sunday couldnt be more stark not when detractors still cite his relatively trivial stolen laptop incident that got him booted from the University of Florida or as grave an offense as his touchdown celebrations inspire pearlclutching letters to the editor bemoaning his arrogance calling him a spoiled brat and literally begging him to think about the children Granted as Slates Tommy Craggs wrote the Tennessee Moms panic feels like an outlier a holdout in a culture war long since ended an old soldier bustling out of a cave with fixed bayonet blinking in a new days sun
But were PED allegations leveled at Newton its hard to imagine Al Jazeera itself would be on the receiving end of the bulk of the criticism and seen its credibility repeatedly questioned CBSs Jim Nantz decided that the best course of action here is total silence If we talk about it we would only continue to breathe life into a story that on all levels is a nonstory Nantz explained Funny thing Nantz and Manning share an agent who also happens to be a former business partner of Ari FleischersAngrily not talking about Manning is practically a cottage industry Al Jazeera is not a credible news organization Theyre out there spreading garbage ESPNs Mike Ditka told The Boston Globe Thats what they do yet we give them credibility by talking about it

Fox News even went so far as to wonder if Al Jazeeras real agenda here was to destroy American icons and US institutions 
In this friendly a media climate where alleged sexual harassment is largely forgotten why would Peyton Manning worry
