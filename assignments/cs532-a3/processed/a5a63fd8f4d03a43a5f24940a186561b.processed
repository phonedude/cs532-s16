NASHUA NH  One axiom of presidential politics is that surviving the primaries requires appeal to the loudest and most extreme elements of ones own party while leaving enough wiggle room to win a general electionOne thing Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders has in common with tea party favorite Ted Cruz and some others in the GOP field is that he hasnt read that playbookThat put him at a distinct advantage in Thursday nights debate with Hillary ClintonTheres plenty of overlap in the Democrats views on campaign finance reform Wall Street pay inequality Afghanistan ISIS and so on Sanders insists that Clinton isnt progressive enough She insists that hes not the arbiter of such things and if he were no one but he would measure upIf Clinton makes it to the general election her adversaries in the GOP will have plenty of fodder to paint her as a leftistShe supports gun control abortion rights higher taxes universal health care She vigorously defends President Barack Obamas foreign policies executive orders and signature health care lawSanders is unabashedly liberal Free college paid for by taxes on Wall Street speculation Clintons response Im not making promises that I cannot keepBut she would never say things like this from Sanders Thursday night The business model of Wall Street is fraudLike Sanders Clinton promises to hike taxes on the wealthiest Americans She denounces the excesses of the financial sector But she wont promise to break up the big banks now and she resists his demand to strengthen policing of Wall Street She buys into the capitalist systemFor the Sanders wing of the party this makes her suspect Its one reason he fought her to a near draw in Iowa and leads her by double digits in New HampshireUnlike Sanders who apparently never expected to get this far Clinton has long imagined herself as president So shes walking a tightrope Shes more conventional and shes actually planning to win in the fallIn the short run that makes it a bit tricky

About Todd J Gillman

Career track I started writing for my junior high school newspaper the Redcoat In high school I freelanced a bit for the local weeklywrote for the school paper and worked on a weekly public access TV news show that was long on enthusiasm and short on production values During college at Johns Hopkins University I interned for The Associated Press and later The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times I started at The Dallas Morning News as an intern after graduating from Harvards Kennedy School of Government with a masters in public policy got hired on the Texas amp Southwest desk and spent the next several years covering plane crashes hurricanes and state politics After a few years as a general assignments reporter on the Metropolitan desk I moved to the City Hall
beat and later became the local political writer and columnist I moved
to the Washington bureau after nearly two years as a Dallasbased national
correspondent 
Most unforgettable experience on the job Talking my way into Ground
Zero on a rainy day a week or so after Sept 11 and absorbing the enormity
of it all My dad used to commute through the Trade Center A close second
would be my first hurricane when I was still an intern driving across
the bridge to Galveston in gales strong enough to push my rental car into
the next lane and tear off the rear license plate which I keep as a souvenir
Something people dont know about me Ive been having TexMex withdrawal
ever since moving to Washington
If I had two spare hours I would Go hiking with my wife and kids
How I define a true Texan The three natives running around my house
yelling for mama
