			Irsquom a bit winded after Saturdayrsquos 13race card at Gulfstream Park and I did a double take when I realized todayrsquos card also includes 13 races

Things went pretty well for us yesterday with four winners on top and five recommended exactas at Gulfstream Park 7620 2940 3700 3420 and 5320

We saw two awesome performances by threeyearolds at Santa Anita Mor Spirit won the 150000 Robert B Lewis G3 and earned 10 points toward entry into the Kentucky Derby G1 The Bob Baffert trainee now has 24 points good for second in the standings behind Nyquist

 As of Saturday evening the colt was listed at odds of 81 in future Derby betting at Sportsbookag good for second choice Mohaymen is the early favorite at odds of 41

Perhaps the best threeyearold in training is a filly Songbird remained undefeated with her win in the 300000 Las Virgenes G2 her fifth career win

She won by 6 frac12 lengths while under a hammerlock form her jockey Mike Smith She probably would be the favorite for the Derby but her connections insist she is being pointed toward the Kentucky Oaks G1

She is currently the early betting favorite for the Oaks at Sportsbookag at odds of 12 That is not a misprint it is really 12 The second choice in the betting is Rachels Valentina at 81

The marathon 13race card at Gulfstream Park concludes at 553 ET which gives us about a half hour to settle in for the Super Bowl

My Best Plays Report for Sunday includes my eight strongest plays from Aqueduct and Gulfstream Park including all of the stakes action

Here is todayrsquos opener from Gulfstream Park to get the day off to a good start

GP Race 1 Clm 6250 1200 ET 
2 Artefacto 85 
6 Right On Ready 95 
3 Keyed Cache 151 
4 Buongiorno Johnny 61

Analysis Artefacto took the field gate to wire to beat 12500 claimers last out and the gelding has now landed in the exacta in 7 of 12 starts over the main track here There is plenty of speed signed up but he has shown an ability to track He looks sharp enough to win right back here for the Navarro barn

Right on Ready could complete a chalky exacta to start the day The gelding has won five in a row his last pair against open 6250 foes He was claimed out of his last outing by the Nunn barn that is 4 for 27 first off the claim dating back five years Three of his last four wins have come on off tracks A logical threat here as he seldom runs a bad one

AQU Race 8 OClm 75000N1X 420 ET 
2 Bust Another 101 
6 Spooked Out 11 
1 Fumin Newman 61 
3 Gehrig 51

Analysis Bust Another tracked the early pace and finished strongly to beat 32000 claimers last out here by six lengths The runner up The Great Whiteway came back to beat 25000 claimers in his next outing on Feb 4 Our top pick was claimed out of his win by the Pino barn that is 24 winners with a ROI first off the claim He looks capable of moving forward off his last start and the 101 morning line looks generous


Spooked Out is coming off a fourth in the state bred Damon Runyon where he headed for home with the lead and was beaten just a halflength He cuts back to a sprint here and he broke his maiden at six furlongs here on the main track by 9 12 lengths in his second career start He looks legit but at a very short price

GP Race 10 Md 12500 423 ET 
6 Olympic Smoke 31 
4 Baby Antonella 61 
10 Starship Maiden 41 
14 Unknown 51

Analysis Olympic Smoke adds lasix and cuts back to six panels here after tracking the early pace and tiring to finish a well beaten sixth last out Two back this gal dueled for the early lead before weakening to finish fourth The filly is out of a stakes placed Gilded Time mare that has dropped six winners There is not much speed in here and even with the cut back this filly should be in the mix early

Baby Antonella drops a notch in class to the bottom here after checking in fifth last out for a 16000 tag She adds blinkers which may put her closer to the front here She has been on wet tracks in two of her three starts and has been the beaten favorite in her last pair If she runs back to her third in her debut at the 35000 level that would be good enough to beat this group
