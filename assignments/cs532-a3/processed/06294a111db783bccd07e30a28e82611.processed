	The mood was triumphant on the morning of July 21 2010 when Barack Obama not quite two years into his presidency strode to a podium inside the Ronald Reagan Building a few blocks from the White House As he prepared to sign the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Actmdashthe sweeping legislative package designed to prevent another spectacular financial collapsemdashinto law the president first acknowledged the miracle of having a bill to sign at all ldquoPassing thishellipwas no easy taskrdquo he told the crowd of hundreds ldquoWe had to overcome the furious lobbying of an array of powerful interest groups and a partisan minority determined to block changerdquo

Indeed some 3000 lobbyists had swarmed the Capitol in hopes of killing off pieces of the proposed billmdashnearly six lobbyists for every member of Congress For Michael Barr then an assistant secretary at the Treasury Department the trench warfare spurred by DoddFrank left him shellshocked ldquoYou pick a page at randomrdquo says Barr now a law professor at the University of Michigan ldquoand Irsquoll tell you about all the issues on that page where the fighting was intenserdquo Remarkably despite the onslaught DoddFrank ldquogot stronger rather than weaker the closer we got to passage which is incredibly unusualrdquo says Lisa Donner executive director of Americans for Financial Reform one of a handful of advocacy groups that fought tenaciously for the bill		
That sense of victory barely lasted the morning The same financial behemoths that had fought so ferociously to block DoddFrank were not going to let the mere fact of the billrsquos passage ruin their plans ldquoHalftimerdquo shrugged Scott Talbott chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable a lobbying group representing 100 of the countryrsquos largest financial institutions It was 530 am on a Friday when a joint HouseSenate conference committee approved the billrsquos final language By Sunday an industry lawyer named Annette Nazarethmdasha former top official at the Securities and Exchange Commission whose firm counts JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs among its clientsmdashhad already sent off a heavily annotated copy of the 848page bill to colleagues at her old agency According to a congressional staffer whose boss was a key architect of DoddFrank Nazareth is one of two ldquogeneralsrdquo running the campaign to undo the bill The other is Eugene Scalia a fearsome litigator and son of the Supreme Court justice		
After DoddFrankrsquos passage lobbyists for the big banks and industry trade groups divided themselves into eighteen working groups each organized around a different element of the new law ldquoThatrsquos when the real work beganrdquo Talbott tells me One working group focused on derivatives reform including the requirement that these complex financial instruments now be sold on open exchanges in the fashion of stocks and bonds Another focused on efforts to hammer out the socalled Volcker Rule which would limit the ability of federally insured banks to wager on risky ventures A third tackled the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB created to protect ordinary consumers from Wall Street deceptions involving mortgages credit cards and other major profit centers for the banks		
In the months leading up to DoddFrankrsquos passage the big story was the staggering sums of money being spent by the industry to defeat the billmdashmore than 1 billion on lobbying alone according to one estimate Yet incredibly the financial sector dramatically increased its spending after DoddFrank was signed Whereas commercial banks such as Wells Fargo Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase along with their trade groups spent 55 million lobbying in 2010 the year DoddFrank became law they would collectively spend 61 million in 2011 and again in 2012 according to OpenSecretsorg The twentyeight lobbyists Talbott has on the payroll at the Financial Services Roundtable makes it relative small fry The American Bankers Association has ninetyone lobbyists representing its interests while the US Chamber of Commerce has 183 Goldman Sachs has fiftyone lobbyists JPMorgan Chase sixty and even the obscuresounding Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association is armed to the teeth hiring the services of fortynine lobbyists

Even so those numbers donrsquot begin to capture the army of people being paid exorbitant sums to beat back reform ldquoThe lobbyists are just the point of the spearrdquo said Ed Mierzwinski director of consumer programs for the US Public Interest Research Group PIRG ldquoThere are also the regulatory lawyers the research staffs the PR people and all those loyal think tank supporters shilling for the banksrdquo		
DoddFrankrsquos Achillesrsquo heel is that it leaves the tough work of writing the actual regulations to existing federal agencies like the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission which had failed so miserably at protecting the public interest in the runup to the 2008 crash as well as to backwater independent agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC which was tasked with regulating a derivatives market that played a central role in the collapse of the global economy		
The story of how Wall Street lobbyists worked the halls of Congress blocking the appointment of Elizabeth Warren Obamarsquos first choice to head the CFPB or pushing bills aimed at defanging DoddFrank is fairly wellknown by now But it was the stealthy work of battalions of regulatory lawyers who descended on the private offices of regulators deep inside the bureaucracy that has proven more crucial to the industryrsquos effort to pick off pieces of DoddFrank There a kind of ground war has been going on for almost three years with the regulators waging handtohand combat to defend every clause and comma in DoddFrank and the lawyers fighting to insert any loophole they can to protect their clientsrsquo extraordinary profits This is how the miracle that was the making of DoddFrankmdashhailed as the most comprehensive financial reform since the 1930smdashbecame a slowmoving horror movie called ldquoThe Unmaking of DoddFrankrdquo a perfect case study of the ways an industry with nearly unlimited resources can avoid a set of toughminded reforms it doesnrsquot like

	Sadly part of this story involves the reluctance of the left and Democrats generally to rally around a bill that failed to deliver everything reformers wanted Lisa Donner can readily tell you everything that DoddFrank doesnrsquot do Shersquos heard her share of grumbling as executive director of Americans for Financial Reform a coalition of 250 consumer labor and civil rights organizations that joined forces during the debate over the bill Among the criticisms it doesnrsquot reinstate GlassSteagall the Depressionera lawmdashtossed in the 1990smdashthat walled off the banks in which ordinary people keep their savings from highrisk investment banking no banker will stand trial because of the bill nor has it provided compensation to a single family who lost their home in the subprime disaster

But if itrsquos possible to love a piece of legislation Donner is smitten with DoddFrank She sums up the CFPB as ldquoastonishingrdquo and deems the billrsquos regulation of derivatives ldquovery importantrdquo likewise its requirement that a bank hold on to at least 5 percent of any portfolio it securitizes unless itrsquos made of the safest plainvanilla mortgagesmdasha policy that could have gone a long way toward preventing the worst of the subprime calamity She lists several more meltdownrelated provisions that would give regulators ldquopotentially very powerful toolsrdquomdashif they ever take effect		
Plus there are many hidden gems for progressives buried in DoddFrank Therersquos an antibribery clause requiring companies to disclose payments to a foreign government when they acquire drilling and mining rights and another requiring US corporations using ldquoconflict mineralsrdquo to ensure that they were not mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo which is being ravaged by those warring over tin and tungsten Another provision caps the fees a bank can charge for debitcard transactions ldquoTherersquos so much in there we could never have gotten on a single upordown voterdquo Donner says		
And yet this landmark legislative achievement went virtually unmentioned on the 2012 campaign trail If President Obama chose not to trumpet DoddFrank so as not to alienate deeppocketed backers on Wall Street the strategy didnrsquot really pay off Mitt Romneyrsquos top six donors were all financial institutionsmdashincluding Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase which had been among Obamarsquos top ten donors in 2008 but fell off that list in 2012 Organized labor meanwhile perhaps distracted by its own frustrated legislative priorities never mounted a fullcourt press in support of the legislation either The lawrsquos passionate defenders consist of maybe a few dozen advocates totally overwhelmed by the lobbying and legal muscle on the other side		
The mismatch was vividly on display one day last fall when Richard Cordray the CFPBrsquos director at least until his recess appointment expires at the end of this year testified before the Senate Banking Committee The hearing room was thick with powersuited lobbyists wellgroomed and coiffed each wearing shoes that probably cost more than the typical American worker takes home in a week And then there was US PIRGrsquos Ed Mierzwinski bearded and bespectacled wearing tan khakis with a conspicuous stain on one leg His offtherack blue sport coat was paired with a toowide tie slightly askew at his neck Earlier over breakfast at the lowbudget Capitol Hill cafeteria Mierzwinski told me that as US PIRGrsquos point man on financial reform he tries to attend every congressional hearing related to the issue but he simply canrsquot make them all Records maintained by OpenSecretsorg show that US PIRG and the Consumer Federation of America two of the more prominent consumer advocacy groups on Capitol Hill have spent a combined 11 million on lobbyists over the past three yearsmdashin contrast with the more than 350 million spent by the Chamber of Commerce during that same time period or the 25 million laid out by the American Bankers Association

ldquoHow do you compete when one side is this hydraheaded monster that can devote unlimited resources to killing gutting or otherwise weakening financial reformrdquo asks Dennis Kelleher himself a former corporate lawyer who now runs Better Markets a small nonprofit pushing for stronger financial regulations		
And how can you compete asks Bart Chilton a former Agriculture Department official under Bill Clinton who is now a CFTC commissioner with the ldquofullmeal quadrakill dealrdquo Chilton laid out the industryrsquos fourpronged offensive strategy last year at a conference of consumer advocates Phase one is the legislative effort to kill the bill before it has a chance to pass Phase two consists of pushing Congress to defund regulatory agencies like his The third and fourth phases said Chilton who has a speaking style that calls to mind no one so much as Ross Perot is reserved for players like the financial industrymdashldquothe class of folks who have some buckaroosrdquo Phase three began immediately after passage of DoddFrank when those squadrons of regulatory lawyers descended on people like Chilton		
And if a regulator ever succeeds in publishing a rule Chilton says then brace yourself for phase four or what he calls rdquoDefcon 4rdquo the bankers take the regulator to court hiring the likes of Eugene Scalia who has carved out a lucrative niche blocking such rules on technicalities Kelleher calls them ldquosoreloser suitsrdquo but there is no denying their effectiveness one of Scaliarsquos lawsuits can bollix up a rule indefinitely if not get it thrown out entirely Scalia had already filed six DoddFrankrelated suits against the government by the end of 2012mdashand he only smiled when I asked him if he had plans to file more In April he filed a seventh		
Three years after DoddFrank was passed only 148 of the 398 rules requiring action by regulators have been finalized and draft versions have yet to be submitted for half of the remainder Sheila Bair head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation between 2006 and 2011 is among those outraged at that record Bair a lifelong Republican who was picked by President George W Bush to head the FDIC is unhappy that Congress wrote such an overly complex law She also wishes that the regulators would act more boldly But the main culprit she says is the resistance to reform posed by an industry with enormous firepower ldquoAt the end of the dayrdquo Bair says ldquothe regulators are outgunnedrdquo

	Perhaps no part of DoddFrank matters more than the CFTCrsquos battle to implement derivatives reform Certainly the big banks wouldnrsquot argue that point no product peddled by Wall Street has proved as lucrative in recent years especially for the countryrsquos most elite firms Just five banksmdashGoldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase Citigroup Morgan Stanley and Bank of Americamdashaccount for more than a 95 percent share of a derivatives market that has been generating an estimated 40 billion to 50 billion in annual revenues Because derivatives have been traded on dark ie unregulated markets this ldquooligarchyrdquo of five says Darrell Duffie a finance professor at Stanfordrsquos Graduate School of Business and the author of How Big Banks Fail and What to Do About It has been able to charge exorbitant rates to the wide range of businesses and government entities that buy themmdashprofit margins that are sure to plummet if DoddFrank is fully implemented Duffie says That alone would justify the huge sums spent on lobbying to gut DoddFrank a reflection of the banksrsquo unflinching resolve to protect the billions of dollars in derivatives profits they book every year ldquoIf you look at the energy and ferocity and the dollars the financial sector put on the table it was overwhelmingly directed at derivativesrdquo says Michael Barr the former Treasury official

This is why derivativesmdashand by extension the CFTCmdashshould matter to the rest of us as well at least if we want to reduce the odds that the banks will again blow up the global economy anytime soon It was derivatives after allmdashall those credit default swaps collateralized debt obligations and other exotic financial instruments that most of us would learn about in newspaper infographics offered only after the factmdashthat were the main culprit in the collapse of insurance giant AIG They were also the main problem in the failures of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and nearly took down the other big banks as well		
Price manipulations of basic commodities such as oil and grains through derivatives are another target of DoddFrank which instructs the CTFC to create ldquoposition limitsrdquomdashcaps on the portion of a market that financial speculators can own The need for this check on financial speculators has never been clearer than in recent years given the wild fluctuations in the price of oil in 2008 when a barrel of crude rose to 145 before whipsawing back to 37 in early 2009 and a spike in the price of wheat and other basic grains that caused rioting around the world		
The push to regulate a new breed of ever more complex derivatives goes back to the 1990s The catalyst was the central role these instruments played in the financial collapse of Orange County California which in 1994 became the largest municipal entity ever to declare bankruptcy Those in favor of derivatives reform would find their champion in Brooksley Born who headed the CFTC under Bill Clinton Think of most derivatives as a bet on the price of something going up or downmdashan interest rate say or mortgage defaults Her agency was already in the business of regulating the futures markets for commodities such as corn and soybeans Born argued so why not add this new breed of financial derivatives to the CFTCrsquos portfolio But this was in the Clinton era when Democrats worked overtime to win the affections of Wall Street and Wall Street knew that transparency would only spoil a good thing Clintonrsquos top economic advisers including Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers the deputy who would take his place in 1999 overruled Born and worked with Congress to pass what became the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 which had the effect of deregulating much of the derivatives market along with basic commodities like oil Just eight years later the world economy was in tatters in no small part because of that decision		
Those championing derivatives reform were disappointed when Presidentelect Obama named Gary Gensler to head the CFTC in December 2008 Gensler was after all a Wall Street insider who had spent eighteen years at Goldman Sachs Worse he had served as assistant treasury secretary when the disastrous decision on deregulating derivatives was made Given his years at Goldman a central player in that market Gensler was recused from participating in the debate during his first year in office back when the Treasury Department was working overtime to stop Brooksley Born in her tracks But he readily admits that he fought hard in favor of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act His reasoning the banks were already answerable to regulators so why rope in another agency to monitor this one category of product

Yet after watching what transpired Gensler had a change of heartmdashand as DoddFrank was cobbled together in committee Gensler fought his old colleagues at every turn He proved willing to take on his fellow Democrats if it meant giving the CFTC more teeth to pursue reform even causing a kerfuffle inside the White House when he sent a letter to Barney Frank and other committee chairs calling on them to go further than the administrationrsquos proposals in overseeing the derivatives market ldquoHersquos shown that hersquos no industry lapdogrdquo says Barbara Roper the director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America		
Jim Collura a lobbyist for a trade association representing home heating oil companies has been similarly impressed by Gensler Derivatives have understandably become a dirty word among the general public but for the more modestsize businesses that Collura represents theyrsquore an essential tool for keeping price spikes in check His companies routinely buy oil futures as a hedge against future increases in fuel costs The airlines and trucking companies do the same so that gyrations on the global petroleum market donrsquot wipe out their profits Municipalities are another common user of derivatives an interestrate swap can protect taxpayers against increased borrowing costs on a new convention center under construction But the end users of derivatives also donrsquot want to worry that theyrsquore getting ripped off every time they need to buy another swap ldquoMy guys get killed when these markets are opaquerdquo Collura says ldquoand they get killed by outofcontrol speculatorsrdquo After ten years of battle Collura adds and in large part due to Genslerrsquos pressure ldquowe got pretty much everything we wantedrdquo		
But that of course was only halftime		
		
Hall of Shame
	ensp
	Gary Gensler provides an interesting window onto the fight over DoddFrankrsquos implementation These days no one seems to doubt his commitment to seeing through what he started the only question seems to be why his outlook changed so dramatically Gensler shrugs when I ask what prompted his reversal ldquoWe all evolverdquo he says readily acknowledging that he and his colleagues in Treasury made a terrible mistake back in 2000		
Gensler is a short trim man with a twitchy energy that suggests a person in a hurry Thanks to his slight frame bald dome goggling eyes and prodigious nose some in town unkindly joke that he bears a passing resemblance to Mr Burns in The Simpsonsmdashbut then hersquos made plenty of enemies in town ldquoThe banks view him as an apostaterdquo Dennis Kelleher says ldquobecause they thought they were going to be able to count on him Hersquos really their St Paulrdquo Therersquos a fighterrsquos bounce to Genslerrsquos step who is someone who clearly enjoys mixing it up He works on the ninth floor of a nondescript office building ten blocks from the White House but almost never takes the elevator even this past autumn while he was still recovering from a latenight fall in his bedroom that left him with a punctured lung and several cracked ribs Hersquos a longdistance runner and has raised three daughters on his own since losing his wife to cancer in 2006 ldquoThe president asked me out of 300 million Americans to do this jobrdquo he tells me ldquoI feel like the luckiest man in the worldrdquo

He is also a man under siege That much was obvious in the guided tour he gave me of what I came to see as a kind of Hall of Shamemdasha corridor near his office lined with framed photos of his predecessors None still work at the CFTC Gensler said but itrsquos amazing how often he sees many of them He nodded his chin toward a photo of Michael Dunn his immediate predecessor as CFTC chair Dunn now works for Patton Boggs a lobbying giant whose clients include Goldman Sachs and Citigroup two of the largest derivatives profiteers The man in the next photo is Walter Lukken acting chair of the CFTC for the final eighteen months of George W Bushrsquos presidency Lukken is ldquoaround all the timerdquo Gensler said as president and CEO for the Futures Industry Association which describes itself as ldquothe only association representative of all organizations that have an interest in the listed derivatives marketsrdquo Bushrsquos first CFTC chair James Newsome is cofounder of Delta Strategy a lobbying firm that provides clients with ldquoinnovative solutions to their regulatory concernrdquo Citadel Investments and DE Shaw two large hedge funds that invest in derivatives are among those paying Newsome and his partner retainers of 120000 and 160000 a year respectively Jon Corzinersquos old firm MF Global was good for another 110000 in the two years leading up to its spectacular implosion in 2011		
Gensler pointed to another two recent commissioners One resigned partway through a fiveyear term to join Patton Boggs and now runs his own lobbying shop the other also took a job with the industry before he had finished his term Gensler stepped back from the wall and counted fully threequarters of those who had served as CFTC commissioners over the past decade are among the noisy crowd of lobbyists beseeching him every day to soften the proposed derivatives rules delay their implementation or simply chuck them out altogether		
The industryrsquos influence extends to the CFTCrsquos current commissioners as well As chair of the CFTC Gensler runs the daytoday operations of the agency But hersquos still only one vote on a fiveperson commission that must decide on policy issues ranging from the small within how many seconds does a registered derivatives dealer need to post the price a customer paid to the large does DoddFrank require the CFTC to establish position limits or can its commissioners choose to do nothing The commission is made up of three members from the presidentrsquos party and two from the opposition One of the commissionrsquos current Republican appointees worked as a staffer for one of financial reformrsquos most outspoken foes Senator Mitch McConnell the other previously served as a lobbyist for a swaps and derivatives trade association Gensler could count on the vote of Bart ldquoQuadrakillrdquo Chilton who once ripped into Goldman Sachs and Citigroup for duping their own customers asking ldquoDid these guys go to school at Screw Urdquo But the commissionrsquos third Democrat during the critical first fifteen months after DoddFrank passed was Michael Dunn a regulator so industryfriendly that he would resign his seat in October 2011 and join the legions at Patton Boggs working to thwart Genslerrsquos efforts

	So how does the quadrakill begin With Congress says Bart Chilton For example a lobbyist for one of the big trade groups will complain to a friendly ally in the House that the CFTC is moving too fast or ignoring its warnings So then the treasury secretary receives a formal complaint signed by this or that House committee chair imploring him to intervene before Gensler inadvertently finalizes a rule that sends half the derivatives jobs overseas DoddFrank expanded Genslerrsquos mandate exponentially his agency is slated to go from monitoring 40 trillion in transactions each year to something closer to 300 trillion And the very first bill Republicans introduced after taking over the House in the 2010 midtermsmdashHR 1mdashwas a measure that would have cut the CFTCrsquos funding by onethird ldquoAnything we can do to slow down deter or impede their ability to engage in this oppressive overregulationrdquo Senator McConnell explained in 2011 ldquowould be good for our countryrdquo Congress has summoned Gensler to testify on Capitol Hill fiftyone times over the past four yearsmdashmore than a visit per month since his February 2009 confirmation hearing		
Wall Streetrsquos primary beachhead for fighting DoddFrank has been the House Committee on Financial Services chaired until recently by the Wall Streetndashfriendly Spencer Bachus ldquoRegulators are there to serve the banksrdquo thatrsquos what Bachus an Alabama Republican said shortly after it was announced that he would replace Barney Frank as the committeersquos new chair at the start of 2011 The Republicans have introduced dozens of DoddFrankrelated bills and almost all of them had been given a hearing in a Financial Services subcommittee ldquoFundraising billsrdquo Mierzwinski calls themmdashlegislation proposed in his view mainly to entice the industry to keep writing campaign checks to committee members The bills that have consumer advocates feeling especially nervous are those being presented as benign changes to an overly complex law Theyrsquore sold as technical fixes Dennis Kelleher says ldquobut what theyrsquore really about is creating loopholes big enough for the industry to drive a Mack truck throughrdquo Financial Services and its various subcommittees held more than sixtyfive hearings investigating various elements of DoddFrank in just the first two years after Republicans took control of the House		
You do for the industry and the industry does for you In 2012 Bachus fended off a primary challenge from his right and then faced his first Democratic challenger in more than a decade The 27 million in campaign contributions he raisedmdashmore than ten times the combined take of his three opponentsmdashallowed him to win easily And more than a third of Bachusrsquos contributions came from the socalled FIRE industries finance insurance and real estate which fall under his committeersquos purview The money also poured into Bachusrsquos political action committee Growth and Prosperitymdash25 million since 2007 according to OpenSecretsorgmdashwhich he in turn funneled back into the party and to his colleagues in the House Yet the House leadership would replace Bachus after one term with Jeb Hensarling a Texas Republican so hardline that hersquos decided to ban the CFPBrsquos Richard Cordray from testifying before the committee because he questions the presidentrsquos right to have named him in the first place

Genslerrsquos OpenDoor Transparency
	ensp
	The financial industry started huddling in meetings even before DoddFrank was signed into law So too did Gensler who was determined to prepare his agency for the assault he knew was coming Well before Congress had finalized DoddFrank he and his top people created thirty working groups inside the CFTC each focused on a different aspect of the bill Gensler the Goldman Sachs alum would take an investment bankerrsquos approach making each team leader responsible for a missed deadline or botched report The day before the DoddFrank signing ceremony Gensler gathered his team leaders and told them theyrsquod have just ten days to submit a memo laying out the key challenges they faced in implementing their piece of the puzzle Theyrsquod have until the end of Augustmdashfive weeksmdashto rework that plan after receiving feedback Congress had given them twelve months to finalize sixty rules and even if that deadline was absurdly ambitious Gensler wouldnrsquot let anyone say he hadnrsquot tried		
Early on Gensler announced that he would meet with anyone in the financial industry who requested his time He recuses himself from meetings with Goldman reps who meet with his top deputies instead The catch was this his agency would publish every visitorrsquos name on its website along with a synopsis of what was discussed ldquoThere was a lot of grumbling for a week or two but they got over itrdquo Gensler says The resulting calendar offers a startling glimpse into the kind of access the industry is given in Washington these days the CFTCrsquos records show that Goldman had thirtyone meetings in the first five months after DoddFrank became law or more than one a week Morgan Stanley another huge derivatives player had twenty meetings As Gensler describes them every meeting felt more or less the same ldquoInvariably theyrsquod all start off lsquoWersquore all for reformrsquo but then itrsquos lsquoBut wersquore concerned that you donrsquot appreciate a rule will have this unintended consequencersquordquo he says ldquoOr theyrsquod say something like lsquoWe need to clarify thisrsquo which usually meant they want an exception because it threatened a piece of their businessrdquo		
Gensler recognized that his opendoor policy would favor industry While Lisa Donner and Ed Mierzwinski and the Consumer Federationrsquos Barbara Roper were as free to walk through that same open door as the industry representatives they were all pretty much armies of one Indeed a single private equity firm BlackRock Inc logged more meetings with the CFTC in those crucial first five months after DoddFrankrsquos passage than the top four consumer advocates unions and investor protection groups combined To date the CFTC has held more than 2000 meetings inside the agency almost all with the industry and its highly paid representatives

The CFTC started publishing draft rules nine months after DoddFrankrsquos passage offering another chance for the industry to muck up the works This was the ldquocomments letterrdquo part of the process Again consumer advocates and union representatives were free to share their views on whatever the CFTC was proposing but their lack of resources and boots on the ground meant picking their battles carefully The big banks hedge funds and financial trade associations by contrast would simply pay a law firm up to 100000 to research and comment on each proposed rule in letters that ran as long as 300 pages Savvy financial players know that the 1946 Administrative Procedures Act requires federal agencies to catalog the issues raised and spell out why they are accepting or rejecting each point The more pages submitted to the CFTC the more time it would take to methodically sift through every letter To date the CFTC has received more than 39000 reaction letters from the industry comprising roughly 1 million pages of commentary		
Scalia lsquoAn Absolute Bulldogrsquo

	And when Wall Street doesnrsquot winmdashwhen despite everything an agency writes a rule the industry doesnrsquot likemdashtherersquos always its secret weapon Eugene Scalia A partner at the powerhouse DC law firm Gibson Dunn amp Crutcher and the top lawyer in the Labor Department under George W Bush Scalia is a thinfaced version of his old man he has the same dark eyes and heavy brows the same perpetual five orsquoclock shadow Is he as smart as his dad I ask a congressional staffer whose boss was a key architect of DoddFrank ldquoProbably smarterrdquo the staffer responds		
Scalia filed his first DoddFrankrelated suit in September 2010mdashtwo months after the signing ceremony The lawsuit focused on a seemingly trivial matter a new SEC rule requiring publicly traded companies to pick up the costs of sending out voting materials not just for their own slate of candidates for the board of directors but for anyone nominated by at least 3 percent of the shareholders The change seemed one explicitly dictated by law but Scalia argued that the SECrsquos rule was ldquoarbitrary and capriciousrdquo and favored special interest investors like state and union pension funds The DC Court of Appeals a notoriously conservative body ruled against the SEC which chose not to appeal		
The ruling stirred up profound anxieties within the CFTC It wasnrsquot the ruling itself says Andrei Kirilenko the agencyrsquos chief economist so much as the courtrsquos rationale The court following Scaliarsquos technocratic argument found that the SEC had considered some but not all studies in its costbenefit analysis The judges revealed that they were troubled by the SECrsquos outofhand dismissal of one study in particularmdasha study funded it turned out by the Business Roundtable which was one of the two trade associations funding Scaliarsquos suit

The ruling hit like a punch to the gut ldquoThe SEC had been working pretty systematically through the rules but then when they lost that lawsuit everything just ground to a haltrdquo says the Consumer Federationrsquos Barbara Roper The SEC claimed to have devoted 21000 staff hours to writing this one simple directive It still had another ninetyplus rules to go And with this precedent every new rulemdashwhether issued by the SEC the CFTC the Federal Reserve or any other agencymdashwould require a massive costbenefit analysis Whereas the typical CFTC directive might have included several paragraphs of costbenefit analysis in the past says Kirilenko who left the agency at the end of last year for a teaching post at MIT eighty pages would now be the norm		
Yet even that wouldnrsquot be enough The costbenefit argument would be central to all seven of the DoddFrankrelated suits that Scalia has filed so far Four of those were filed against the CFTC including a successful challenge that has resulted at the moment in the ldquoposition limitsrdquo aspect of DoddFrank being left up in the air ldquoAn absolute bulldogrdquo Jim Collura says when asked to describe Scaliarsquos style in oral arguments over the CFTCrsquos positionlimits rule ldquoI thought he was going to karatechop the podium in halfrdquo The CFTC has appealed the ruling		
		
Nazareth and the lsquoDe Maximisrsquo Exception
	ensp
	Think of Annette Nazareth as the Democratic version of Scalia doing what she can to slow down DoddFrankrsquos implementation by other means Where Scalia barks at his adversaries Nazareth shares ldquolingering concernsrdquo She cajoles rather than criticizes Her reacutesumeacute includes stints with Lehman Brothers and Citigroup and almost a decade with the SEC before moving to Davis Polk amp Wardwell which counts every major bank as a client She would be late for our appointment because of a lastminute gathering in Genslerrsquos office There she and others were hoping to convince him to delay the implementation of a set of rules taking effect that week that would require the biggest banks and others to start registering as swap dealers But Gensler wouldnrsquot budge		
ldquoYou canrsquot win them allrdquo she says with a tight smile		
Nazarethrsquos offices look more or less like Scaliarsquos which is to say they stand in stark contrast to the Office Depot clearancesale look of their adversaries Nazareth works on the top floor of a twelvestory tower four blocks from the White House White orchids decorate the blondwood conference room where we meet and there is a carafe of freshbrewed coffee to enjoy as we sink into the rich leather chairs What about those who say shersquos working to hollow out DoddFrank I ask ldquoThatrsquos such a simplistic viewrdquo she answers Sure the CFTC SEC and other agencies are struggling to implement the law But thatrsquos because of the immense complexity of the task not the power of lobbyists and lawyers like herself As she sees it shersquos a kind of pro bono adviser to public servants ldquoA huge amount of our time is spent helping regulators understand how to achieve their goal in a more effective wayrdquo she says

Of course thatrsquos how shersquoll frame it counters Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets ldquoWall Street canrsquot say lsquoWersquore against Volcker because itrsquos going to kill our profits and mean smaller bonusesrsquo So instead itrsquos lsquoVolcker is going to kill the corporate bond marketrsquo or lsquoVolcker is going to wreck the economyrsquordquo The true genius of Annette Nazareth and advocates like her he adds is their ability to make it sound like theyrsquore helpingmdashall the while turning a simple new rule into one that stretches for 200 pages creating more carveouts and exceptions		
And then therersquos the fight over what insiders call the ldquode minimis exceptionrdquo which found Kelleher crossing swords with Nazareth and some of her biggest clients The question confronting the CFTCmdashas well as the SEC which is responsible for a small sliver of the derivatives marketmdashwas this Who would need to register as a dealer in order to sell derivatives in the new open markets that DoddFrank was enabling The original proposal on the table was for a ldquode minimisrdquo exception of 100 million only if your annual derivatives revenue topped 100 million would you have to go through the expense and bother of registering and then complying with a strict regulation regimen But then came all those reasonable arguments from the likes of Nazareth and the exemption was inflated to the point of absurdity a threshold of 8 billion which would shrink to 3 billion after three years prompting Kelleher to call it the ldquode maximisrdquo exception		
ldquoOnly in Washington DCrdquo Kelleher says ldquocan you get a lsquode minimisrsquo exemption of 8 billionrdquo		
lsquoThe Beast Hasnrsquot Been Killed Yetrsquo

	Although the CFTC is further along in its work than the other agencies that only underscores how much work remains to be done on DoddFrank nearly three years after its passage The CFTC has finalized forty of its sixty rules according to the DoddFrank Progress Report which Nazarethrsquos firm publishes each month That leaves a lot of rules that still need to be finalized before therersquos a workable derivatives market Still compared with the other agencies the CFTC has proved to be a speed demon The SEC has barely finalized onethird of its rules and the various bank regulators the Fed the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are faring even worse As a group theyrsquove failed to publish draft language for onethird of their portfolio of assignments and have finalized only 27 percent of its rules So while a new Volcker Rule might not have prevented an embarrassment like JPMorganrsquos ldquoLondon Whalerdquo the bank probably wouldnrsquot have lost 6 billion on the deal and the regulators could have potentially seen what was happening sooner

Since January banks and others have been filing the requisite paperwork to establish themselves as registered swaps dealers But there wonrsquot be a market in which to do business until the CFTCrsquos fiveperson commission finalizes the relevant rules There are also big policy issues to be worked out not the least of which relates to how the CFTC treats the foreign subsidiaries of USbased banks Can Citigroup simply run some of its derivatives book out of the Cayman Islands as it was doing in 2008 thereby avoiding DoddFrank by shifting its derivatives business offshore The answer right now is yes it canmdashand thatrsquos what the answer will be until the CFTC definitively says otherwise		
But the champions of financial reform are worried less about the CFTC and more about Congress and the courts Gensler can argue that the CFTC must poke its nose into the foreign subsidiaries of USbased banks because American taxpayers will be on the hook if one of those banks blows itself up But even if Genslerrsquos side wins that logic may not hold up in court More immediately there are five derivativesrelated bills currently working their way through the House Financial Services Committee that would introduce ldquohuge loopholesrdquo into DoddFrank says John Parsons a senior lecturer at MITrsquos Sloan School of Management and coauthor of the popular Betting the Business blog nbspMaybe theyrsquore just ldquofundraising billsrdquo to use Mierzwinskirsquos phrase But Parsons is worried that they might be more given ldquoall those lobbyists swarming Capitol Hill trying to pick off individual Democrats now that the heat from the crisis is overrdquo		
Meanwhile the stock market is hitting new heights and the banks are roaring back selling the very same ldquorisky amalgams of mortgages and loansrdquo they sold during the boom The New York Times reported on its front page in April and minting more ldquoarcanesounding financial productsrdquo like the kind that doomed the economy only five years ago And so despite DoddFrank we are still threatened by the same dangers ldquoItrsquos like a horror movie and the beast hasnrsquot been killed yetrdquo Parsons says ldquoYou canrsquot be too triumphant just because the first blows had the beast weakenedrdquo		
Our blogger Greg Kaufmann writes that bank accountability activists continue to send a clear message to the big banks ldquoYou can run but you canrsquot hiderdquonbspAnd one of our Nation Builders has posted an excerpt from Neil Barofskyrsquos Bailout An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street addressing the serious limitations of DoddFrank bill
