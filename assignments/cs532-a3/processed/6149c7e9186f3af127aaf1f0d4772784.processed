Tom Brady might have more Super Bowl Rings but I refuse to have less hair Manning said to CBS Sports 
The Denver Broncos quarterback was named in a list of athletes of procuring HGH human growth hormone but Manning said it was a mistake and he received hair growth hormone

  





  

I started losing my hair in my 20s said Manning My wife told me about this miracle hair drug from China We called the number and with help from our Chinese food delivery guy we had the hair growth product sent to our house
I applied the cream to my scalp and let it stand for six hours a day seven days a week After a cycle I didnt notice a difference so I went to Hair Club For Men
