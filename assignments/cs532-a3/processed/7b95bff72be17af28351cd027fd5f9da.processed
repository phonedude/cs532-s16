											Leon HalipGetty ImagesRichard Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers catching Aaron Rodgersrsquos seventyyard pass to win the game against the Detroit Lions December 3 20151Of the many sayings attributed to Vince Lombardi the legendary coach of the Green Bay Packers the one that seems most relevant to football today is not about winning the pursuit of excellence or the importance of will and character but rather this ldquoFootball is not a contact sport it is a collision sportrdquoCollisions are the essence of football They are intended to occur on every play in every game Football Lombardi would say comes down to blocking and tackling Every block and tackle is a collision and every collision could bring some measure of pain When Lombardi was a boy in Brooklyn his father Harry a tough little man who ran a butcher shop pounded into him the notion that pain was all in his mindThe truth is that Lombardi himself had a low pain threshold He was often disabled with injuries when he was a member of the Fordham line romanticized in the 1930s as the Seven Blocks of Granite But like many effective leaders he drew on an understanding of his own weaknesses as a means of eliminating them in others When he was a prep coach at St Cecilia High School in Englewood New Jersey he would line up across from his young players and order them to charge at him while he bellowed ldquoHit me Hit merdquo At Green Bay Lombardi would cackle with delight during training camp when it came time for the oneonone collision drill known as the nutcrackerI grew up in Wisconsin during the 1960s when Lombardirsquos Packers were winning five championships in nine seasons and later wrote a biography of him which might explain why although baseball is my preferred game the Packers are my favorite team in any sport The seasonal progression from radiant fall Sundays to frostbite playoff games in the darkening winter and the superstitions that come with watching the Packers are part of my emotional life bringing joy and anguish and if that is pathetic it is a condition I share with millions of National Football League fans But my attachment to football has been loosened by an increasing sense of guilt about whether I am complicit in supporting an unacceptably debilitating and duplicitous enterprise Americarsquos superpower game has never been more popular yet evidence against it is amassing on many fronts none more troubling than what science now says about the longterm ramifications of those collisions Irsquove wondered whether I could resolve the conflict between my attraction to the game and concern about what it does On a larger scale Irsquove wondered whether football could repair itself and be made saferIn a search for answers I studied a diverse collection of books articles transcripts and films about football They included three books that considered the physical sociological and financial aspects of the sport to support their thesesmdashSteve Almondrsquos manifesto Against Football Gregg Easterbrookrsquos response The Gamersquos Not Over In Defense of Football and Gilbert Gaulrsquos BillionDollar Ball a deeply reported look into the corporatization of the college game and how it can take precedence over academic concernsThe rest dealt mostly with the neurological effects that football collisions can have on the brain Two were films the wellpublicized Concussion a Hollywood movie starring Will Smith as the Pittsburgh pathologist who discovered a neurodegenerative disease in the brain tissue of deceased football players that came to be known as CTE chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the notyetreleased documentary Requiem for a Running Back about Rebecca Carpenterrsquos quest to understand her troubled father Lew Carpenter who played in the NFL with Lombardirsquos Packers fiftyfive years ago and suffered from CTE I also read transcripts of television interviews on the topic of football brain trauma conducted by Charlie Rose and PBSrsquos Frontline and the essential writings of Steve Fainaru and his brother Mark FainaruWada especially League of Denial a book that documented two decades of obfuscation and deceit by the NFL in dealing with brain injuries2Before all else football must be identified for what it has become far beyond the blocking and tacklingmdasha colossal entertainment business that benefits from an economic system tilted in its favorThe NFL operating as a monopoly exempt from antitrust legislation brings in 11 billion a year The owners have been reported to pay their handpicked commissioner Roger Goodell an annual salary of over 35 million Most of the money comes from television Easterbrook notes that on the list of the mostwatched television events in American history the Super Bowl holds the top twenty spots Sunday Night Football on NBC has been the toprated show on any channel since 2011 and ESPNrsquos Monday Night Football has been the numberone cable show since 2006The football games of the major college teams and conferences are not far behind as businesses even as they enjoy the benefits of nonprofit tax status Several conferences such as the Big Ten have their own lucrative television networks and as Gaul writes ldquoare operated like entertainment divisions with CEOstyle executives and celebrity coaches collecting Wall Streetndashlevel salariesrdquo At the University of Oregon known as ldquoNike Urdquo because of the largesse of one billionaire alumnus Phil Knight founder of the shoe company the equivalent of more than 180000 was spent on each football player by Gaulrsquos estimate The ldquostudentathletesrdquo are tutored in the ldquoTaj Mahal of academic servicesrdquo buildings a 42 million glassandsteel modernist structure offlimits to other students and trained in a Football Performance Center that reminded Gaul of an upscale shopping mall replete with plush Ferrari leather meeting seats and locker rooms with ldquofloortoceiling glass walls and marble flooring imported from Italyrdquo The academic honors program at Oregon is housed in a basementJust as with movie stars pop idols and other bigtime entertainers any comparison of NFL salaries to those of other professions can be depressing In 2013 according to Almond the Minnesota Vikings paid a defensive end 1 million per game ldquoto maul opposing quarterbacksrdquo For that same price communities in a state then facing a budget deficit could have hired 474 elementary school teachers or 661 police officers Fans tend to accept the disparity as a fact of life in our marketdriven celebrityloving society They fund most of it not only by writing monthly checks for cable sports channels and buying game tickets and team merchandise but also indirectly through the tapping of public funds and granting of tax breaks so that wealthy owners can profit from new and better stadiumsIn Seattle where Seahawks fans are admiringly called the 12th Man because of the decibel level of their relentless cheering nearly three quarters of the construction funds for CenturyLink Field came from Washington State taxpayers ldquoThe owner Paul Allen pays the state 1 million per year in lsquorentrsquo and collects most of the 200 million generatedrdquo Almond writes ldquoIf you are wondering how to become like Allen one of the richest humans on earth negotiating such a lease would be a good startrdquoAll of the above is accepted as troublesome by Easterbrook Almond and Gaul despite their disparate conclusions about the fate of football Gaul with his focus on college football has the most provocative perspective on what comes next The monetization of a superficially amateur sport has made poorly funded programs like those of New Mexico State or AlabamaBirmingham poorer and rich programs like Ohio State and Oregon richer When Gaul asked the commissioners of twelve conferences including the Big Ten and the PAC conference in western states if they were worried about their bubble bursting ldquothey only laughed in responserdquo This was the gilded age of college football Gaul concluded but ldquothe thing about gilded ages is they eventually collapse on themselvesrdquoHow might they collapse Whatever the football community does about making the game safer Gaul saw signs of another problem looming aheadmdashthe unstoppable force of technology Schools that now profit from football shouldbe concerned about the disruptive implications of tablets cell phones and other gadgets not yet imaginedhellipand the younger generation of fans who arenrsquot nearly as committed to the livegame experience as their parents and grandparents werehellip Even students at mighty Alabama are leaving at halftime and not coming back It is that little portable screen they keep fiddling with to distract themselvesIn their comments on the merits of the game Easterbrook and Almond draw on a wide range of arguments but in the end the crucial divide involves brain trauma Easterbrookrsquos assessment is summarized in his title The Gamersquos Not Over even if the NFL is ldquobroken and needs reformrdquo He calls it ldquothe quintessential American sport a magnificent incarnation of our national characterrdquo and praises its aesthetic beauty the way it brings together fans of disparate races and incomes and how it provides an outlet for emotion and manliness in an artificial universe where unlike the real world nothing terrible occursThe problem Easterbrook argues is not at the pro level but earlier in ldquoyouth footballrdquomdashplayed by adolescentsmdashand on high school teams where the vast majority of concussions occur in brains that are more vulnerable There are about two million boys playing youth tackle football and another 11 million on high school teams while there are about two thousand in the NFL Easterbrook would prohibit tackle football for kids below a certain age He believes that changes in NFL rules and improvements in equipment will diminish the likelihood of longterm brain trauma for the pro players He advisesYes keep watching the NFL The games are fabulous the players know the risks and are well compensated I watch the NFL on television avidly and attend many games with enthusiasm I never feel the slightest compunction You shouldnrsquot eitherAlmond a reformed Oakland Raiders fanatic struggled with conflicted feelings for years but finally concluded that ldquoour allegiance to football legitimizes and even fosters within us a tolerance for violence greed racism and homophobiardquo Where Easterbrook sees the sport as that magnificent incarnation of the American character Almond asksWhat does it mean that the most popular and unifying form of entertainment in Americahellipfeatures giant muscled men mostly African American engaged in a sport that causes many of them to suffer brain damageAnd he sees no reason to trust that the NFL will clean up the game ldquoAs fans we want to believe that league officials will choose the righteous path over the profitable one This is nonsense and always has beenrdquo3In the debate about football and brain trauma Mike Websterrsquos dead brain started it all in a sense and Chris Borlandrsquos living brain intensified the discussion Separated by forty years their stories weave together through the writings and films I examined on the subjectldquoIron Mikerdquo Webster was a Hall of Fame center who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers won four Super Bowl rings and died in 2002 at age fifty By then he was a broken man who lived in a pickup truck estranged from his family shocking himself with a Taser and attaching his teeth with superglue It was his brain tissue that Dr Bennet Omalumdashthe main character in Concussionmdashexamined at the Allegheny County Coronerrsquos Office in Pittsburgh leading to the discovery of CTE Flashbacks depicting Websterrsquos tormented last days as portrayed by actor David Morse are among the moviersquos most telling scenesAs Concussion unfolds the NFL responds to Dr Omalursquos findings about Websterrsquos brain by calling him a quack and claiming that the CTE discovery is bad science The campaign against him continues even after he documents strikingly similar damage in the brain tissue of other troubled former players who died too young This reaction became part of a pattern When Alan Schwarz of The New York Times started writing about traumatic brain injuries and football Paul Tagliabue then the commissioner said dismissively that this ldquois one of those pack journalism issues franklyrdquo The NFL formed its own study committee stacked with doctors affiliated with the league As League of Denial documents the goal was to obfuscate the problem Theirs was the junk science not Omalursquos One scientific paper declared ldquoProfessional football players do not sustain frequent repetitive blows to the brain on a regular basisrdquo Webster endured more than 70000 blows during his long careerChris Borland was an inside linebacker who played one brilliant season for the San Francisco 49ers then retired in March 2015 at age twentyfour after studying the potential longterm effects the game might have on his brain ldquoI want to be seventyfive and healthy if possiblerdquo he told Rebecca Carpenter in her documentary One magazine labeled him ldquothe most dangerous man in footballrdquoLombardi and Wisconsin connect the two Webster grew up on a potato farm in northern Wisconsin revering the Packers during the 1960s while they were winning five championships He went on to play center at the University of WisconsinndashMadison before reaching the NFL League of Denial opens with a scene of Webster at Pittsburghrsquos training camp as a slow and undersized fifthround draft choice in 1974 proving himself by excelling at the brutal nutcracker drill that Lombardi made infamous Borland whose family came from Wisconsin and moved to Ohio grew up idolizing Lombardi After my book appeared he sent me a local newspaper photograph showing him in sixth grade dressed as Lombardi in a comically oversized camelhair coat and stocking cap presenting a book report on my biography of the coachLike Webster Borland played college football at Wisconsin His roommate was from Rhinelander where Webster went to high school Webster was a hero in the Wisconsin football pantheon when Borland played there His Hall of Fame plaque hung outside the locker room Borland took Websterrsquos determined approach to the game as the model of a way to prove himself but though football was important to him it was not the only thing Reporters in Madison considered Borland an unusually thoughtful and independent athlete In 2011 he joined the mass protests at the state capitol against Governor Scott Walkerrsquos antiunion agendaAt training camp during his first season with the 49ers Borland suffered a concussion and from then on even as he excelled in games he thought about retiring He made the decision after reading League of Denial and consulting with Robert A Stern an expert on brain trauma and a professor of neurology at Boston University By then there was no debate about the validity of CTE though it could only be diagnosed posthumously by examining brain tissue Without acknowledging guilt the NFL had settled a classaction lawsuit filed by thousands of former players charging that the league for years had covered up what it knew about traumatic brain injuries Although the players were awarded a total allotment of nearly 1 billion spread out over twenty years the deal was largely considered a win for the owners to collect the money the players had to waive the right to further litigationSternrsquos colleague Ann McKee had discovered CTE in the brains of scores of deceased football players of several generations including Frank Gifford a member of the Hall of Fame who died in his eighties and Junior Seau who killed himself at fortythree But it was Webster whom Borland could not get off his mind when he decided that the risk of playing was not worth the reward The 49ers responded by sending him a bill to repay much of his signing bonus He still owes about 300000 A few months after he retired he visited his old high school coach in Ohio who asked him whether he could teach his young players a safer way to tackle Borland politely declined explaining ldquoI think thatrsquos a really difficult thing to dordquoEric WycoffYou Gotta Love LLCRebecca Carpenter director of Requiem for a Running Back looking at the brain of her father football player Lew Carpenter with neuropathologist Ann McKeeThe stories of Webster and Borland and Dr Omalu all appear in the documentary Requiem for a Running Back along with several powerful encounters that Rebecca Carpenter and her producer Sara Dee had with aging players and their families No scene in the dramatization Concussion can match the agony of watching John Hilton who played tight end in the NFL from 1964 to 1974 lose his train of thought his eyes watering a look of sheer desperation washing over him as he tries to explain his mental condition or the pain on the face of the wife of Mike Pyle a center for the 1963 champion Chicago Bears as she tells Carpenter ldquoOne day you wake up and think I donrsquot have a husband anymore Hersquos sitting next to me buthelliprdquo The current estimates are that nearly 30 percent of all NFL players will suffer some form of dementianbspover the next sixtyfivenbspyears Most players unlike Borland will still say it is worth the risk But David Hovda the head of UCLArsquos Brain Injury Research Center explained to Carpenter ldquoBrain injury does not happen to one person It happens to an entire familyrdquoRebecca Carpenter had spent years trying to understand her father Lew who grew up near the cotton fields of the Arkansas Delta started as a running back at the University of Arkansas and became a football lifer ten years as a player a coach for thirtyone more On the field Rebecca said ldquohe was beautiful and I mean really really beautifulrdquo but at home his anger and withdrawal had cast a shadow over her childhood and later became so pronounced that his wife after a long and loving marriage felt no choice but to leave himWhen he died at age seventyeight in 2010 his family received an inquiry from Ann McKee the neuropathologist in Boston She had read Carpenterrsquos obituary saw that he ostensibly had never suffered a concussion during his career and asked whether his brain could be examined as a control in the CTE studies The family agreed and months later Rebecca was in Boston looking through a microscope at the brown strands of tau protein that had riddled her fatherrsquos diseased brain tissue McKee said to her ldquoOn a scale of one to four four being the worst your father was a fourrdquoSince it cannot be diagnosed in living players CTE is not a fully understood disease Its symptoms appear to vary widely from severe dementia to depression to bursts of anger But Lew Carpenterrsquos brain reinforced what leading neuroscientists now believemdashthat it is not severe concussions so much as the repetitive subconcussive blows that football players endure over a career that are more often the cause the toll of thousands of collisions and jarring movements that shake the brain inside the skull This calls into question whether the NFLrsquos concussion protocols and changes in rules can fix things As Susan Margulies a concussion expert at the University of Pennsylvania explained to Charlie Rose no helmet has been devised that can ldquoeffectively reduce the rotational acceleration that sloshing within the head thatrsquos happening in the brain itselfrdquoIn late November during the middle of my research I announced to my wife that I was ldquooff footballrdquo The cumulative effect of what I had read and viewed seemed too damning for me to continue as a fan But this decision also happened to coincide with a Packers loss to the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving night A team that had started the season 6ndash0 was now 7ndash4 and it was exasperating to watch them struggle Was I ldquooff footballrdquo or conveniently using my newfound knowledge as a rationalization to avoid the pain I spent the following days with anything but football no college games on Saturday no NFL on Sunday or Monday night I imagined what it would be like to be Garry Wills who once told me that he had never watched ESPNGreen Bayrsquos next game was the following Thursday night against the Detroit Lions I tried to resist watching but gave in clicking on the television in our hotel room for the start of the game With the Packers trailing 17ndash0 before halftime off went the set This served me right for being weak I said to myself An hour later unable to sleep I checked my cell phone and saw that the score was 23ndash21 DetroitNo debate now On went the television and I watched the final tense minutesmdashthe Lionsrsquo completion on third and long that seemed to clinch the game the Packers getting the ball back one final time with less than a halfminute remaining the desperate multilateral play that seemed to end it all as Aaron Rodgers the Packersrsquo quarterback was tackled with the clock reading 0000 the penalty flag against a Detroit lineman for yanking Rodgersrsquos face mask allowing Green Bay one last untimed play the snap Rodgers retreating and feinting left barely avoiding a sack rolling out to his right gathering momentum as he approached the line of scrimmage and launched a remarkable gungho spiral the ball arcing as high as a punt nearly scraping the rafters of indoor Ford Field before descending toward the end zone seventy yards downfield and floating into the hands of the felicitously named Richard Rodgers who had turned and backpedaled and jumped high to make the catch in front of a scrum of teammates and opposing defensive backs HE CAUGHT IT HE CAUGHT IT WE WON WE WON I screamed waking up my wife if not the entire tenth floor of the hotel Easterbrookrsquos The Gamersquos Not Over took on a new meaningI quit smoking cold turkey thirty years ago this was more difficult Of all the people I had come across during my research on football Chris Borland was the one I admired most I wanted to support him in every way I could yet he had played and I had only watched and now I could not yet bring myself to stop watching even though that made me feel less than virtuous I was not alone with these conflicted impulses Ann McKee who had studied scores of diseased football brains at Boston University acknowledged that she remained a fan ldquoI have like these two facesrdquo she told Almond as he was making his case against football McKee grew up in Appleton Wisconsin a Packers fan like me Among the artifacts in her office was a bobblehead doll of Aaron RodgersAnd what of Rebecca Carpenter Was she off football now Yes she wrote to me and in truth it never gave her much pleasure This said she acknowledged how marvelous it could be ldquoThat Aaron Rodgers pass with zero seconds on the clock Who didnrsquot think that was beautiful Holy shit itrsquos an amazing gamerdquo
