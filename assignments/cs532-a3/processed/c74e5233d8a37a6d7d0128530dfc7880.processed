Like a big star who undergoes a few nips and tucks before a big moment in front of millions CBS is freshening up the CBS Sports logo before its Super Bowl 50 closeup on tomorrow The logo which debuted in 1981 has been updated for the first time in 35 years
CBS Sports8217 new logo which the network rolled out this week in the leadup to Super Bowl 50 is part of a new onair graphics look for CBS Sports and CBS Sports Network 8220There8217s no higherprofile vehicle to launch something like that so that8217s why we chose Super Bowl week8221 said Sean McManus chairman of CBS Sports and executive producer of CBS8217s Super Bowl 50 coverage 8220The graphics redesign was something we talked about for two or three years It had been almost 10 years since we did a graphics redesign and so all the insert graphics the animations the fullpage graphics will all be brandnew8221 
As for the updated logo McManus said 8220We decided that we should make our logo a bit more contemporary and a bit more conducive to fitting in with the new graphics factors So we looked at 125 different logos and settled on about a dozen that we liked In the end it really was unanimousthis was the best one It was sleek It was modern but it also felt traditional in some ways It was simple and for us it just said CBS Sports8221
McManus told Adweek in our Super Bowl issue that he doesn8217t feel pressure to top NBC8217s record ratings for last year8217s Super Bowl telecast 1144 million total viewers a 497 rating in adults 1849 8220That8217s more of an industry thing than anything else8221 he said 8220Basically it8217s bragging rights and if you don8217t get it it8217s still going to be the mostwatched telecast of the year8221
As McManus plans CBS8217s seven hours of Super Bowl pregame coverage the game itself and the postgame show he8217s also planning for contingencies like the blackout that hit New Orleans8217 Superdome in 2013 when CBS last aired the game
8220We have three different sources of power this year which we haven8217t had before8221 he said 8220We8217ve got UPS an uninterrupted power source which is basically a great big huge battery We8217ve got dieselpowered generators and we8217ve got land or shore power coming from the stadium So we are covered at CBS 8230 We8217ll be better prepared this time around than we were last time8221
This story first appeared on Adweek with the headline CBS Sports Updates its Logo for the First Time in 35 Years Ahead of Super Bowl 50
