  Why quotNet Zero Energy
  Matters










  
    
Americans
spend more than 400 billion every year for electricity and natural gas for our homes and commercial buildings consuming more than 70 of all
thenbsp electricity used in the United States which is about 40 of our nations total energy
bill This also contributes almost 40 of the nations  carbon dioxide
emissions










  
    
By
standardizing on Net Zero
Energy and
upgrading existing commercial buildings to Net Zero
Energy the USA increases energy efficiency
and reduces the purchases of energy from all sources both foreign and domestic 










  
    
Net Zero Energy
Protects your Financial Health
The
average family spends 2200 each year on
the power and energy needed for their homes A Net Zero
Energy home
can reduce this amount by 80 to 100










  
    
Net Zero Energy
Protects your Health and the Environment

Did you know that buildings homes and commercial buildings are responsible
fornbsp










  
    

  
    almost
    40 of the our countrys  greenhouse gas emissionsnbsp
  
     18 of the nitrogen oxides
    emissionsnbsp
  
    55 of the sulfur dioxide emissionsnbsp

 These
harmful emissions are generated from the combustion of fossil fuels which cause acid rain
haze smog and cause breathingrespiratory problems for thousands of people By
increasing the energy efficiency of our countrys homes and commercial buildings
we reduce these harmful emissions while reducing our monthly utility and
transportation expenses Imagine never again receiving a monthly bill from your
electric power or natural gas utility companynbsp Having a Net Zero
Energy home
or business can do that or provide the option to quotcut the cordquot to
the electric company in the futurenbsp 
Every
new Net Zero
Energy  home or commercial building helps
our country reduce energyrelated  greenhouse gas emissions
There is a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
from fossil fuels of 17 by 2020 
Net Zero Energy
Protects Americas Economy and Leads to Energy Independence

The USA is still dependent on
foreign oilnbsp Each day the USA shifts the wealth of Americans to foreign
countries and foreign jobsnbsp With oil at 100bbl Americans send about
13 billion for the foreign oil we buy which adds up to almost 12 trillion
every year And thats also costing America thousands of jobs
Net Zero
Energy will help America become energy independent
create thousands of jobs in the USA and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
from insecure sources and from countries that do not agree with our countrys
leadership or policies










  
    
Building
and upgrading homes and commercial buildings to Net Zero
Energy with
less reduces the problems relating to an old inefficient electric power grid
Increased Net Zero
Energy homes and commercial
buildings also saves the need for building new central power plants running on
fossil fuels that are still highly inefficient at no more than 50
efficientnbsp










  
    

  
  What does a Net Zero Energy
  home or building look like










  
    
Net Zero
Energy homes and commercial
buildings can look like any other residential home hospital school or
commercial office building they do NOT have to be ugly or modern in appearance
to be Net Zero
Energynbsp










  
    
And
your present home or commercial building can be updated to Net Zero
Energy

                 The US Army announced April 19 2012 the locations for 8 new
  Army facilities that will be pilot
  Net Zero Energy installations  As part of the Armys overall effort to conserve
  resources net zero
energy installations will consume only as much energy as well as water 
  quotNet
Zero Waterquot  as they produce and eliminate solid waste to landfills

                 The announcement initiates the programmatic environmental analysis and planning process for the Armys Net Zero
Energy and Net Zero Water Installation Strategynbsp

US Army has identified 6 new Net Zero Energy pilot installations that will be
built as Net Zero Energy facilities plus 2 other installations
that will be Net Zero Energy and Net Zero Water  all to be built and online by 2020nbsp

The US Armys definition of quotnet zero energyquot is similar to that of
the industry which is a home building or facility quotgeneratesnbsp as much energy on site as it uses over the course of a yearquotnbsp
    The Armys pilot net zero energy installations
  are located at the following US Armys installations
  
    
                       Fort
      Detrick Md
    
      Fort Hunter
      Liggett Calif
    
      Kwajalein Atoll Republic of the Marshall Islands
    
      Parks Reserve Forces Training Area Calif
    
      Sierra Army Depot Calif
    
      West Point NY
  
  Additionally the Oregon Army National Guard volunteered to pilot a unique
  as well as challenging Net Zero Energy Initiative which includes all of their installations across the state
  Their strategy will be included in the environmental analysis
  
  
  
What is a Net Zero Energy
Building sm
A
Net Zero Energy Building
sm 
produces as much energy as it uses over the course of a yearnbsp
A
Net Zero Energy Building
smnbsp is very energy efficient The remaining low energy needs are typically met with
onsite renewable energynbsp
First of
all understand that there is no
such thing as a quotzero energy buildingquot EVERY building uses energy or
you may as well be in a cavenbspnbsp
The important
considerations arenbsp
1nbsp How efficient is
the buildingnbspnbsp
2nbsp How much energy
does the building use and how efficiently is it usednbspnbsp
3nbsp How much
renewable energy and clean power is generated by the buildings own onsite renewable energy
system
4nbsp What are
the utility companys prices for the excess power generated and sent to the
grid
5nbsp How difficult is
it to interconnect the renewable energy system of the building with the utility
companys powerlineselectric grid




  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    




      
      
      
      
      
  
      
      


















      
      
      
      
  
      
      

  
  
  
  
  
  What
is quotNet
  Positive Energyquot
  
  
      










  
    




  
  
Net
Positive
Energy   when applied to a home or commercial building means
the home or business generates more power and energy than they consume when
measured on an annual basisnbsp
The excess power and energy can then be soldtransferredexported to the grid or
to their surrounding neighbors in order to offset and eventually replace the
quotdirty brown electronsquot generated from highly polluting and
inefficient quotcentral power
plantsquot

  Net
Positive
Energy   A quotpositive energy buildingquot
  produces more energy from renewable energy sources than it consumesnbsp
  This surplus energy can then be sold to produce an income to a neighbor or
  exported to the electric grid for revenue or a credit see Net

The
founder of the Renewable Energy Institute REI was first involved in Net Zero
Energy     buildings and Solar
Trigeneration sm  
energy systems in 2001
 2002nbsp This started with familyowned real estate developments in
Northern and Southern Californianbsp This interest was accelerated when REIs
founder was introduced to the President of a solar company in Los Angeles and
their client the Audubon Nature Center at Debs Park Los Angeles that was
planning to build a new 5000 sf office and conference center Except the new
building for the Audubon Nature Center was about 12 mile from the end of the
power lines and a very costly extension of the power lines to their new facility
forced them to consider a solar solution When the Audubon Nature Centers new
5000 sf office and conference center was completed in 2003 the facility not
only featured the Solar
Trigeneration sm   energy
system  they were awarded one of the first Platinum LEED Awards by the USGBC 
and the powerlines were still 12 mile away To this day 100 of the power and
energy for the Audubon Nature Centers building is supplied by the Solar
Trigeneration sm  
energy system  whether at 12 noon or 12 midnitenbsp The Audubons facility
also includes a battery
energy storage  
 system for backup power generated by the Rooftop
PV  
 panels as well as a thermal energy storage system that stores the excess hot
water generated by the evacuated
tube collectors










  
    




  
These early projects led to more client inquiries and engagements with real
estate developers architects and building owners in Southern California
Louisiana and Texas and the advent of a growing Net Zero
Energy      industry along with Solar
Cogeneration smnbsp
amp Solar
Trigeneration sm
energy systems This culminated in a familyowned 200
Net Zero
Energy home real estate development
in Desert Hot Springs which has been approved but not yet constructednbsp 










  
    




During this time the REIs Founder
became a volunteer and Advisor
to the University of Texas Solar Decathlon Competition He coordinated the
donation of the same solar
thermal system used at the Audubon Nature Centers facility in Los Angeles for UTs entry in
the 2002 Solar Decathlon Competition in Washington DCnbsp UTs entry in the
Solar Decathlon Competition placed 1st in the  domestic hot water
competition
that year 2002 and 4th overall out of 20 universities that had enterednbsp










  
    




 In
2006 after Hurricane Kattrina devastated New Orleans the REI was
formed and several of the
REIs board members and a Professor from the University of Texas School of
Architecture formed a design team to enter the Brad PittGlobal Green Rebuild New Orleans Competitionnbsp
Our entry also focused on sustainable building solutions and materials as well
as the Net Zero
Energy      concepts incorporating once again a Solar
Trigeneration sm  
energy systemnbsp 










  
    




Today
the REI quotFlagshipquot has chartered the Renewable Energy Institute in
Florida with discussions to open REI state chapters in Arizona California
Hawaii Minnesota and Oregonnbsp










  
    




The
REI supports greater use of Net Zero Energy systems by architects builders homeowners and
owners of commercial buildings This includes quotupgradingquot homes and
commercial buildings to Net Zero Energynbsp The REI provides Net Zero Energy
advertising business development conferences ecommerce education marketing online
marketing public relations renewable energy sales and strategic marketing solutions for
architects builders cities colleges HVAC contractors Net Zero Energy developers real
estate developers and universities
