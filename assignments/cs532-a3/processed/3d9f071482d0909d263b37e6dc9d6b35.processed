						New Hampshire Superbowl 8211 GOPDebate With RealDonaldTrump Rubio2016 TedCruz 8211 There Will Be Blood				Update  Open thread  Brace for impact The New Hampshire GOP debate  800 ET  The 8220Live Free Or Die8221 state is now the 8220Do or Die8221 state
82128212821282128212821282128212821282128212821282128212
The 8220year of the monkey8220 on Monday  That dull football Superbowl on Sunday Bernie Sanders on Saturday Night Live Screw all that  Tonight is our Superbowl
We know next to nothing about sports  We know less about football American style and wouldn8217t mind knowing even less than that  But we do know that in football there are two teams and both teams develop an offensive strategy and a defensive strategy to achieve their tactical aims taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the respective players and generals coaches directing the armies teams and succeed in the strategic aim which is to score and win  
Football we suspect is like a military campaign in which the goal is to drop the bomb in the other team8217s most closely guarded spot  It8217s like ice hockey without the ice  It8217s like a chess game in which the goal is to kill the most closely guarded player 8211 the king  In other words football at its best is a weak silly insignificant diversion which pales in comparison to the death match brutality of politics  
Tonight the remaining GOP candidates for president meet in New Hampshire in advance of Tuesday8217s first in the nation primary election and battle with verbal swords to the death  The serious issues the nation faces should be paramount but they will also be weapons in this joust  There will be blood  
Tonight is very important because it is the last big chance the candidates have to sway the New Hampshire electorate  Unless you are a voter or candidate or unfortunately in Big Media your influence is relatively small  So once again we ask you put aside your personal preference for a candidate and play strategist  What would you do  
Assume you are on team Donald J Trump  What would you do  Attack Ted Cruz even though you pretty much have inflicted all the damage on him that is profitable at this point and more attacks only lead to Malthusian diminishing returns knowing Ben Carson will do that particular job 8211 or attack the risinginthepolls second place or third place Rubio or attack one of the other losers er candidates or play nice discuss only the issues and try to win the Nobel Peace Prize you have just been nominated for  What would you do  
Assume you are on team Marco Rubio  What would you do  Pretend to be very nice tout endorsements and hope niceness deflects or weakens potential incoming attacks and thereby with a defensive strategy try to continue to rise to a firm second place and secretly hope to rise to first place  Or attack first  Attack Cruz again  Or leave that to Ben Carson  Attack Jeb knowing Christie will come to his defense  Attack Barbara Bush  What would you do  
Assume you are on team Ted Cruz  What would you do  Attack Trump knowing he will hit back hard but since you know you will lose New Hampshire anyway the goal would be to prevent Trump from winning New Hampshire with an infuriating series of attacks in order to finish off Trump in New Hampshire so that you can move on to South Carolina without Trump in the race and therefore you can consolidate the 8220outsider8221 vote  Or attack Rubio in order to come in second and continue to pose a problem for Trump as well as smash Rubio8217s 321 strategy  Or attack one of the other er candidates denounce them as 8220establishment8221 and burnish your appeal to South Carolina  What would you do  
Assume you are on team John Kasich  What would you do  Attack Trump knowing he has bested you before  Attack Rubio who stands in your way to the silver position  Or attack Cruz for the same reasons  Or attack one of the other candidates for whom New Hampshire is the 8220do or die8221 state  For Governor Kasich it is do or die in New Hampshire and tonight is his last chance to buckeye the odds  What would you do
Assume you are on team Jeb Bush  What would you do  Prepare a smart answer for when Trump declares that 8220your mother has more energy than you do Jeb8221  Attack Trump as the number one target  Attack Rubio along with your ally Chris Christie and bring down that weasel  Attack one of the other candidates for whom New Hampshire is 8220do or die8221 or attack Ted Cruz even though Ben Carson has a better case to make against Cruz  Continue poking the mighty bull Donald Trump and get the horns again  Or attack your ally Chris Christie because well Christie blocks your way too  What would you do
Assume you are on team Chris Christie  What would you do  Understand that Trump is likely to win New Hampshire and that Rubio is the one that should lead the antiTrump battle tonight  Would you concentrate all your attacks on that highheeled bubble boy weasel from Florida  Stand with Jeb if Jeb is attacked or keep your mouth shut and watch Jeb suffer as the life leaves his limp body  Attack Kasich  Attack Cruz  Get on the floor and roll all over every other candidate squashing them all to death  What would you do
That last Dem debate on repulsive MSNBC got few eyeballs to turn in  Tonight8217s bloodbath is on the ABC network so not only will the interest be high so will the availability of the broadcast  The debate tonight is at 800 pm ET  Eight O8217Clock  
Tonight through Tuesday New Hampshire is not the 8220Live Free Or Die8221 state  Tonight through Tuesday New Hampshire is the 8220do or die8221 state for GOP presidential candidates  
We8217ll be in our little pink boat tonight on the scarlet seas making snide comments and doing what we can with a play by play unofficial transcript  
We8217ll recover tomorrow from tonight8217s bloodbath  Tomorrow we8217ll forgo the tedious football Superbowl  We8217ll watch the high tension drama of the Puppy Bowl instead

The Way Ted Cruz Won in Iowa Suggests Trouble Ahead
Ted Cruz kept his hopes alive with a comefrombehind victory in the Iowa caucuses this week But the way he won raises serious questions about his chances later on
He won Iowa for one reason He excelled among people who described themselves as very conservative They voted for him by a big margin he won 44 percent of them to Donald Trumps 21 percent according to exit polls He lost every other ideological category and often by a lot
The national Republican primary electorate is far more moderate than Iowas so Mr Cruz will need to attract a far broader coalition The history of recent conservative Iowa winners  like Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee  offers plenty of reasons to wonder whether he can count on doing so
In entrance and exit polls from 2008 and 2012 there was no primary state where the GOP electorate was as conservative as it was in Iowa Only Nevada had a similar ideological composition snip
As it is very conservative voters outnumbered the combined total of selfdescribed moderate and liberal voters by a 32point margin in Iowa in 2012  but by no more than 15 points in any primary state Louisiana Even in primary states with welljustified conservative reputations like Texas or Alabama very conservative voters outnumbered the total of selfdescribed moderates and liberals only by a fourpoint margin In the north moderate and liberal usually outnumber very conservative voters and often by a wide margin
Thats why Mr Cruz has so little traction in New Hampshire He would be expected to win only about 15 to 17 percent of the vote given the ideological composition of the New Hampshire electorate supposing he fared about as well among each demographic group as in Iowa Current polls show Mr Cruz earning nearly this exact amount
The Cruz campaign of course knows it has to broaden his appeal and it has tried to add evangelical voters to his base of conservatives
At first glance the Iowa results seem to suggest Mr Cruz could count on support from evangelicals the rest of the way He won 33 percent of them according to the exit polls which could position him to fare well in the South where evangelicals represent an even larger share of the primary electorate than they do in Iowa
But Mr Cruz mainly did well among evangelicals because theyre generally more conservative than nonevangelicals not because he held an especially strong appeal among them Thats very different from a candidate like Mr Huckabee in 2008 who did well among evangelicals regardless of their political ideology
Mr Cruz lost the somewhat conservative evangelical vote to Marco Rubio and fared poorly among moderate evangelicals  even if he did fare better than he did among nonevangelicals
Mr Cruz could get away with this in Iowa where 49 percent of evangelical voters were very conservative and just 8 percent were moderate according to exit polls But it doesnt work as well in the primary states where evangelical voters are far more likely to identify as moderate according to past exit polls snip
South Carolina will be a crucial test for Mr Cruz As with Alabama the exit polls suggest that the state is far more moderate than Iowa despite an even larger number of evangelical voters If he is going to compete nationally with a coalition of evangelicals and very conservative voters it will involve a win in South Carolina
So far it doesnt seem as if Mr Cruz is breaking through The most recent NBCWSJMarist poll of South Carolina showed him with just 11 percent of the moderate vote That could change but until it does its hard to take his chances much more seriously than those of Mr Huckabee and Mr Santorum who carried Iowa with demographically narrow coalitions that fell short elsewhere
Compared with those candidates Mr Cruz has two big advantages vastly superior fundraising and a strong campaign operation Whether thats enough to broaden his coalition will probably decide his finish in the race

10YearOld Boy Brutally Raped By Iraqi Migrant at Pool in Vienna
Police investigators have ascertained that the 20 year old man entered Austria on the 13th September travelling into the country via the Balkans
On the December 2nd he brutally attacked the young boy pulling him into a changing cubicle pulling down his swimming trunks and assaulting him snip
Following the attack the Iraqi amused himself by diving repeatedly from the three metre board The young boy meanwhile went to a lifeguard in tears and told him what had happened snip
During his interrogation the man attempted to excuse himself saying that it had been a sexual emergency
He explained that he had to satisfy himself with the lad as he had not had sex in four months explaining I couldnt stand not having sex as I have excess sexual energy

Two Migrants Among Gang of Seven Who Raped Unconscious Girl Said 8216Women Must Obey Men8217
The boy who attends the Ostend Technical Institute was being investigated for possible radicalisation after he showed classmates pictures of himself on Facebook wearing military gear and holding a submachine gun De Morgen has reported
The Belgian police seized his mobile phone as part of the investigation whereupon they found footage of the boy and six others the oldest aged 25 dancing laughing and singing in Arabic around their victim who was lying passed out The men then pulled down her underwear pushed her legs apart and groped and raped her
Of the seven males arrested two are Belgians and five are Iraqi immigrants Two are understood to have only recently arrived in the country to claim asylum
The group has apparently shown no contrition one is said to have told investigators She has nothing to complain about Women must obey men

		They even screwed up the introductions due to loud applause  
Martha Raddatz and 8220if it bleeds it leads8221 David Muir 8220moderate8221  
Muir  Temperament  
Trump  I have great temperament  I get along with many people  For years in business I get along with many  I took a lot of heat because I was the one that brought up illegal immigration  I also was against the Iraq War  I will build up the military
Muir  Cruz you said it about Trump
Cruz  Voters are looking to our temperament  Obama won8217t acknowledge radical Islamic terrorism  Every individual on this stage will make a better president  The question is who is best prepared on this stage  
Muir  Trump8217s temperament  
Cruz  The voters will decide  Who has the judgment when to engage when not to engage  For instance in Iran when Khameni chants 8220Death to America8221  
Trump  Ted did not answer your question  That8217s what will happen with our enemies  Ted backed down  That8217s what will happen to our enemies with Trump  We8217ll win
Muir  Your campaign has called Cruz8217s campaign deceitful What should Cruz do
Carson  Today is 105th birthday of Reagan so I will not savage the reputation of Senator
Cruz  I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me and those who volunteered for me including one who died that I would quit who would do such a thing  This is an example of Washington ethics which is if it is legal do it  My ethics is you do what is right  
Cruz  The Carsons are my friends  I apologized to Ben and I do so again tonight  What happened was that it was reported that Ben was going to Florida on the night of the caucuses  My team sent out the report  I was busy so I did not know what happened  I called Carson to apologize  That is what CNN reported  It was a subsequent report I wish my campaign forwarded  
Carson  The timeline indicates that within 1 minute CNN sent out my second statement  
Muir  Rubio  Christie warns against another first term senator  Santorum could not list your accomplishments  What are your accomplishments
Rubio  Against eminent domain Protection against terrorism  Joe Biden has been around a long time but that does not recommend him  Obama knows what he is doing  
Christie  Senators think about speeches  Governors think about what problems have to be solved  Rubio you have not been responsible for a decision where you had to be accountable  We should not make the same mistake as 8 years ago  I like Marco Rubio but he does not have the experience to be president  Do not make the same mistake again  
Rubio  Not just what you did but how it worked out  Under Christie the credit rating went down in New Jersey  Again Obama knows what he is doing and it is a disaster  
Christie  Think about this  That was a drive by shot by a Washington insider  That answer was prepared by an adviser  The people expect results such as plowing the roads  I rebuilt New Jersey  You are prepared to be president  
Rubio You had to be shamed to go back to Jersey when the snowstorm hit
Christie  There you go again the drive by hit prepared and memorized  
Rubio  You had to be shamed back  
Christie  The shame is you blame me for taking responsibility  
Rubio  You had to shamed8230
Christie  talking points8230 memorized
Muir  You endorsed Rubio for Senate but now you say he is ready  
Bush  Who has the leadership skills to lead  I have many endorsements from military leaders  You learn leadership by leading  Rubio is a skilled politician but not yet ready  
Raddatz  First term senator too  North Korea just conducted another missile  How would you respond as POTUS  
Cruz  The failure of the first Clinton administration  We should expand our missile defense capacity  Do not allow a North Korean satellite  Harden the electric grid
Raddatz  Would you have ordered a strike tonight  
Cruz  Hypothetical  
Raddatz  You talk tough on other issues
Cruz  I have not received a briefing yet like I have on other issues  
Rubio  He8217s right  It is standard procedure to shoot down missiles in mid flight if there danger  
Kasich  We have to intercept ships and aircraft  They want to proliferate these materials  I worry about nonstate actors  If China does nothing we should give missiles to allies in the region such as South Korea  
Bush  This is the Obama 8220strategic patience8221  The next president should do a preemptive strike if necessary  
Trump  Marco said Obama knows exactly what he is doing  I disagree  Obama has no clue  China has tremendous control over North Korea  China sucks trillions from our country  China should act strategically if necessary  
Rubio  Obama has betrayed Israel  Same in Asia  Donald is right China has a lot of influence over North Korea  
Raddatz  Student held hostage in NK
Bush  Obama weakness causes this  Crippling sanctions should be implemented against NK  
Christie  You never pay ransom I learned as prosecutor  When you do that you endanger others  We need a strong president  This is unacceptable  Hillary as an Obama third term would be weaker

		Muir  Illegal immigration  Deportation  
Kasich  Can8217t deport  Build a wall  Have them pay a penalty and let them stay  
Muir  How would you deport and solve illegal immigration
Cruz  Build a wall increase fourfold aircraft everify system biometric system on visas end welfare benefits and stop sanctuary cities  Enforce the law  The law states that those here illegally must be deported  Bill Clinton deported 11 million  Secure the border  
Muir  Gang of eight bill  You turned tail and ran as Bush says
Rubio  We can8217t pass that bill  We need to secure the border  Actually secure the border  Until then it is not possible  When I am president I will enforce the law then see what can be done  
Christie  The question was 8220did he fight for his legislation8221 but Rubio did not answer  In New Jersey I fought for what was right  That8217s leadership  
Rubio  It is not leadership if it does not pass  
Mary Katherine Ham  Repeal ObamaCare  Are you like Bernie Sanders
Trump  Common sense is what I am for  Insurance companies laugh  We8217ll increase competition  Health care savings plan  We8217ll take care of people in  the street and not let them die
Ham  Repeal ObamaCare in best interests  How do you convince the public
Cruz  Socialized medicine does not work  Repeal ObamaCare  Personal portable  
Ham  How and why to replace ObamaCare
Carson  Health empowerment accounts  No middleman  Lower catastrophic costs  I have a plan  
Muir  Eminent domain  
Josh McElveen You support eminent domain
Trump  Eminent domain is necessary for bridges and schools  Keystone Pipeline needs eminent domain  No roads no highways  A necessity  
Bush  For public purpose  But Trump took property away from an old woman  
Trump  Not true He wants to be a tough guy  I8217m being booed by the donors and special interests  I am self funding so they can boo all they want  The Keystone Pipeline is a private project

		Muir  What is a conservative
Kasich  Some rise but everybody has a chance
Muir  Conservative
Trump  Comes from conserve 8211 our money our country save our country  
Rubio  About 3 things  Limited government especially at federal level Free enterprise anyone can rise without pulling anyone down  National defense  
Muir  Economy  Christie says to ask you how  How many jobs would you create
Trump  Bring jobs back from China  Stop TPP which will be a disaster  We are the highest taxed country in the world  Cut taxes  Don8217t lose more companies  
Muir  Governorship metrics  Critique by Kasich  
Christie  His criticism uses old statistics  He8217s done a good job  Rubio says Obama knows what he is doing  Do vets think Obama knows what he is doing  Rubio acted as if his immigration bill wasn8217t his 
Kasich  In Ohio we went from deficit to surplus 
Rubio  Obama knows what he is doing  
Muir  Taxes
Rubio  Noone says we don8217t pay enough in taxes  Lower taxes on people and companies  
Bush  We need to create more millionaires  I have a plan  
Christie  In my state we raised taxes on millionaires  We lost millions of dollars  
Raddatz  Carpet bombing
Cruz  Overwhelming air power  Target oil facilities bridges  
Raddatz  Civilians hit
Cruz  We are sending in our troops with arms tied behind their backs  It8217s immoral  
Raddatz  Overwhelming force  
Rubio  They believe in a religious war  We need allies from the region  They have spread  A coalition

		Trump was saying that people couldn8217t get tickets to the debate because they were only offered to lobbyists special interests etc  He said 8220they8221 didn8217t want his people there  Using 8220they8221 made it sound like the special interests but it8217s probably the RNC I think he8217s careful about alienating them TOO much so doesn8217t always them out
He got booed  A good investigative reporter wbboei 8211 talk to your 8220friend8221 Sharryl this should interest her needs to check into this and publicize if true  Good for voters to know good for the whole country to know

		Trump  I warned years ago about bombing ISIS oil  I also warned about their banking system  What I said should have been done years ago  Don8217t just bomb the oil take it  
Raddatz  Libya  Chaos  Air strikes  Ground troops
Bush  Yes  This is Obama 8220leading from behind8221  70 plus attacks outside middle east by ISIS  Obama sees this incrementally  We have to lead  
Carson  I8217m not here just to be pretty  We need to be proactive  Libya is strategically located so that is where ISIS will go  Libya also has oil  We need to stop ISIS from taking over Libya  Listen to our military  
Muir  No torture  Waterboarding torture  Trump says not  
Cruz  It does not meet the legal definition  I joined with McCain to prevent it from happening  But if necessary I would use enhanced techniques  
Trump  People chopping the heads off Christians and others  Medieval times  Bring back waterboarding and a whole hell of a lot worse  
Bush  Not I  Get fully engaged and human intelligence  
Rubio  This is not law enforcement  This is antiterrorism  We should not be specific  We8217re not interrogating anyone now  Obama empties Guantanamo  
Ham  Executive orders  
Cruz  Obama abuses his executive power  Everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power and I will do that  
Ham  Deal maker
Trump  A good deal maker will make great deals  Ronald Reagan made deals with Tip O8217Neill  The Iran deal is the worse  Part of being a deal maker is grab em hug em kiss em but get the deals done  You can8217t go to Hawaii for 3 weeks  
Kasich  You have to plead with people  Obama is not a king  Executive orders should be issued after you consult  Americans first party second  
Bush  I agree with those who want to repeal unconstitutional acts  Bring back the Tenth Amendment  
Kasich  You have to have an agenda from the first day  Regulations taxes fiscal plan border protection fix social security  
Muir  Heroin
McElveen  Cruz you did not attend hearing on heroin  Are you sincere  
Cruz  My halfsister was addicted to drugs and alcohol  She was angry and not willing to listen  I paid for my nephew8217s education  Six years ago she died from an overdose  We also have to secure the border  We need the political will  
McElveen  Cross border enforcement  
Christie  I fight against this in New Jersey and I was a federal prosecutor  We8217ve closed the prison and turned it into a clinic  I8217m prolife for every life  
Raddatz via Larry O8217Connor  First women candidate  
Trump  I do well against Hillary  I am the last person Hillary wants to run against  12000 in South Carolina last night I8217ve built a movement  On heroin I said build a wall that works  I8217m not sure Hillary can run  Emails  Democrats will protect her  We can8217t have four more years of essentially Barack Obama  
Rubio  Our rallies show increased attendance  We will bring the party together  Hillary is unqualified  She lied to families of Benghazi  
Carson  Easy to contrast myself and Hillary Clinton  Deceitful on Benghazi  We did not send help to our own people  I would make it a referendum on deceit

		I don8217t know much about Carson8217s 8220health empowerment accounts8221 but based on what he said tonight I see problems He said it should be a family plan and benefits could be moved among the different family members I gather this would happen if one needs more benefits than another  What if two family members have catastrophic needs and the family disagrees how to move the  benefits around  What if their medical needs surpass the dollar amount delegated to that family unit
But what is a 8220family8221  Does he know that over half of marriages fail  What if the husband leaves the wife and children and relations are acrimonious How is the husband covered  What if the father never marries the mom in the first place  What if someone is single  Do they stay with their family of origin8217s 8220family plan8221  Even if they8217re 45 and forever single

		Muir  Divide between blacks and police  
Trump  Police are the most misunderstood  When police make a mistake the media focus for days on it  Minorities respect the police  The police can8217t act  We must give them respect  Our fantastic police  People sue all the time  Either you have a police force that does its job or none  I met with the police  
Kasich  People have to respect the police  Community leaders think the system works against them  I started a task force to bring the police and community together to winwin  
Muir  Obama visited Mosque so did Bush
Rubio  Obama says there is widespread discrimination against Muslims and there isn8217t  We face a significant threat from extremists  Christian groups like Little Sisters of the Poor are discriminated against not Muslims  
Raddatz  Zika virus  Ebola  You ordered a nurse quarantined  Would you do it again
Christie  The nurse had active symptoms and she was treating patients  We quarantined her for 48 hours  As to Mosques I built bridges but we cannot mix the radicals with the decent  
Carson  If we have evidence of infection and that it can spread we quarantine  But not willy nilly because of where they visited  We need rapid response systems  NIH CDC needs support  
Raddatz  Women register for Selective Service  
Rubio  Yes in case draft is instituted  What is important is our shrinking military  Rebuild  
Bush  I do  No political agenda on military  Eliminate the sequester  I have the support of Generals and Admirals  
Christie  I am a father of 2 daughters  Their sense of value comes from within  They are part of a greater effort  They should not be discriminated against such as registering for Selective Service  
Carson  14 decrease in military applications  Veterans committing suicide  Integrate veterans into society  Take care of our veterans so we don8217t have to institute a draft  
McElveen  Veterans  Privatize VA  
Bush  Give veterans choices  Career civil service reform would allow firings to fix VA system  
Kasich  Veterans should go anywhere they want to get help  College credit for service  Help veterans with job placement  
Rubio  My brother is a Green Beret veteran  He8217s had to fight for dental services  Veterans should be able to go anywhere to get services  
Muir  Families be allowed to raise ransom money
Cruz  It8217s difficult for families but this would put a bounty on other Americans  We don8217t pay ransoms as Obama has done with Bergdahl  
Trump  I know Diane Foley  I spoke for them and raised money for their foundation  But you cannot negotiate with terrorists or you will have more James Foleys  BTW I raised six million for veterans  Also there is tremendous fraud and waste in VA  
Ham  Young are for gay marriage but against abortion  
Rubio  Against gay marriage is not bigotry  I believe in marriage for one man one woman  On abortion there is a conflict on rights  I choose to err on the side of life  The media has not asked the Democrats one question at any debate on abortion  Democrats are the extremists on abortion  
Bush  I am prolife  Parental notification  Crisis pregnancy centers  I do believe there should be exceptions  I am in the sweet spot for a nominee  
Rubio  I am not for exceptions because I am prolife  But for me this is not a political issue  
Christie  I8217m from a prochoice state and I am prolife  Hillary wants to fund Planned Parenthood which kills in the womb for profit  I believe if a woman has been raped or incest she has a right to terminate the pregnancy

		Closing statements
Kasich  I8217ve done over 100 town halls  You8217ve changed me  I8217ve seen your hope and tears  My positive message  NH please give me a chance to go forward  
Christie  For 13 years I have served the people of my state and country first  I fought the war on terrorism  Rebuilt after Sandy  NH you8217ve gotten to know me  Give me your vote  
Bush  I want to thank the people of NH  I want to thank Reagan on his birthday  Make America safer greater freer  
Carson  The media has tried to ignore me  I8217m still here  I8217m not going anywhere  There is a place for integrity  I place the people at the pinnacle  
Rubio  This week my kids joined me  It reminded me of what is at stake  What kind of country will this be when they come of age  We will defeat Hillary Clinton  Leave this the greatest country  
Cruz  I campaigned against ethanol in Iowa  I stood up  The people of Iowa stood up against cronyism and welfare  I was stand with the American people  
Trump  That8217s because he got Ben Carson8217s votes  We don8217t win anymore  We don8217t win with healthcare or trade  If I8217m elected president we will win win and win

		Trump might be the super biggest winner  Best case scenario for Trump on Tuesday is a ten point plus victory over the second place holder  
Then the second place holder is neither Cruz nor Rubio
Then the third place holder is neither Cruz nor Rubio  
Bush comes in second or third  
Christie comes in second or third  
Why do we think this is the best scenario for Trump  Because then Trump wins NH and goes to South Carolina and a victory there  A victory in SC because of momentum from NH win  Also if Bush stays in he divides the vote with Rubio and neither gets traction against Trump  Same if Christie stays in  
The possibility this best case scenario develops for Trump is likely if not very likely  But of course dumb ass voters do what they want

		Rubio lost in a very big way but even bigger than most realize  
Why  Because tonight Chris Christie provided the template for attacks on Rubio  
Christie took Rubio8217s glib memorized statements and called them glib and memorized statements  The result was that Rubio looked stunned  Deer in the headlights  Rubio started to repeat himself as he was attacked for repeating himself  
Tonight Christie not only smashed Rubio  Christie also provided the answer to how to always smash Rubio

This perp is toast There is no problem with identification There was no provocation The intent to do grievous bodily harm is obvious
You should expect the ACLU to rush to his defense and tell the jury
Dear kindly jury member you gotta understand
It8217s just their bringin8217 upke that gets them out of hand
Their mothers all are junkies their fathers all are drunks
Golly Moses naturally they8217re punks
Oh dearest juror you should be upset
They never had the love that every child oughta get
They ain8217t no delinquents they8217re misunderstood
Deep down inside them there is good
There is good
There is good there is good
There is untapped good
Like Charlie Manson the worst of them is good
As a juror I would listen studiously to this defense just as I promised to do on voir dire
And then I would give the punk a cool 20 years at supermax
But to avoid the appearance of harshness I would cut five years off the sentence if he gave his ACLU defense lawyer a taste of the same medicine as he gave the victim so the ACLU could understand what it is they are defending

Well Shadow its very simple really
You thought the purpose of these debates was to elicit relevant information from the candidates about how they would approach the major issues of the day and govern the country so that you could make an informed decision on who to vote for
The purpose of these debates is to make money to advance the celebrity status of big media to make money to manipulate perceptions to make money to prop up the establishment candidate to make monye to destroy the insurgent and to make money And there is one other purpose    must be early Altzerhimers I can8217t remember     oh that8217s right the other purpose of these debates is to make money8211and to promote the celebrity status of big media
Perhaps that is why you learned nothing new from this debate You are not the problem Your perceptive skills are just fine When there is by design nothing to learn it stands to reason we would learn nothing

Her job was not as she saw it  It may have been sanctioned by her news station but that is still not the job  It seems that debates need to be taken away from the parties  And really 8211 it8217s just common sense  Does EVERYthing have to be 8220political8221 in politics  Good grief

Debates are basically the same and don8217t forget they are led by the moderators  Any new stuff is just going to be current events being used to generate 8220gotcha8221 questions for their nonpreferred candidates
I think most people are just starting to pay attention now 8211 some won8217t until the primary is soon to hit their state
Perhaps now that more people are paying attention and the field is winnowing down the remaining candidates may be able to make their points more as a whole etc
But there still remains the problem of biased corporate owned media people leading the debates8230  
Perhaps moderators should be experts in certain fields and each debate have a theme 8211 but have opposing moderators maybe because there are opposite points of views in many fields  For example if it were a global warming debate you couldn8217t just have a global warming scientist  You8217d have to have one that will cite all the research on the other side including the yearslong data fudging by the data collection center
Well whatever but I can see no constructive purpose to having tv personalities moderating debates8230

		VH 8211 and IIRC that last time Rubio was most definitely trying to change the subject he didn8217t want to answer about the Gang of 8 and IIRC Christie and the moderator on two different occasions reminded him that he didn8217t answer the question asked  So I think  he has some stock speeches to specific topics but he can also use them to try to change the subject8230

		You realize how rigged a game this is when you watch the various networks post debate coverage I find it amusing when MSNBC has 8220good republicans8221 on  like  Lindsey Graham  with 8220tingles8221 to prop up Bush and tear down Trump I think the system has been corrupt forever and it is just easier to see now in the 247 social media world we live in

		About time Trump informed the public that the audiences at the debates are stacked with establishment louts  

httpwwwbusinessinsidercomdonaldtrumpjebbushdebatecrowdboo20162
    The audience loudly booed Trump driving the backandforth off the rails Trump said audience members were all members of the Republican establishment
    Thats all of his donors and special interests out there Trump said of the people booing him Thats what it is And by the way let me just tell you We needed tickets You cant get them You know who has the tickets  Donors special interests the people that are putting up the money Thats who it is
    The booing continued Trump said he was selffunding his campaign so Republican donors werent a fan of his candidacy

		VH 8211 one point  If you want the 8220republican side8221 I don8217t believe this is the place lol  Try a republican site  
This is a site with people who loved Hillary but don8217t want Obama III  Most people here love Trump are not republicans and if they8217re like me won8217t be voting for a different republican if Trump is knocked out  Not that I wouldn8217t EVER vote for a republican 8211 I was a PUMA so of course I have voted republican twice  But I don8217t vote for candidates who are not NBCs and I don8217t think any of the others would be great like Trump  If Trump loses I8217ll probably just stay home
I8217m just one voice but I strongly disagree with the characterization of this site as having the 8220republican side8221  I don8217t know what this site will be tomorrow or the next day or how admin characterizes the evolution of this website but right now it basically is former Hillary supporters who are now supporting Trump  Nothing republican about that  Personally I don8217t even think TRUMP is a republican I think he is more like me looks at issues to hll with parties 8211 but running for president you have to join one of the  8220gangs8221 just like in prison lol

		gonzo 8211 Obama let the economy go to hlland was more than happy to  destroy the middle class with more and more taxes to pay for the lives of the more and more people who couldn8217t find jobs and others who would prefer to sit home and have their meager lives subsidized
The key IMO is the economy  A vibrant economy provides for jobs for people so they don8217t have to be subsidized  It also keeps us safer from foreign adversities
Hillary2008 knew that  She campaigned on that in 2008  
Now she8217s joined the 8220let8217s create an unAmerican nation of moochers and when the middle class disappears from all the subsidies wowsy we8217ll be in socialism land8221
Our young people and apparently the leftists don8217t even know what this country was founded on the entrepreneurial spirit the hard work the competition the always trying to do your best equal opportunity not the equal outcomes of socialism  Well everyone here knows the story  But I am shocked at the level of graduate school interns we get now 8211 they are not hard workers not engaged think they are entitled and don8217t know a quarter of what they think they know  They think they are a gift instead of a learner  Oh and people have problems because the government doesn8217t do enough for them
I strongly feel that if Trump doesn8217t win this will continue and goodbye to the amazing experiment of America  Killed from the inside

		I get what you8217re saying gonzo but that stream of people will never end  They really need to stay home and fight for their own countries fight the corrupt governments fight the drug lords  In other words destroy the problems make a stand  Finally  
These countries raise vicious drug lords and drug helpers 8211 don8217t any of the others residents have a fighting spirit  My point is that people always fleeing to western countries will bring down the ability to continue to be successful countries which fits in neatly with the globalists8217socialists8217 desire to have everyone equally miserable 8211 better to control them you know
Band together and get their hands on explosives if they can8217t get guns  Poison them  Set booby traps  Stab them in the back when you catch them alone  My point is there are ways to fight back

He could chase that three bagger Martha Raddatz all the way back to Idaho Falls
bag 1 married the son of Ben Bradlee former editor of WashPo8211deceased  Note this marriage helped launch her career with ABC news
bag 2 married the head of the FCC under Obama8211deceased  Note this glorious union helped her get in tight with Obama and his corrupt administration

		Trump is no smooth debater but he is the most effective communicator as Admin says in plain English about the realities of our situation  What made the whole debate worth watching was when Trump pointed out who was Booing him  Loved it 
Interesting dynamics with Rubio trying to distinguish himself as a leader by claiming BO8217s degeneration of the nation is intentional while the herd is following Trump with the incompetence story  I believe the truth to be both with a whole lot of corruption too
Rubio fell flat  And Christie was ON it  The herd is following Trump and I think this shows that he is winning the Party  The big question about the position is this  If BO is intentionally destroying the nation why haven8217t they done their job and impeached him  Yes it is better to just dismiss BO as a bum

I do not consider myself a Democrat or Republican  I consider myself an American  More relevant is the Nationalist versus Globalist characterization  The current Globalization has gone horribly wrong hijacked by corporate sociopaths and Nazi and every human being on the planet should fight it  I think that is what this election is about
We are set to be globalized like farm animals most of whom will be abused and slaughtered  Look at Europe  It is happening  It is a horror
A return to Nationalism in the USA can slow down the globalization process and allow for a realignment with the populous issues more fairly represented  The only one who has shown the willingness to lead this effort is Trump  That is why I do not care what he sounds like or what he looks like or even if he represents all my values 
Moderate Globalist Hillary would have worked in 2008  Both could have gotten a lot of what they wanted  That is why we supported Hillary  But they wanted to perpetrate their full horror so they pushed BO in instead  That was the mistake of 821708 That was why they were so determined that they let us see just how antidemocrtic they are  But they have started to boil the frogs to fast  They have made their bid for their full sociopatic agenda  Now they want to offer us Moderate Globalist Hillary  8220She can fix it8221 or 8220JEB can fix it8221 That is what they are offering

		Very interestingly China8217s economic crash is looking to be between July and December of this year just around election time  And you can bet Soros and other hedge fund managers are in the game  From zerohedge
Recently an important question that has emerged is for how much longer can China sustain its FX intervention before tapping out and letting the hedge funds win with their short Yuan bets once total reserves drop below the critical redline of approximately 27 trillion as calculated by the IMF 8211 the answer is between 5 months and 10 months assuming monthly reserve burn rates of 130BN to 60BN

		Cruz lied    
Cruz blamed CNN for a message his campaign sent to supporters the night of the Iowa caucuses suggesting Carson was going to suspend his campaign
8220My political team saw CNN8217s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers it was being covered on live television8221 Cruz said during the debate
Cruz also claimed CNN had inaccurately reported that Carson was suspending his campaign 8220from 630 pm to 9158221 and 8220didn8217t correct that story until 915 that night8221
That is false CNN never reported that Carson was suspending his campaign and never issued a correction because there was no need to do so

What makes that video funny is it proves how clueless and brain dead Martha is So is her male cohort of course but he is not the star of the show She is And there she stands like a loon not realizing that two of the insurgents have not come on the floor and then with a half empty stage she announces like a drill sergeant ladies and gentlemen there they are the republican candidates for president present and accounted for I cannot overlook the possibility that this was intentional since it is the earnest desire to get rid of Donald and Ben and they have tried every trick in the book to accomplish that to the point that they and their cohorts have destroyed any credibility they might otherwise have had  The fact that the American People might not want what big media wants never entered their mind Obama once said FOX was not a news network FOX has proven that statement to be true okay fine this time Obama did not lie but even a blind pig finds an acorn once in a while but that indictment extends to all of big media It defines what they are and what they are not

Now we have a new cnn poll that shows Trump gaining at 33 before the debate and oh dem ruby slippers rising above Cruz to second place
Last nights deer in the headlight Dan Quale like performance may curtail this breathless widely reported surge that big media8211especially fox have been promoting

		The investigative journalist has told me that the Clinton foundation paid off Marco8217s student loan much to the chargrin of Bush He was supposed to be a Bush asset and now he is not That old saying dance with the date that brung ya aint in Marco8217s repertoire Like the giggalo he is ruby slippers8211that Cuban Richie Cummingham with is prepared speeches is for sale to the highest bidder If true this would tend to confirm what Roger Stone is saying namely that Hillary is feted to win Jeb now Rubio is a 8220ringer8221 feted to lose A fine little minuette where they all have a role to play big media donors the parties donors and of course the actors Only one problemo donald trump He is the bull in the china shop or should I say in their little shop of horrors

VH  saw you at Upps place the other night

just want to mention that when I used to check out Uppity in the past I noticed there is a poster called 8216S8217 there8230just want to clarify that is not me8230frankly I only have time to post here and feel like this is home8230I probably should have started with a better name than simply 8216S8217 but so be it now8230

		That was a very good fuck you to big media that donald did When the music starts it is up to the elephants to join trunks to tails and march out on stage in a circle so the big media overseers can do their carnival barking routine That gesture by Donald to hold back with Ben and relieve him of any potential embarrassment was a stroke of genius BECAUSE IT PROVED just how scripted and oblivious to the facts big media itself is Jb will remember one of the things Judge Stern always cautioned young attorneys on cross examination8212do not become so wedded to your script that you fail to listen to the witnesses answers and pay attention to what is happening in the court room Good advice for Martha too

		Yes I know It sounds like I am picking on Martha
Why you ask do I not devote equal time to her male counterparts
Simple they are nobodies not worth commenting on
But why Martha you ask
Is it perhaps her gender
Well yes and no
What do you mean by yes
What I mean is Martha Dana Meeeagin and my light of love Andrea have promised each other that they will get Hillary elected
If they want to support Hillary that is fine It may even be commendable depending upon your point of view
But for them to openly declare that they will use and if necessary abuse their positions of power to effect such a result is wrong
On the other hand this is what these so called journalists do
And in fairness none of us could cover politics like they do in that town in those companies without harboring some thought that you know more than the voter
And when you have a personal agenda whether that be to help a friend or break the glass ceiling the temptation to abuse your role becomes irresistible
I said yes and no above8211when asked if my comments were directed at her gender That is the yes part of it Here is the no part of it
In the 1992 election Bill Clinton found himself on the ropes over the Gennifer Flowers affair His campaign came to the head of 60 Minutes and the executive editor did what he described as a puff piece on Clinton8211the way he put it was clinton was very sick and needed strong medicine so they gave it to him Later Tim Russert came to that executive editor and told him 8220you got Clinton elected8221
That I submit is the game they are playing

		Voting Hillary8230I have to agree with lorac and others8230this is definitely not a republican site8230no way8230
Admin has always provided a space that tells it like it is8230like it or not8230that is what I respect the most8230no pandering no denial no delusion and no excuses8230just straightforward8230and let the chips fall where they may8230
that is what makes this the best site out there8230people who want to honestly discuss the current political events can come here and not be afraid to express themselves or feel they have to withhold discussing issues that are bothering them or they do not understand or frankly they believe are unacceptable8230
it is not created to be a blind cheerleading place8230very often in the past years we have nailed others for being hypocrites8230no one can accuse this site of being hypocritical8230
there are other sites where you can find people that agree with you all the time but this place is alive dynamic and unpredictable8230oh and often very funny8230and there is strength in our differences of opinion8230
some people do not like it8230and resent other people expressing independent thoughts or opinions or just want to hear what they agree with with no criticism of Hillary8230but again8230being free and open to discuss all sides is what makes this place a cut above so many other places8230we are fearless8230
and for the record8230I became an independent after the 2008 primaries debacle8230no way do I consider myself a republican8230or sadly a democrat anymore8230I grew up8230and I agree with Lorac I honestly believe that Donald Trump is his own man and not afraid to be independent8230that is one of the strongest attractions I have to him8230
imho8230he is one of the tough 8216good guys82178230and we need someone who is tough and on our side now8230
8230as always I respect the opinions of those who are different than mine8230I just don8217t like the cheap shots that have nothing to do with the issues or policies each candidate is pitching and selling8230if the issue is illegal immigration then let8217s discuss which candidate will do what etc8230

I absolutely agree with both of you  I was a democrat my entire life until 2008 and then became independent  I registered R for the first time in my life recently only so that I could vote for Trump in the primary  In NY you must be registered in one of the political parties to vote in their primary and that can only be way in advance  There is no Independent primary in NY  An independent is anundeclared voter
I am NOT a Republican I believe in universal NOT for PROFIT healthcare women8217s rights gay rights human rights and civil rights and our constitution  Unfortunately the current dem party has made a mess of the economy healthcare immigration and our foreign policy
Both parties are entirely corrupt and the system is corrupted  I pray for a Trump victory for good management common sense and a start at cleaning house in DC

		A republican site
You have got to be shitting me
Like no other8212
This site tells the truth8212the what the how and the why
This site promotes country over party8211either party
This site offers a clear view of strategy8211what works and what does not
And it has done so at the expense of friendships with former associates in the democrat party
At the same time its past association with Hillary makes it unacceptable to Republicans
Milton truth comes like a bastard into the world bringing ill fame to him who wrought it
Better that than to sit back and watch events proceed with dramatic precision to a disastrous result which no one talked about but everyone agrees after the fact was inevitable
We are seeing a variation of that now with NYT Unwilling to acknowledge their prior role in promoting Obama and his cloud cuckoo land policies they are now reporting the truth about the collapse of our foreign policy Its not the post mortem that counts its what is said and done in the moment
Suffice it to say Admin aint playing that game 
Here we get the truth with the bark off
Like the rest of us Admin has pointed the way for Hillary and she has not taken it
That leaves us with a choice identity politics or the values we believe in
Rubio is the classic case of identity politics
He has a speech he loves America but his values are for sale
Leadership should be made of sterner stuff

All relationships have their ambiguous side
You think you know someone and you set your expectations accordingly
Then they do something that is inconsistent with what you expected
You notice it and figure it was maybe just a bad day or the result of our moody selves
Then it happens again and you start making excuses8211what am I missing am I the problem etc
That is generally a good time to open a dialogue but most people do not
Then it happens a third time
Now you must decide whether to keep the faith or believe your lying eyes
That is the process I have gone through here relative to Hillary

		Well Roger Simon is in a wealthy town in New Hampshire with a sold out audience for Oh dem Ruby Slippers pondering how badly ruby slippers slipped last night in the debate and tomorrow in the polls After everyone meaning of course Roger and maybe his Portuguese water dog was expecting Rubio would pull another upset and take New Hampshire without all that boyish charm which came up short last night
Hey Roger wake the fuck up You cannot take the read of New Hampshire from the reaction of a wealthy audience They judge a candidate on his looks alone and his persona They feel safe in ignoring the real question ie can he govern Because whether he succeeds or fails they will always have Paris
The good thing is he said Trump won by default Of course he then goes on with a little snark saying that Trump strut across the spin room like a matador who had just been awarded the bull8217s ears Now Christie is a bull in a china shop and if you don8217t believe me ask Ruby Slippers But the last time I looked Christies ears were still intact Thus the explanation for Rogers metaphor must lie elsewhere
The really offensive part of his comments however were yet to come For he went on to say if Trump wins we will have the most gorgeous first lady since Cleopatra He forgets we have already had the most gorgeous first lady since Cleopatra8211or maybe he means Michelle is Cleopatra If so then I am quite sure that Michelle would agree But I think she more closely resembles Marie Antoinette Maybe it is that Austrian accent

I do not believe I was mistaken about who Hillary is  I never though she was the perfect candidate in 2008 In fact I only expected that she would reflect 60 of my values and deliver on around 50 and I would only get about 30 of what I wanted  
It was the outrage of the antidemocratic party in the 2008 primary that inflamed me to get involved and raise my voice  But it was about the adulteration of the process as much as it was about Hillary  
At a personal level I like Hillary  But she is not representing herself as the person the country needs right now  I am glad to have Trump as a better alternative

Did you make a mess at Upps place again ROFL

So much appreciated VH  I have visited Upps a few times and Still4Hill  It8217s good to check in with old friends 8211 get their take on things   This has been a weird primary season 8211 to say the least  
I wonder what will happen here if someone other than Trump wins the Repub nomination  If Trump runs as an indy things will stay as they are more or less  If he doesn8217t run period I wonder who the majority of Pinkers will support

		Lu I get the concerns people have voiced about Hillary with regard to some issues  8211 because of her stated approval of BO8217s presidency and her own policy statements   8211 influenced to some degree  I believe by the fact that she is totally convinced rightly or wrongly and I believe wrongly that if she doesn8217t give Barack the props he and the Dims want him to get she has no chance at nomination HOWEVER 8211  I don8217t think there is one reason to question Hillary8217s support of women  
Sometimes  to figure out what people will do and what they value you need to look their past actions  That often is more telling than campaign statements and party politics and  maneuvering

It8217s not like I went from Hillary 100 to Hillary 0  It was a long long process  Wondering if she was being bribed or blackmailed wondering if she had brain damage wondering if she was trying to trick someone to snake her way through8230 to wondering was it 2008 or 2016 that was the real Hillary8230  to wondering if Hillary is just a politician like the others nothing more  To finally that she very clearly doesn8217t believe what I believe in that8217s the bottom line
I agree with what S was saying it wasis sooo nice to have a  place to do my wondering to talk with others wondering what the heck happened to Hillary trying to figure it out being free to as wbboei put it above to choose our  values over identity politics to remain country over party still PUMAs

Check out this post she seems to be moving from Hillary more towards Sanders but this is a former PUMA blog  But she doesn8217t seem to feel that Hillary is addressing women8217s needs especially middle age and older choosing instead to focus on Obama8217s younger people of both genders the post is not solely about Hillary

		lorac from  her work for Children8217s Defense Fund in the beginning of her career to her support of microloans to her support and campaign efforts on behalf of women candidates to her treatment of female employees  during her term as FLOTUS day care on premises I believe Hillary has demonstrated her support of women and children unquestionably The article below  addresses Hillary8217s commitment to women
_____
Why I Support Hillary by Sherrye Henry
She Supports Womens Businesses
I first met Hillary Clinton when she was First Lady and I was appointed by the President in 1995 to run the Womens Office at the US Small Business Administration
By reputation I knew that Hillary cared deeply about moving women forward in the economy  I was unprepared however for how passionate she was about it
Case in point After visiting Pakistan in 1994 and seeing  Muhammad Yunuss Grameen Bank in action she returned with the obvious question  Why doesnt the US have a microlending program
At her urging SBA wrote the necessary legislation which the Congress then passed  Who were the chief beneficiaries of those microloans  Women of course who were and still are finding it very difficult to get bank loans to start their businesses
In speaking events around the country I never failed to use one  of Hillarys favorite remarks More womens dreams die in bank
She didnt stop there When the President signed the Welfare Reform Bill in 1996 our agency got a clear directive from the White House  It was to get welfare recipients  who were mostly women  into the national economy
We got to work  At the start of my term the SBA had 22 centers around the country where women could find free information about starting and growing their businesses developing marketing plans and applying for loans  At the end of the Clinton Administration we had 100 centers  two in every state  And Hillary  always the wind at our back  was on hand at the opening of many of those centers to get them off to a fast start
You learn a lot about a person when you know what they care about and then see whether theyre willing to put their ideas into actions  I saw first hand Hillarys nonstop determination to help American small businesswomen  And then marveled when as Secretary of State in almost every stop in every country she included a meeting with small businesswomen
It was no surprise to me that she was quoted last week on a campaign stop in South Carolina stating I want to be the small business president
This dogged determination to promote the cause of small businesswomen is the reason that Ive helped found Executive Women  for Hillary  Together lets build this coalition  It will help make the first woman president of the United States also the first president ever for small business

		Christie also had the most devasating attack of the night
Christie urged Republicans not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago in electing a firstterm senator Barack Obama Bush eagerly piled on Weve tried it the old way Bush said echoing Christies warning of a repeat Obama act
When Rubio listed some of his Senate accomplishments Christie hammered him on that too in particular Rubios backing of a bill cracking down on Hezbollah and his spotty attendance record for Senate votes Thats not leadership Christie said Thats truancy
Rubio tried to hit back at Christie over attendance only to have it boomerang The Florida senator pointed that Christie only reluctantly went back to New Jersey for 36 hours during a big snow storm 8220That had to shame you into going back Rubio said
Christie shot back  The shame is Marco you would actually criticizes someone for showing up to work8221
Hinting that Rubio is the GOP Obama resonates with a lot of Republicans who worry about the senator8217s inexperience and questionable positions on some key issues

Sorry to cut in but if you still don8217t know what Hillary has done for women children and men too8230you have a lot of homework 
If your only impression of Hillary is one speech and the 2008 election then you don8217t know much about Hillary
Here is one list  httpwwwaddictinginfoorg20150413heresalistofhillaryclintonsaccomplishmentssoquitsayingshedoesnthaveany

		Presenting live Donald Trump and the copy cats  
foxy you consistently have the best lines
And I agree with how you used the plural for 8220copy cats8221  I can8217t remember what was said in the first debate but I do know that Trump was the first to bring all these issues up and only after he was laughed at and then acknowledged did these weasels start saying the same things I8217ll bet a comparison of debates 1 and 6 7 would be so telling lol
It8217s frustrating 8211 on one hand Trump reminding people of certain things again and again such as 8220I said this first8221 can feel tiresome and on the bragging side 8211 but many people haven8217t paid attention before now and just don8217t KNOW what has gone before
I DO wish he had explained more about Cruz stealing votes from Carson and about the donors in the audience and why they don8217t like him not just 8220I don8217t want their money8221 but more towards 8220I can8217t be bought by them8221 8211 because there could have been a lot of people who may not have understood the references
although it didn8217t start on time so I was reading something and when I went back to look 1520 minutes later it had already started so perhaps I missed something related to this8230

And I said her 8220work8221 for women seems more heavily weighted towards words than action

		Lorac sometimes speaking out when no one else has had the guts to do so or has even seen a reason to speak out is tantamount to 8220action8221  
Words are the precursor to activism  Many leaders throughout history have made their marks by first informing themselves about issues developing a deeper understanding about them recognizing the need for change then writing and speaking about changes needed  
 I think Hillary can be credited with both words and with actions

		free and shadow 8211 why are you insisting on combining childrenfamilies with women  rhetorical question I know why   
Maybe the women8217s movement I was a part of in the 70s and 80s was really for children and men and I misunderstood lol
Yes I get that children are a women8217s issue but rightly are also a men8217s issue 8211 they are a parental issue  
There are more words than action about WOMEN and in this campaign not even all that many words about women might turn off her Obama friends8230
But we already know that we disagree about Hillary2016

That is what I responded to You can throw your insults around that I dont know who Hillary is8230
8212
You said you only knew Hillary since 2008 and a speech she gave Didn8217t you
What Hillary has accomplished has been going on for years she is in her mid sixties so I gave you a couple of links so you could see some of what she has done
You thought I was insulting you but I was trying to lead to understand why some of us are supporting Hillary If you had opened up the two links I provided for you you would have seen longs lists of how she has supported women over the years
If you don8217t want to know what Hillary has done that8217s entirely up to you
Funny that you would accuse me of acting emotionally without looking though what I was sending you
You have misrepresented me many times in the past and I have just pushed you away without saying much

		Shadow you win  He obviously has never employed women and certainly never in the highest positions in his firms  Because if he had it would have been on your definitive list
And I8217ll head you off on the next one 8211 he criticized and insulted some specific women  You8217re right he8217s sexist he has never crassly insulted any men
You will always like Hillary no matter what  You know darn well you liked Trump until he insulted Hillary  I still can8217t figure out how that hit you from left field in light of the fact you know about politics  
We have different opinions on Hillary  We8217ve known that for a long time  I8217m not interested in arguing about Hillary  I8217m focused on saving our country  and that8217s not snark

I NOTICED Hillary when she gave the 1995 speech  I was not into politics  Hillary in 2008 attracted me INTO politics  By your logic I learned nothing about Hillary 8211 perhaps I just voted for her because she is a woman  Yeah that8217s the ticket because I8217m an idiot who does not read about someone I8217m interested in

I don8217t know why I got sucked into this  You8217re going to have  to get your jollies and Hillary high by 8220fighting for Hillary8221 with someone else lol  I have zero interest in arguing about Hillary  She8217s your cup of tea and no longer mine based on who she herself says she is  That8217s not a problem for me

Builds lots of big buildings and golf courses
821282128212
Which can only mean he is fully capable of rebuilding the country
You probably do not remember the story I told you a few years ago about my friend the city psychiatrist of Miami who went off the deep end and hired an off duty cop to murder an attorney who was harassing an imaginary girlfriend He and I played Doral Golf Course before Miami bought is My green fee was 1600 The doc was a celebrity so they let him on free
In those days the facility was run down  Then Trump bought it and it is now world class The name has been changed to Trump National But it is the same lay out The championship is called the Blue Monster 
httpswwwtrumphotelcollectioncommiamimiamigolfratesphp
The green fees have gone up Slightly
httpswwwtrumphotelcollectioncommiamimiamigolfratespackagesphp
I played golf one time with a Mexican exec at the Dominion in San Antonio He did our distribution throughout Mexico He owned something 5000 acres or maybe it was 50 or maybe even 50000 now I cannot remember He traced title to Juan Soldier of Spain 1509 And of course he drove a Rolls Royce like everybody else does in Mexico He could afford the new green fees I cannot
This is why it makes eminent good sense to make Mexico pay for the wall and a golf course beside it Then they can pay for the cost of the wall through green fees rather than excise taxes In that case there would be no violation of NAFTA GATT or the other globalist ties that bind

		The other thing that Mexican aristocrat told me is that he was Spanish there were eight million of us meaning Spaniards and the rest are Indios  And then he told me that 10 million Mexicans live directly or indirectly off the mega garbage dump in Mexico city If that it true then they are as invisible to the elites as the 94 million Americans of working age who are not working are to ours as they bask in the false glow of a 5 unemployment rates
If La Raza was worth a shit they would be attacking the Mexican elites rather than the American Middle Class with their illegals are the backbone of this country nonsense But they are no different from the rest of the progressives they want soft targets to attack and use for propaganda purposes It is pure Alinsky which is why they must never be allowed to have a seat at the table except they have
Note I remember now He said he owned 500000 acres8212hell that is bigger than the King Ranch right Gonzo

I agree
What I said above is satire
It can be done and it must be done
But it does depend on how he gets Mexico to pay for it
This business about NAFTA GATT and WTO however is not fiction
When all we wanted was to ensure that meat was labelled to reflect its country of origin those stupid pieces of legislation stood in our way
This is why this TPP stuff is so critical Obama8217s stated goal is to pass this anti American worker treaty to ensure that no future president can get out of it and the working people of this nation are how shall I put it    permanently fucked
Of course Tednado favored that act because he believes in free trade and surely not because his donors wanted it He is the only one on the stage who has fought against the cartel etc8212unless they are allied with his donors

The facts are out there 8211 do your own research  
I agree with you that Dims in general and Hillary in particular need to speak out against Islam8217s treatment of women  But you8217re the one who said words didn8217t matter
For that matter I think Trump Cruz Rubio should speak out against the treatment of women by fundamentalist religions in this country  Likely to  happen  Not if they want the effing evangelical votes

About Obama wanting to tie future presidents8217 hands 8211 I thought there was some rule that prevented that that anything one president does can be undone  by another  So there must be something special and diabolical about the TPP that it can bind future presidents  I sure don8217t put it past him

8220You have to ask yourself when youre thinking about who you choose as a Commanderinchief how youd feel about somebody whos willing to give the Chamber of Commerce everything they want and willing to give La Raza everything they want  someone whos willing to give Larry Ellison everything he wants someone whos willing to give Microsoft everything they want and Mark Zuckerberg everything he wants but someone who is not even willing to have an honest meeting with ICE officers You have to ask yourself what game was he playing What was the goal What could compel somebody to do that
Because remember he had all the leverage He could have said to Chuck Schumer anytime he wanted to Mr Schumer unless Chris Crane gets what he wants Im walking away
Remember what Rubio always says when hes asked about his involvement in the Gang of Eight He says Well I just wanted to get the best bill I could get out of the Senate  But as this story proves that statement is materially false because at any point if he had said to Schumer Im walking away unless you give ICE what they want If he had done that Schumer would have had no choice but to make those changes So the fact that he didnt do that is proof that every time Rubio says I tried to get the best bill out of the Senate the unfinished part of that sentence is I tried to get donors and open borders interest groups the best bill for them that I could get out of the Senate And Chris Crane would have been an impediment to delivering for these donors and interest groups

		Most of Hillary8217s plans for women are crumbs from the table  It is my experience that we are denied our slice of the pie by the courts failure to enforce existing discrimination laws  That is why we make 80 of what a man does for the same work  
Judges have the right to declare summary judgements in civil cases since 2000  And they use it shamelessly even on cases where they hold special interests  The corporations rule  It does not matter how many laws you make the judge says you got no case you got no case  If you protest your lawyer get sanctioned  
So how is Hillary going to get us equal pay  I have never heard her plan

		free8230in answer to your question re if Trump does not get the nomination8230I don8217t know8230I am going to be honest and I know some here do not like hearing it but I cannot lie8230
I am having alot of trouble trusting Hillary8230to me she is not the same Hillary of 2008 and her priorities and obligations have changed8230in my heart of hearts she is to entangled with Soros and his money and the rest of her doners and O8230I am tired of that old game8230
I think her association with the O admin has really compromised her independence and the policies she will now be promoting
in addition again I am sorry but that obscene amount of money she has received from Wall St and the drug and insurance companies is a big turnoff to me8230I feel she is way too much of an insider now
I do not want O3 and she keeps telling me that is what she will deliver8230i want a complete break from that8230I am afraid for my country8230I am a boomer but what happens to the rest of the generations to come if Hillary continues with O8217s open borders santuary cities the whole entire mess that is going on now8230Ocare etc8230
so I do not know8230I will listen and keep an open mind and see how things play out but at the moment it gives me no pleasure to say that she has lost my trust8230and alot of what she is saying leaves me cold8230I think O robbed her of her time and that time may now be in the past8230she sounds so angry and defensive tone deaf and removed to me8230for example 8220that8217s what they offered82218230that really rubbed me the wrong way
again I am speaking for myself8230not to get into an agrument or back in forth with anyone8230it is draining enough that I am so very personally disappointed in her8230
so I do not know8230I might do what Shadow is doing and stay home8230one thing I know for sure I cannot support O3 and four more years of what he started8230

		Look Donald Trump has done some amazing things to change the dialog of the Republican Presidential Race  His positions of 2030 years are video documented He is a businessman and a builder and has a social conscious  It is very likely he would be a good president and do what he says he is going to do  We have someone we could vote for
Hillary has an outstanding record of public service that has been tainted by association with Obama  Her campaign is really bad  We are all wondering what is going on and will she change course  And if she changes course can you trust her  A lot of questions  I would like to see her as the Democratic Candidate  
I am supporting Trump as the Republican Candidate  I cannot support the campaign Hillary is running but I hope she gets the nomination  What I would really like to see is a ClintonTrump debate  
If Clinton and Trump are nominated it would be the first time in my lifetime where I actually liked both presidential candidates

82128211
Even though I am not an enthusiast of history in and of itself I do think the situation of women finally getting equal pay for the same job that men have will come down to changing society8217s belief on what is fair and the right thing to do
I have brought up the struggle with getting the right to vote for women back almost 100 years ago If the dialogue doesn8217t start at the top become important in our own families women coming together to support each other on this issue it probably will not happen
Like you said just changing the law isn8217t all it will take If women don8217t believe they deserve equal pay doing the SAME job8230men are certainly not going to make it happen if history proves anything
If Hillary became our President she would not stop talking and fighting for equal pay 
That8217s my guess it isn8217t a simple solution in my opinion8230it takes women banning together on this and men agreeing are more than welcome to join in

If you missed the Oscars last year she did a fabulous tribute to Julie Andrews by singing highlights from the Sound of Music And if you have not heard it do yourself a favor and give a listen to her duets albumcdwhatever she did with Tony Bennett Pure aural bliss

I remember so many of us talked about in 08 how the party left US and HILLARY behind with what went on in 08

We do have to remember that Hillary 08 could not beat the system  I am guessing this is what she considers her other option  It is going to be tough watching this  And the primary is another five months away  
Bernie is going to win NH and then Hillary will take SC  Not much drama
But I so do appreciate Trump whipping up on the establishment stooges  They really are  bunch of ugly penguins  I actually laugh about these politics and it feels real good after years of dread

		Richard asks the question that everyone in the country has been pondering for the past eight years and especially after Obama told Croft that he has been not only our greatest president but a seminal figure in world history on a par with Moses or more likely Mohammed 
Q Is the big media beloved messiah incompetent or is he nefarious 
In the debate last night Trump chose the latter Rubie slippers the former and I    I say why split the infinitive lets be inclusive and say both And lets add deranged in there someplace too
But here is Richard8217s measure of this touchable god
To be really dangerous a historical personage has to be enough of a winner to build up a following Hitler was the classic example His apparent successes in the early war years provided the capital to fatally overreach Similarly Japan8217s 6month opening winning streak was enough to sustain imperial legitimacy until late 1945  Without those abilities neither would have gone very far Of the three Axis Powers Mussolini had the least competence and he was never more than a clown
Because Obama consistently failed at most everything he rapidly lost the ability to make the disastrous big bet  In the twilight of his presidency the administration is more impotent than actively dangerous having squandered his political capital 8212 and his nation8217s prestige in the last seven years  This suggests irrespective of malice that a good dollop of incompetence was present  Incompetence is in many ways a selflimiting condition When Clint Eastwood on the final night of the 2012 Republican convention famously addressed an empty chair the symbolism captured not just the worry but also the limits of what an Obama presidency could do
Lawrence Peter author of the Principle by the same name wrote  sometimes I wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on or by imbeciles who really mean it
President Obama may have tried to appease the crony capitalists and allowed totalitarianism to spread throughout the world But along the way he may have fatally wounded the European Union wrecked the majority of Islamic countries and poisoned the public8217s view of Wall Street
To recap why are things the way they are however they are  Rubio thinks it8217s the smart people  Trump thinks it8217s the imbeciles

821282128212
But but but Richard lest we forget big media worked day and night to turn Obama shit into apple butter and promised us a new heaven and a new earth They gave him the political capital he needed by making failure look like success And they did this 247 Consequently he was able to break out of the narrow constraints of his own incompetence and wreak lasting havoc on the world The only time any of us were really safe was when he was on the golf course or on one of his 52 vacations

		wbboei I agree I think the media is the biggest barrier to our country8217s health  They are supposed to protect us from the government and in an election race should be vetting all the candidates and not tipping the scales  But that would require our media to become detached from the corporations I think I  read that there are  56 corporations that own all our media
That8217s why I8217ve said that it8217s great that Trump tells that candidates and politicians maybe parties themselves are bought by corporations special interests etc
But it would be great to also add in that the media is also owned and directed  He should also probably explain the role of the media to investigate and protect us by sharing what they find and why they get 1st Amendment protection to do that since I don8217t think schools teach that anymore

		Enough Dr Carson  You know I used to have some respect for Carson even though he has run bad campaign blames others and then there is this whining and whining Poor little him  I can no longer deal with people who play the victim card  Cruz has apologized for doing what Rubio and other campaigns did which was to take the weird info from CNN and pass it on Most of the people I8217ve talked with said that when they heard the news that Carson was going back to Florida and not going to NH they all thought he was dropping out especially since his poll numbers have been dropping like a rock Okay so his campaign is inept  Perhaps Dr Carson needs to look within to see his naive role in it all  He spouts the Bible but will not accept an apology  The Bible says forgive He forgave Trump apparently for saying he was pathological and much worse back earlier in the campaign  
No more whining and trying to resurrect your failing campaign Dr Carson  You are only losing face religiously  We are tired of it  Pull up your big boy pants throw out your victim card and move on

Well it depends on which theory you subscribe to
Under the Roger Stone theory the election has been rigged Hillary is the designee and Bush is the ringer And like any ringer in boxing he does not simply take the fall he expects to be paid for the stunt and the ignominy it produces The same would be true of ruby slippers is he is the nominee 
There is another theory that Soros is a sociopath he is older than Methusala and his sons do not want to run the business Therefore ownership has passed to a third party and Soros has retained a life estate in the business which ceases when he dies Rubio was originally a Bush asset and if he had remained one he never would have run against Jeb Therefore he has switched loyalties8211for money This is what the investigative reporter is looking into She comes from one of the greatest newspapers in history If the dots cannot be connected8211and independently verified the article is never published At this point it is merely a theory Where Soros is concerned the best information comes from Europe

		One other thought The more you study the process8212who runs who gets supported how the rules weed out good people how the process rewards institutional loyalty how delegates are awarded how big media is recruited to kill off those the establishment does not like and how the conventions are run the more you realize that what we have here is exactly what UCLA Professor Sheldon Wolin Chris Hedges and I suspect Glenn Greenwald are trying to tell us about our system is categorically true it is a system of managed democracy and inverted totalitarianism with the corporate globalists in control And if that is true then the idea that elections are rigged does not seem nearly so far fetched

The implosion of the EU perfectly meets those criteria I8217ve read that Brussels is the great washout zone of the the great families and fortunes of Europe The dummies and mental cases of old and puttered out DNA of clans of industrialists academics diplomats and aristocracy were sent to further their interests via the globalist agenda enforced by the faceless blob technocrats of the EU They could draw fabulous salaries without draining what remains of the family pot and keep them busy too The problem of course is they were only fit for writing regulations for toasters or landscaping green belts and not dealing with invading Muslims The rejects from German academia and banking had maneuvered into the upper hand at precisely the wrong point in history They fed Greece and then Greece fed them with with refugees Greece has been at the pay back game for a few thousand years Hungary Poland Czech and Slovakia have figured this out for once and are being quite rude about it and unwilling to take one for the idiots and slackers who run the EU and Germany 
Basically the same thing is happening in the US with variations and peculiarities specific to the place Combine the whored and fake credentialism of academia fascism of globalism to maintain transfer steal or grow wealth and the need to stick their credentialed fascist dumbass offspring somewhere and you have the EUBrussels AND the DC administration of Barack Obama And yes they are really stupid and lazy and incapable of dealing with much of anything including spotting fake passports The simplest government function escapes them

Yes yes yes They are the latest iteration of the REMITTANCE MAN the spawn of the upper class gutter with their fancy credentials and dissolute lives    paid to stay away from the home country A fine sense of history and British culture tells us exactly who they are
Within Victorian British culture a remittance man was understood to be the black sheep of an upper class family who was sent away from the United Kingdom to the Empire and paid to stay away These men were generally of dissolute or drunken character and may have been sent overseas after one or more disgraces at home 8220Remittance men8221 also lived in several towns in the American 1 and Canadian West 23 There were also 8216remittance women8217 but they are rarely discussed in scholarly works Many remittance men were sent to the Australian Colonies
American writer Mark Twain and Canadian poet Robert Service make references to those specific 8220remittance men8221 in some of their literary works The term was in casual use in Alaska until the late 20th century usually with a derogatory intent4 Judith Wright 1915 2000 wrote poetry on the remittance man
In past commercial mass entertainment novels the dark side remittance man has been popularized An example of this usage is in Robert Louis Stevenson8217s book The Wrecker where the character Tommy Hadden is cast as the 8216remittance man82175 In the book
Tom Hadden known to the bulk of Sydney folk as Tommy was heir to a considerable property which a prophetic father had placed in the hands of rigorous trustees The income supported Mr Hadden in splendour for about three months out of twelve8212821282128211 the rest of the year he passed in retreat among the islands

		THE LAW OF THE YUKON
by
Robert Service
This is the law of the Yukon and ever she makes it plain
8220Send not your foolish and feeble send me your strong and your sane 8212
Strong for the red rage of battle sane for I harry them sore
Send me men girt for the combat men who are grit to the core
Swift as the panther in triumph fierce as the bear in defeat
Sired of a bulldog parent steeled in the furnace heat
Send me the best of your breeding lend me your chosen ones
Them will I take to my bosom them will I call my sons
Them will I gild with my treasure them will I glut with my meat
But the others 8212 the misfits the failures 8212 I trample under my feet
Dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain
Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters 8212 Go take back your spawn again

Well after his boffo performance Saturday Marco is going down like a headshot goose in the polls The headline should read  Adios muchacho companera de mi vida Or if you do not hablo espanol So Long Its Been Good To Know You
Now suddenly dramatically a new rising star As in next day on your dressing room they hung a star lets go on with the show The rising star Who else8211Kasich  That seasoned politico who looks like he got some of that toxic cocktail that Vlad used to dipatch a political rival 
Just look at that face And then that loud bark and why can8217t we all get along In fact the speech he should have made to Lehman Brothers when he was a director before le deluge 
But the worst of it is who he has in his corner8212that big meanie Sunnuni He is a major force in that state and knows where all the bodies are buried 
I have a personal vendetta against Sunnunu however because he was mean to Andrea I had hoped that Greenspan would scratch his eyes out to defend her honor But alas that did not happen So that ugly mcp got away with this I hate him I hate him I hate him

		Polls are just polls8230
The Republicans are the big story8230Because we know who8217s on top but that8217s about all we know The Democratic race is much easier to predict
Bernie Sanders is now beating Hillary Clinton by 16 points8211 56 to 40 after he lost a point overnight and she kept what she had
Undecided is up to 4 an increase of two points since yesterday
The tracking poll shows Sanders is too far ahead of Clinton for her to catch him by Tuesday
All she can do now is try to cut the margin her loss
But the Republican race is more complicated and the outcome is a mystery
Donald Trump stays in the top spot with 34 after dropping two points overnight
Then a tie for second8211at 138211after Marco Rubio lost a point and there was no change in Ted Cruz8217s support 
John Kasich and Jeb Bush also are now tied at 10 Kasich gained one point8230While Bush held steady
In the back of the GOP pack
Chris Christie gained a point and is now at 5 Carly Fiorina stays at four and Ben Carson is stuck on three
