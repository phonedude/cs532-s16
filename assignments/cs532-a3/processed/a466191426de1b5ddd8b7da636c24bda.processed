It8217s probably safe to say that it wasn8217t the salmon omeletsdoled out by the heaping plateful every morning for breakfast that got the Carolina Panthers to the Super Bowl Or the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
Or even the smoothie bar
But team nutritionist Jennifer Brunelli is confident that the perfectly balanced and yes truly enormous meals her crew prepared all season  some players consume more than 9000 calories a day played a role in the Panthers8217 success That8217s why she and her team packed up their equipment and moved their entire kitchen to San Francisco where the Panthers will face off on Sunday against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50

Can I replicate whats gone on every single week out there so that it feels as much like home as possible she said
That8217s quite a challenge The Panthers8217kitchen staff which is made up of five to eight chefson a given day serve breakfast and lunch five days a week to the playersTwo of the perpetualcrowd pleasers an omelet bar stocked with veggies turkey sausage and salsas and a 24hour smoothie station
Theyre out there constantly making smoothies Brunelli said

A formerAllAmerican swimmer at the University of South CarolinaBrunelli knows how important food is to an athlete
This year Brunelli overhauled her approach by ordering blood work for all the Panthers She hoped that would clue her in as to whether the players were deficient in any particular nutrients
She also gives out her cell number so players could call her with any questions as they prepared their own meals and they take her up on it Players texted her from the supermarket and from GNC They8217d ask if wasOK to eat red meat or whether to believe the salesman hawking a new product
She even got texts from players asking things like whether they should throw an extra slice of tomato on theirsandwich
Lately the Panthers have faced a new challenge It8217s been such a long hard grind to get to the Super Bowl that some players havestarted struggling to keep on weight
Weve had to hit it hard adding on calories and focusing on calorierich foods Brunelli said That8217s meant lots of starchy carbohydrates like grits and steelcut oats
While the beefy defensive linemeneat the most even the relatively little guys on the team aim for3500 calories a dayBrunelli discreetly declined to discuss particular players8217 diets
During practices they scarf down PBampJ and protein balls

And during games Brunelli keeps the sidelines stocked with snacks
What snacks exactly
That8217s top secret
All she8217ll say is that she has to be incredibly cautious about what she gives a playerto munch on during a game
You dont know how many plays before you go back in she said 8220it could be one or it could be 128221That means the snacks have to be simple and sparse to keep players from getting sick if they have to rush back on the field

On Sunday Brunelli will try to help the players sneak in a snack during halftime
And if the Panthers win Brunelli hasn8217t said what she might serve as a victory banquet
But she will say the Carolina Panthers really love their turkey meatloafTheyre just head over heels for that she said
