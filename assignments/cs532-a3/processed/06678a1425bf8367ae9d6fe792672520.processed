                For football players the goalpost is always in clear sight but for those on the sidelines cheering them the goal of getting paid a decent wage can feel a lot further away than 120 yards
Its been two years since an NFL cheerleader named Lacy Tnbspfiled a wagetheft lawsuitnbspagainst the Oakland Raiders claiming she was paid less than 5 an hour after mandatory appearances at events and rehearsals were factored innbspThe lawsuit touched off a megaphonelevel debate about fair pay workplace exploitation and the treatment of women in professional sports sparking a litigious chain reaction that reached far and wide throughout the worlds richest sports league
In the months that followed lawsuits were filed against NFL clubs such as the Buffalo Bills Cincinnati Bengals New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers Tired of exhaustive workouts and performing acrobatic dance routines for a pittance NFL cheerleaders sought back wages and benefits And many said it was about time nbspnbsp
Any organization is going to take advantage of you and exploit you until youve had enough said Lisa Murray a former NBA dancer who cheered professionally with Lacy T on the Golden State Warriorsnbspand has since gone on to be one of the most vocal advocates of fair cheerleader pay You have to know your rights and fight for them
But two years into that fight Murray and others on the front line concede that not much has changed both in the battle to improve working conditions and more crucially in the broader effort to change the culture within the NFL Four of the cheerleader lawsuits were settled with teams agreeing to pay out more than 25 million combined in back wages But they admitted no wrongdoing Whats more those teams that have fallen in line do not appear interested in going beyond what is legally required of them For instance the Raiders in 2014 began paying cheerleaders 9 an hour then Californias minimum wage Any hope that NFL cheerleaders would see wages that better reflect their contribution to the 9 billion colossus that is professional football have been dashed at least for now
Its moving in the right direction but its just moving slow said Diane Todd the mother of a highschool cheerleader in Santa Monica California whosenbsptwoyearold petitionnbspcalling on the NFL to pay cheerleaders a living wage has attracted more than 156000 signatures
The ongoing debate over cheerleader pay will no doubt bubble into the mass consciousness again Sundaynbspwhen the Denver Broncos face the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50 That the game will take place just outside San Francisco  a city infamous for its cavernous wage gap  is weirdly fitting Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning reportedly earned 2 million just for making it into the Super Bowl and he will double that amount in the event the Broncos win And all the players during the game can expect hefty bonuses 51000 for each player on the losing team and 102000 for the victors as ESPNnbspreported nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp
Representatives of the Broncos and the Panthers did not respond to multiple requests for comment on what their cheerleaders will be paid but its safe to say it will be on the lower end of the scale Pay for NFL cheerleaders still hovers around minimum wage at best and sometimesnbsplower lawsuits pegged the rate at about 100 to 150 a game Meanwhile Murray said cheerleaders are typically not paid bonuses for working the big game
They tell the woman they should feel lucky to go to the game and have all expenses paid so no one questions the system she said
In response to criticism of cheerleader wages NFL teams tend to emphasize that cheerleading is a parttime gig and that most cheerleaders either are fulltime college students or have primary jobs outside the squad Cheerleaders themselves enthusiastically and frequently admit that they do it out of the sheer love of football Nobody expects to make a living doing this Lacy T told International Business Times in an interviewnbsplast year
And of course NFL teams are quick to point out that cheerleading is fun and that women who are lucky enough to be chosen out of the thousands of hopefuls who audition each season are given an unrivaled platform to perform in front of millions of fans Exposure as the story goes is its own reward
Its a sales pitch we hear often from the gatekeepers of glamor industries and its one that sends Murray through the roof I have a million things to say about that she said If you look at any profession and say Well youre going to have fun and make a lot of friends so you should accept no money its the most outrageous thing The harsh reality is that for the community of women hired for this its just one big cycle of brainwashing
  
    








          
                  Prospective Denver Broncos cheerleaders practice a routine during auditions in Denver Cheerleader advocates say the NFL breeds a culture of privilege in which women who make the squad are told they are lucky to have been chosen and therefore should not expect much compensation

This is not to say there has been no progress Todd in Santa Monica noted that in the two years since she launched her petition awareness of the issue has increased dramatically and pressure applied by lawmakers is helping the cause She cited a September letter from 19 legislators spanning eight states asking NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to persuade teams to pay cheerleaders minimum wage and give them other employee benefits Public pressure is the only thing thats going to change this Todd said
When asked about the issue the league has traditionally replied by passing the buck saying cheerleader pay policies are the responsibility of the individual teams not the league But that stance rings hollow to cheerleader advocates who say the NFL as the trade association for professional football can and does wield considerable influence over team conduct and policies
More recently there are signs that NFL is at least paying attentionnbspJoanna Hunter a league representative told IBT in an email Thursday the organization strongly believes that all cheerleaders should receive fair wages for their work although she did not specify what the league considers fair She also said the NFL is working with all clubs who have squads to support and promote cheerleaders consistent with this goal
Murray who has been active in the movement since Lacy Ts lawsuit has also helped achieve some of its most concrete victories Last year she spoke outnbspin support of a proposed California labor law that would grant employee protections and benefits to cheerleaders with the NFL and other professional sports leagues The measure was introduced by California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego  a former cheerleader herself  and signed into law by Gov Jerry Brown in July
  
    








          
                  Lisa Murray left former NBA cheerleader with the Golden State Warriors stands with California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez after the state Senate Labor Committee passed a bill in 2015 that guarantees employee benefits to professional cheerleaders

On the other side of the country a similar bill is working its way through the state Legislature in New York That legislation followed a 2014 wagetheft lawsuit against the Buffalo Bills in which former members of the teams cheer squad the Jills claimed they were not paid minimum wage The teams response to the lawsuit was to suspend operations of the Jills but it may be too little too late Last month a judge approved class certificationnbspfor the case meaning the lawsuit could include as many as 40 cheerleaders per season over a sixseason period The Bills have told media outlets they plan to fight the ruling nbspnbsp
The Jills were classifiednbspas independent contractors which is a common arrangement in the NFL and one that critics say is a way for teams to shirk the responsibility of providing workplace protections Christopher Marlborough the lead attorney on the lawsuit against Bills said a litany of employeelike requirements were imposed onnbspthe cheerleaders including limiting their ability to fraternize with others and seek outside employment He said cheerleaders social media posts were monitored as wellnbspThe Bills have disclaimed responsibility as the rules were presented to the Jills through management companiesnbsp
Theres no circumstance where they would pass any smell test for independent contractor whatsoever Marlborough said The amount of control that was exerted over them was extraordinary even for an employeremployee relationship
In fact the Jills were at the forefront of the cheerleader wage fight The cheer squad voted to unionize back in 1995 a first for professional football But the effort was shortlived with the union disbanding after pressure applied by a sponsor as Bloomberg News reported
Murray said unionization of professional cheerleaders is an idea whose time has come She said she is in the beginning stages of speaking with people who can help set the process in motion although she admits it will be a long road ahead before cheerleader unions become a reality
An ideal situation would see a cheerleader union for each professional sports league she said similar to how players unions operate now While it may be accepted wisdom that NFL players are paid handsomely for their contributions to the game that wasnt always the case And Murray pointed out that the history of fairpay victories in professional sports is one of dogged determination and not taking no for an answer
No team is ever going to come out and say Yes Ill pay you more money because its the right thing to do she said Youre going to have to fight until the bitter end to get every cent possible
This article has been updated with additional information fromnbspMarlborough to clarify that the rules imposed on the Jills were presented through management companiesnbsp
