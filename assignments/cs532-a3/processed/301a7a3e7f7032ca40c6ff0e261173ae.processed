    mdashBy Josh Harkinson  Fri Feb 5 2016 600 AM ESTTweetEmail Rideshare UnitedFacebookA disruptive smartphone app turned Uber into a 50 billion global juggernaut Now a group of disgruntled Uber drivers with the help of their own smartphone app aims to kneecap the carhailing service precisely when and where it will be most in demand Super Bowl Sunday in the Bay Area

Striking drivers reportedly intend to slow traffic near the stadium and inundate the streets around crowded Super Bowl events

For Uber the stakes are high The big game is in Santa Clara about an hour from Ubers San Francisco headquarters The company has chipped in 250000 to 500000 in cash and services to sponsor the Super Bowl Host Committee according to Quartz In return it gets to be the first ridesharing service allowed to access a Super Bowl game It will even have exclusive pickup and dropoff zones at the stadiummdasha coup for Ubers marketing department assuming the company doesnt fall on its face

And thats where Ubers labor problems may come back to haunt it The drivers who often make less than minimum wage are angry because the company slashed fares nationwide over the past month On Monday several hundred of them protested at Ubers offices in San Francisco and New York

The group behind the San Francisco protest United Uber Drivers has pledged to hold a massive strike on Super Bowl Sunday and some Uber drivers in other cities have said they will do the same in solidarity According to the industry publication Ride Share Report the drivers intend to slow highway traffic near the stadium and inundate the streets around crowded Super Bowl events in San Francisco

That might not be all United Uber Drivers did not respond to emails from Mother Jones but downloading the groups special iPhone app offers a bit more insight into its plans



Other messages explain that when a push notification is received through the app all drivers will be asked to go offline simultaneously crippling Ubers network quotWe need you to invite every Uber driver you knowquot urges the first message written in November quotThis communication technology will allow us to invite unite and strike effectively without any fear or loss of the business relationship with Uberquot

But that might be easier said than done With an estimated 40000 Uber drivers in the Bay Area the group will need a lot of downloads to mount an effective strike Of course people said the same thing about some startups harebrained bid to defeat the taxi industry Uber proved them wrong
