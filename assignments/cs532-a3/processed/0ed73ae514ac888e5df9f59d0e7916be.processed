May 20 2015 by Nelson Cardoso 5 Comments Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce for Wings and Ribs
I swear May is a crazy weather month around here You can get a sunburn and heatstroke one day and frostbite the next Okay8230I8217m exaggerating a little bit but the start of this week has been pretty chilly compared to the summerlike hot weather we had on the long weekend that just passed Regardless this is still so much better than the freezing temperatures of the long winter we had so I8217ll stop complaining now You can8217t hold me to that though8230we8217re Canadians8230the weather though rarely any surprise is the number one topic of most smalltalk conversations 
Along with the heat and sunshine comes an appetite for grilling If it feels like summer we should cook like it8217s summer Nelson doesn8217t really break from barbecuing throughout the winter though8211he keeps a shovel on the deck to clear a path to the BBQ Nothing keeps him from firing up the grill year round But the thought of being outside in shorts8211BBQ tongs in one hand and an ice cold beer in the other hand8211does make him happy He8217s not even much of a beer drinker but he says it tastes extra good while he8217s grilling on the deck when the weather8217s hot
Now about this sauce8230Nelson has been working on this recipe for some time now He started with a mix of base bbq sauce recipes a couple of years ago ie apple cider vinegar brown sugar ketchup etc He kept adding to it until he found the perfect mix You can buy very decent sauces at the store and we have bought some delicious ones in the past Also this recipe won8217t save you money since it includes a full cup of Jack Daniel8217s but oh man it is amazing Nelson typically uses the sauce on ribs and wings both recipes coming soon but it can be used for almost anything that8217ll go with a good smokey BBQ sauce This sauce is thick so it8217ll really stick well to meat
Our boys and I love this stuff Nelson and Michael can handle more heat but Nelson keeps the heat to a minimum in this recipe so that even our little guy licks his fingers when he8217s done gnawing on a rib or a chicken wing If you like some heat add more Tabasco or whatever other hot sauce you please
Now get out there and do some grilling8211you know before the summer8217s over ouch We hope you enjoy this as much as we do
