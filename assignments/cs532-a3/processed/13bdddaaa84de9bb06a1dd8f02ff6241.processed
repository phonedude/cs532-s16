The symbol of the Five Per Cent Nation groupThe Five Percent Nation was founded in 1963 by Clarence Smith a former student of Malcolm X  Smith split off from the Nation of Islam after disagreeing over the idea of GodSmith changed his name to Allah and claimed that God wasnt a supernatural being but was found in all black men It was his assertion that black women did not possess God and were subordinates to black men but superior to white people who were considered weak wicked and inferiorThe FivePercenters get their name from the idea that only five per cent of humanity known the truth about existence and are poor righteous teachers trying to tell the rest of the world the truthAnother 10 per cent also know the truth but propagate a belief in a mystery God to the ignorant 85 per centClarence Smith died in 1969 after being murdered in his Harlem housing projectAuthor Michael Muhammad Knight who has published two books about the group told The New York Post The rationale is that the black man is God and created the universe and is physically stronger and intellectually stronger and more righteous naturally
