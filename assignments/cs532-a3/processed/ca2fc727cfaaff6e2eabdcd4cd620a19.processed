          Never underestimate the power of schadenfreude to drive television ratings From Mike Wallace cornering scheming businessmen on 60 Minutes to Cops to Donald Trump firing smug MBAs on The Apprentice people have always tuned in to television programs that offer the chance that something bad will happen to people they dont approve of
That may be part of whats been driving the ratings successes of the 2016 Republican presidential debates Trump may have left his reality television show behind when he decided to launch a presidential run but hes brought an element of what makes that kind of TV so popular to the campaign

Specifically it looks as though people who generally dont approve of the participants in the Republican debates ie Democrats are tuning in to watch them in very high numbers And its hard not to assume that the possibility of some sort of livetelevision political train wreck isnt part of the appeal

Jeffrey Gottfried and Elisa Shearer of the Pew Research Center ran the numbers on how many Republicans have watched both GOP and Democratic debates versus how many Democrats have watched debates from both parties The difference was striking Just under half of Republicans who watched their own party debate tuned in to the Democrats as well But 70 percent of Democrats who watched their own partys debates also viewed at least one of the GOP events
Overall Republicans are watching presidential debates at higher rates than both Democrats and independents 64 percent compared with 53 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of independents they found But among those who do watch debates seveninten Democrats who have seen at least one watched a Republican debate compared with about half 49 of Republicans who watched a Democratic debate
Unsurprisingly the more of their own partys debates they watched the more likely Democrats were to have watched the GOP debates as well

Indeed 89 of Democrats who watched more than one debate watched debates for both parties much higher than the corresponding share of Republicans 59 percent Gottfried and Shearer wrote  In contrast about fourinten 41 percent Republicans who viewed multiple debates only watched those for the Republican candidates compared with a mere 8 percent of Democrats who watched only Democratic debates
The question of whether it is Trumps presence that has been driving the ratings of the GOP debates  as he insists  will be tested tonight Trump has very publicly declined to participate in the sixth presidential debate and that may keep Democrats  and a lot of Republicans  from tuning in
