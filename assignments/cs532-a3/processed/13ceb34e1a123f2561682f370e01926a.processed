The teams went through walkthroughs Saturday before Panthers quarterback Cam Newton claimed both NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year honors later that night Panthers coach Ron Rivera was the NFL Coach of the Year and Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips was named the leagues assistant of the year

SUPER BOWL Ranking the games 49 winners  Best Super Bowl losers
With Newton at quarterback the Panthers had the NFLs highestscoring offense and will contend with Phillips topranked defense that led the NFL in sacks
After Carolinas practice Saturday which focused on situational football like twominute drills and varying downs and distances Rivera used the samehays in the barn expression
Rivera and Kubiak both said all 53 of their players are ready to go Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis will play despite suffering a broken arm two weeks ago Defensive end Jared Allen will be on the field despite a broken foot that kept him out of the NFC championship game
For the Broncos safeties TJ Ward ankle and Darian Stewart knee will play as will guard Louis Vasquez who has not practiced much over the last two weeks because of an injured knee
Both teams have story lines for which to root Newton can become the first player in NFL history to win a Super Bowl after previously winning league MVP a college national championship and Heisman Trophy Davis missed part of the 2009 season all of 2010 and most of 2011 after suffering three ACL injuries Now in his 11th season Davis was a firsttime Pro Bowl selection this year and the Panthers can get him and fellow longtime veterans Allen and Charles Tillman their first rings
For the Broncos its all about letting the Sheriff ride off into the sunset on top Super Bowl 50 will likely be the final game for quarterback Peyton Manning who is in his 18th season and fourth Super Bowl Manning 39 went 12 in his previous three big games but like former Broncos quarterbackand current team general managerJohn Elway Manning can walk away from the game as a champion Another aging Broncos player is outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware who can get his first championship in his 11th NFL season
Theres also Broncos receiver Demaryius Thomas who will have his mother in attendance after she was released from prison six months ago after serving 15 years for a drug conviction
Both teams were inside an empty Levis Stadium on Saturday for team photos but by the time kickoff arrives at 330 local time 630 pm ET the home stadium of the 49ers will be packed and full of pomp and spectacle
I just feel really good about it Rivera said Saturday via a pool report I think we have a great group of young men who have really earned this opportunity and hopefully well understand what it means and take advantage of it
