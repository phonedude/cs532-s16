		Denver Broncos vs Carolina Panthers 8211 Super Bowl 50	

	
		Super Bowl50 8211 Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers square off in Santa Clara California
The Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers will square off in Super Bowl 50 The Panthers have a top ranked scoring offense and the Broncos have the No 1 defense in passing and total yards Both teams have enjoyed their success due to great defenses The Panthers are the early 45 point favorite The Super Bowl between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers will be played on Sunday February 7 2016 at 630 pm ET at Levis Stadium The game will be broadcast on CBS
The Denver Broncos defense demonstrated a great pass rush against New England during the AFC championship game last Sunday Tom Brady was rushed hit and sacked throughout the game Denver forced four sacks and three interceptions Denvers defense had great success against Brady but the Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has an elusiveness that Brady does not have Denver quarterback Peyton Manning and the offense have not consistent this season The Denver offense looked much better against New England but they will have to face a different caliber of defense against Carolina
The Carolina Panthers rolled over Arizona in the NFC championship game with an impressive defensive showing as well The defense forced the Cardinals to turn it over four times in the first half The key matchup will be the Carolina offensive line against the Denver defensive front The strength of the Carolina line has been a pleasant surprise led by center Ryan Kalil Also CamNewton has the ability to run with the ball when the defense poses a threat in the pocket The Panther8217s tackles might be over matched by Denver8217s outside rushers in Miller and DeMarcus Ware Offensive tackles Mike Remmers and Michael Oher have held up well but this will be a tough task The team that wins the turnover battle usually wins the final game of the season No team had more takeaways in the regular season than the Panthers Super Bowl 50 might come down to which offensive line can play the best
