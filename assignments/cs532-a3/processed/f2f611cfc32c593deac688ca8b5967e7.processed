Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning gained 12 yards on a thirdand10 run in the third quarter of the AFC championship game against the New England Patriots on Jan 24 It was his longest run of the season Associated Press



In the third quarter of the AFC championship game Peyton Manning did something he almost never does He ran For several yards

Two Cents Peyton Manning a shell of QB he used to be

3 Weeks Ago








You didnt see it coming Neither did the New England Patriots
Manning the quarterback whose career is supposed to be on its last legs used his legs to pick up 12 precious yards and a first down
Later in the broadcast CBS made a claim that seemed as unbelievable as Mannings run was unexpected Old Man Manning the network said reached a peak speed of 17 mph

 

 
 



What
That rickety statuesque quarterback The one who has had four neck surgeries The one who suffered a torn plantar fascia in November He did that In pads At 39 years old
Well tell you the answer
But first lets marvel at the rarity of what we witnessed
 In a career that has spanned almost 300 games Manning has gained at least 12 yards on a run just 18 previous times Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton his counterpart Sunday in Super Bowl 50 has gained at least 12 yards on a run 14 times this season
 Mannings run against the Patriots was his longest of the season and his longest since he ran for 27 yards on Dec 26 2010 On that day Manning was wearing an Indianapolis Colts uniform and Tim Tebow was the quarterback who led the Denver Broncos in a fourthquarter comeback
 In the playoffs Manning gained doubledigit yards on just one other run  a 15yard touchdown scramble against the Tennessee Titans in January 2000 Eleven days later President Bill Clinton delivered his final State of the Union address
After CBS noted Mannings speed disbelief flooded Twitter timelines

 

 
 




 

 
 




 

 
 




 

 
 



We were skeptical too So we sought out how CBS came up with its precise number
In 2014 the NFL started installing nicklesized radio frequency identification chips developed by Zebra Technologies under most players shoulder pads The chips emit signals 15 times per second to receivers mounted in stadiums transmitting data that helps determine how fast a player is running where and how far In 2014 17 stadiums used the technology by the start of this season every stadium was equipped
Television networks have nearinstant access to the data which they use occasionally for onair graphics In time teams might use the data to inform game strategy and scouting
We wanted to check the math on the broadcast the oldfashioned way so we reached out to John Eric Goff professor of physics at Lynchburg College in Virginia and author of Gold Medal Physics The Science of Sports
Goff downloaded video of the play formatted at 30 frames per second and analyzed it frame by frame To gauge the accuracy of CBS meter he focused on the portion of Mannings run where he ran parallel to the sideline

He found it took Manning 053 seconds to run from the 23yard line to the 27yard line or 755 yards per second which converts to an average speed of 1544 mph
But what about Mannings maximum speed in that span As Manning approached each yard marker Goff noted the elapsed time Because Goff was working off the broadcast camera angle he estimated the error in his model is 10 percent or less
quotThat process allows me to find his speed at each instant in time instead of the average speedquot he said quotYour speedometer gives you instantaneous speed not average speedquot
Anyone want to talk about sixthorder time polynomials and velocity components
No
Okay then the bottom line is this According to Goffs calculations Manning hit 1635 mph in that 4yard span
For reference Usain Bolt recognized as the worlds fastest man reached 2779 mph during his record 958second 100meter run in 2009 Panthers receiver Ted Ginn arguably the NFLs fastest man passed 22 mph on a 74yard touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons in December peak speed of an actual panther about 35 mph

So it turns out that as unbelievable as it seemed at the time CBS speedometer measure of 17 mph was in Goffs view about right
quotEven though when he ran that play Manning was exactly two months shy of his 40th birthday a great 6foot5 athlete like him with a long stride length can if only for a split second sneak into 16mph to 17mph speed range with pads on and huge younger guys chasing himquot he said
At the very least this should make those of us who boast we could jump off the couch and outrun Peyton Manning feel a little less confident 
A more realistic bar Dwight Schrute of The Office fame hit 13 mph when running past a radar speed sign
