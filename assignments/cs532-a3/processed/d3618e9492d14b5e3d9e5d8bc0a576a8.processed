Citizens today is Super Bowl Sunday meaning it is once again time to post a recipe worthy of the Big Game and tailgating outside the stadium in Santa Clara beforehand
Since TFD is from the center of the Universe aka Brooklyn NYC 8211 this recipe originating not far from my birthplace is overdue for your consideration
A Coney Island Hot Dog or Coney Dog or Coney is a natural casing hot dog in a bun topped with a Balkan spiceinfluenced savory meat sauce and sometimes other toppings 
It is often offered as part of a menu of dishes of Greek origin and classic American 8216diner8217 dishes and often at Coney Island restaurants It is largely a phenomenon related to immigration from Greece and the Macedonian region to the United States in the early 20th century
Virtually all Coney Island variations were developed apparently independently by Greek or Macedonian immigrants in the early 1900s many fleeing the Balkan wars who entered the US through Ellis Island in New York City Family stories of the development of the dishes often included anecdotes about visits to Coney Island
In 1913 the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce in New York had banned the use of the term 8220hot dog8221 on restaurant signs on Coney Island an action prompted by concerns about visitors taking the term literally and assuming there was dog meat in the sausage
Because of this action by the Chamber of Commerce immigrants passing through the area didn8217t know the sausage in a bun by the American moniker 8220hot dog8221 Instead the handheld food would have been known to immigrants as a 8220coney island8221
 CITIZENS TRYThe Hirshon Sichuan Chili Oil  While still very popular in NYC the Coney has become supremely popular in Michigan as well as Indiana Ohio North Dakota Wisconsin Texas and Oklahoma The key difference between Midwest Coneys and NYC is that NYC coneys use ground beef and Midwestern Coneys also add ground beef heart 
My version is NYCbased to the core plus it also includes the TFD Magic touches that distinguish all my recipes
Enjoy the Big Game Citizens
