    In Defense of Moderates
    
      Spandan Chakrabarti
      February  4 2016
    
  
    
  
  

  With the primaries in full swing candidates from both extremes and their supporters are busy attempting to paint their competitors for their respective partys nomination as moderates The Republican party neutered its moderates long ago when unadulterated hatred for the Black Usurper in the White House became the first  and only  qualification of being a RepublicanBut some on the Left have been seeking the same trend for a while wanting to push out moderates from the Democratic party and make the party into a weapon for angry fights with the GOP rather than a vehicle of progress Like the Tea Party takeover of the GOP this cadre of the Left cares more about winning a pillow fight than winning an election more about bloodying their opponents than forging a path forwardnbspThis Left swaths adulation has culminated on Bernie Sanders whose actual record of progressivism at best is incompleteBoth extremes see moderates as wishywashy weak compromisers that lack a moral core This moral core according to the extremists is defined by a fundamentalist loyalty to ideological rigidity and a blind adulation for whichever candidate happens to the bona fide deity of the day for that fundamentalist rigidityA Funny Gateskeeper of ProgressivismYesterday Bernie Sanders the Lefts current deity released a slew of posts on Twitter that amounted to casting Hillary Clinton out of the True Progressive Religion TM that he is now the messiah of He conveniently left out his own inadequacies on progressive issues of course like the utter inability to address racial injustice distinctly from economic inequalitynbspa health care plan to end abortion access for poor and working women numerous votes against gun violence victims votes against the Brady bill and to protect gun manufacturers and his vote to protect an armed racist border militia groupNonetheless his point  one that he reiterated in last nights CNN Town Hall in New Hampshire  was that one cannot be both a moderate and a progressive Hillary Clinton said Saint Bernie is a moderate not that theres anything wrong with that he condescendingly added not a progressive Clinton countered saying she is a progressive who gets things doneI notsohumbly submit that not only is moderation a necessity for progressives to get things done moderates are a key part of the progress we make  not only because selfidentified liberals have yet to form a quarter of American voters but because moderates play a key role in ensuring the future success of progressive legislationWhat is Progressive What is a ModerateAs has been pointed out here numerous times progressive doesnt mean anything without progress To make progress holding rallies on college campuses and yelling about income inequality are not enough It takes hard work the ability to identify common goals with people who are not ideologically coaligned and critically the willingness and ability to compromise Just harping on purity and rejecting some progress because it in your opinion is not enough progress can make you an ideologue a debater a critic and even an advocate but it cannot make you a progressiveThis is why moderates are more important in the progressive movement than they are to conservatives While I dont identify as a moderate in politics I can say this moderates are not people who lack a moral core but rather those who reject extremism and believe that contemporary solutions to contemporary problems lie somewhere in the middle of the ideological spectrumModerates may not always be pioneers on issues of the greatest moral importance but they are the ones who are persuadable They may not have believed in marriage equality from the start but it was Democrats willing to persuade them that we should not write discrimination into the Constitution that kept the Federal Marriage Amendment from passing and forever wiping out the hope of legalizing marriage equalityModerates may not be for socialized medicine but the vast progress we have made in health coverage since Medicare  namely childrens health insurance and insurance reform under Obamacare  were only possible because people who did not see themselves necessarily aligned with any given political ideology too had children neighbors parents and friends who were being denied health coverageAnother  perhaps a more accurate  way to describe moderates is they are people who use different framesets to look at different problems Someone may be prochoice in favor of expanding health care through public programs and universal preschool and yet believe in an interventionist foreign policy Someone may believe that global warming must be dealt with urgently and yet believe in charter schools and testing Moderates may in most circumstances  certainly Democratic moderates  may be described as partial progressivesWhy Moderation  and Moderates  Are Inextricable Partners in ProgressThe Democratic party first and foremost is a party of ideas That is why its a big tent nbspparty There are liberal Democrats moderate Democrats and yes even conservative Democrats Unlike the GOP the Democratic Party is not an ideological monolith and neither should be anyone seeking to be its standard bearer Moderates play a critical role in the Democratic partys capacity to governFirst moderates ground us They ask the questions ideological thinking often misses They remind think tanks of the realities of the kitchen table They force us to ask for each policy proposal whether it will actually make real peoples lives better rather than just help us fight our perceived enemies in the establishment They raise the issues of what if that are so critical in formulating practical legislation not just white papersEven when progressives need to advance policies without a broad consensus of moderates listening to and addressing the concerns of the moderates makes it more likely that what passed as partisan today will become mainstream tomorrow endure and be expanded This is how broad social safety net programs like Social Security Medicare food stamps housing assistance student assistance childrens health insurance and finally the Affordable Care Act were enactedModerates do not want revolution but they are open to evolution  significant changes that over time add up to big transformations I can see how that is problematic for BernieBros to accept but that is how change happens  this is how progress takes placeAnd because moderates are part of this story of progress they too can be progressives Progress is not an ideology it is a process For progressives it is a process of building a society with greater justice better health equal opportunity broader prosperity unity within diversitynbspgreater cooperation fewer conflicts Anyone who is a partner in that journey is helping us make progress moderates includedThe Democratic Party Must Embrace ModeratesDespite my comfort with the selfdefinition of a progressive and a liberal I am tired of seeing fellow Democrats who identify as moderates being cornered or squeezed out of our party I am tired of the Lefts fundamentalists vilifying moderates and attempting to make moderate a dirty word in the Democratic primary I am tired of seeing a woman who has served the cause of progress all her life being crucified for her pragmatic approach by those who prefer podium pounding over making progressThis is a critical moment in this history of the Democratic party We must not be swept into the hands of ideological extremists If we do we stand to lose our identity not just as the big tent party but as the progressive party Moderates must have a voice in our party Moderate voices cannot be shut out of the Democratic party
