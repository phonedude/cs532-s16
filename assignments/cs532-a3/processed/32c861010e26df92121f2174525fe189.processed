Core standards Patrick SemanskyAP   By Michael Alison Chandler November 30 2015  Follow michaelalison    Twentyfive percent of the students in third grade through eighth grade in the District met or exceeded expectations on new standardized tests in English last spring and 24percent met a new benchmark on updated math tests according to results released Monday by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education  Proficiency rates were much higher for white students in the District than for Hispanic and African American students  White students had a proficiency rate of 79 percent in English and 70 percent in math For Hispanic students the proficiency rate was 21 percent in English and 22 percent in math Black students had a 17 percent proficiency rate in both English and math These results are sobering DC Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson said in a statement But we know our students can meet the new higher standard we set for ourselves  A little more than half of District students scored in the lowest two of five performance levels on both tests demonstrating that they did not meet or only partially met expectations  Scores were particularly low for specialeducation students who had a 4 percent proficiency rate on both tests  The scores offer a look at how District students are performing on the Common Core State Standards designed to increase the depth and rigor of what the nations public school students are learning The updated standards began to roll out in 2012 and have largely shaped the academic curriculum for the youngest test takers  The new tests first administered last spring are known as the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers exams  or PARCC  and were developed by a consortium of 11 states including Maryland and the District  DC officials called it a more honest look at how students are performing compared with the citys former test the DC CAS on which 54percent of students scored proficient in math and 50 percent in English in 2014 The benchmark for proficiency on the new test is designed to align with skills students need to be considered on track for collegelevel work or a career upon high school graduation   DC adopts national proficiency level for its new PARCC tests  Results for elementary and middle school students were released about a month after results for the citys high school students which showed that just 10 percent of District students who took a new geometry test and 25 percent of students who took the new high school English test met proficiency standards The achievement gap also was stark in high school with 52percent of white students scoring proficient or better on the geometry test compared with 8 percent of Hispanic students and 4percent of black students Eightytwo percent of white students met the collegeready target in English compared with 25percent of Hispanic students and 20 percent of black students  One in 10 DC students score college ready on new high school math test   District officials said they are optimistic that scores will improve over time because younger students scored better than high school students overall  On the math test 50 percent of third through eighthgrade students scored 3 or better on a 5point scale compared with 34percent of the high school test takers  The strongest scores were in the earliest grades 30 percent of thirdgraders scored a 4 or better compared with 21 percent of sixthgraders  Middle school scores were the lowest though students in accelerated classes who took algebra or geometry tests had higherthanaverage proficiency rates  In English language arts 49percent of students scored a 3 or higher compared with 42percent of the high school test takers but proficiency rates were more consistent across third through eighth grade  Proficiency rates for students in charter and traditional schools were the same on the English test a quarter of students met or exceeded expectations in both types of schools  But charter students outperformed the city average in math with 26 percent meeting the collegeready target compared with 23 percent of students in traditional public schools  Traditional schools also had more students score in the lowest level on both tests In math 24percent of students in traditional schools performed on the first of five levels compared with 16 percent of charter students In English 31 percent scored on the lowest level compared with 22percent of charter students    Michael Alison Chandler writes about schools and families in the Washington region
