    CINCINNATI  The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardensrsquo predictions for Super Bowl 50 are in and they39re unanimous Komodo dragon Hudo river otter Sugar and king penguins BB Larry and Martin Luther all picked the Carolina Panthers to win the big game

	
While watching the zoorsquos team of prognosticators waddle swim and topple their way through their predictions is great fun for human viewers the activity is beneficial to the animals too Itrsquos called enrichment  Gone are the days of animalsrsquo looking bored in tiny enclosures said Wendy Rice head keeper of the Africa exhibit All Association of Zoos and Aquariums member zoos mdash like the Cincinnati Zoo mdash offer enrichment as a tool to engage excite and challenge animals by enhancing their environmentAnimals in captivity have no natural worries Rice said They donrsquot have to forage for food defend territory or avoid predators Instead she said zoo animals have lots of free time Enrichment keeps them occupied both mentally and physicallyldquoEnrichment is a ton of fun and itrsquos becoming a bigger and bigger part of zoosrdquo she saidldquoFor example the lions love chewing obviously Theyrsquore all about tearing things up and ripping into carcasses and hunting different thingsrdquo Rice said ldquoSo we try to come up with items they could either play with or wrestle with something that is big enough to simulate a prey item that they can tackle to the groundrdquoIn January 2015 the Cincinnati Zoo formed its own volunteer enrichment program to provide even more experiences for their residents Last year the team constructed 239 enrichment devices according to zoo volunteer Jen Moormeier including everything from papermache birthday cakes to hammocks and balls constructed from firehose to challenging puzzle feeders made from PVCFor one of their first projects Moormeier said they crafted a cupcake filled with treats for Lana the orangutanrsquos 30th birthday complete with a carrot on top resembling a candle ldquoIt was total successrdquo she saidldquoShe tore it open to get all the treats mdash thatrsquos foraging and itrsquos a natural behavior Anything we build we try to mirror their natural behavior So we try to help them simulate things that they would do in the wildrdquo

	
Before each device is built Moormeier said it must be approved by a team of zoo veterinarians keepers and nutritionists to ensure its safety and appropriateness Once the green light is given she said it takes the group about two weeks to complete a project depending on availability of material She said that when a keeper comes to them with an approved design idea their first response is always ldquoyesrdquo Then they figure out the logisticsldquoWe have a team of about 20 people who have a variety of expertise across the board mdash a very amazing team of expertsrdquo she said ldquoWe have artists engineers tech people military vets so itrsquos a very eclectic group of people So you leverage everybodyrsquos expertise to do whatever project wersquove gotrdquoWorking on materials for special events is especially fun for the group she said like creating the papermache footballs and helmets for the Super Bowl as well as goal posts for the penguins Next she said theyrsquoll be gearing up for Valentinersquos Day with plenty of heartthemed items and well as papermache treatfilled imitation Hershey KissesldquoLast year we did a kissing booth that was on the outside of the exhibit and our snow leopards came up to the booth so you could take an Instagram or selfie thererdquo she said ldquoThe keepers put some scents and treats up by the window so it heightens their curiosity and they came right over for photo opsrdquoThe Africa residents are provided with different types of enrichment every day Rice said On one morning they inserted two large cylinders in the lion enclosure which went unnoticed until one of the cubs knocked one over Moments later male John not only successfully commandeered the object but managed to wrestle with it then accidentally roll it down the hill into the water As the lions watched the cylinder float away Rice explained that things sometimes donrsquot always go as plannedldquoWe got a bubble machine one time and thought lsquoItrsquos going to be great Everybody is going to love the bubblesrsquordquo she said ldquoThe dogs loved it and they were bouncing hopping and popping bubbles and playing And we brought it over here to the lions and they were freaked out Our ostrich was popping bubbles out on the savanna our pelicans were interested but our hoofstock seemed scared of it So you never knowrdquoBesides introducing devices to animalsrsquo environment Rice explained that different scents sounds shapes and colors can also act as stimulation She said zoo visitors and activity outside their enclosures also act as enrichment as animals are always looking for new things For example she said the lions became completely engrossed with a blimp that had flown in for a special event and spent the entire afternoon staring at itldquoAnother huge part of enrichment is operant conditioningrdquo she said ldquoSo any time you can ask animals to use their brains their bodies and kind of do that problem solving by working with you and get reinforcement thatrsquos also very enriching Itrsquos the same way that humans train to play a sport and do it right and it feels really goodrdquoFinding new types of enrichment that resonate with animals is especially rewarding and Wise said the zoo shares successful ideas with other zoos ldquoWe just literally spend all day everyday trying to keep the animals happy and content and enrichment plays such a big partrdquo
