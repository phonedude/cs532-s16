				Coldplay have spoken to NME about their expectations ahead of playing the Super Bowl halftime show which will take place in the early hours of tomorrow morning February 8 UK time kick off between the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos is at 1130 pm UK time this evening

Jonny Buckland and Will Champion spoke to NME ahead of their performance describing the chance to play the highprofile show as surreal

It felt pretty good Buckland said about being asked Will and I went to it last year to watch the game Its so big that you cant even begin to think about it

Champion describes the gig as slightly terrifying but also as a huge opportunity A lot of our favourite bands or acts have done it Its a bit too big to comprehend Were treating it as weve got twelve minutes to play lets try and do as well as we can So much goes into it but its one of those things where you never really know whats going to happen on the day

Both admitted to being nervous about the performance

The half time show is a longstanding tradition on Super Bowl Sunday with previous performers in recent years including Beyonce Katy Perry the Red Hot Chili Peppers Madonna and The Who The short sets see members of the crowd allowed onto the pitch and feature between four and eight tracks depending on the amount of medleys and how quickly the stage can be put together

Beyonce and Bruno Mars are expected to join Coldplay for tonights performance at the Levi Stadium in Santa Clara California Metallica already played a preSuper Bowl show last night as headliners of an annual night before event

In the UK the Super Bowl is being shown on BBC 2 with coverage starting at 11pm Last years worldwide audience for American footballs headline event was estimated at 160 million
