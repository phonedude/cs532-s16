                                     SUPER BOWL 50 RECAP  Nailed it Denver easily won the game and covered the spread and the game went very much the way I predicted it even hitting my MVP prediction in Von Miller at 221 odds although a blowout is not what I expected  Cam Newton clearly has some growing up to do and what was up with him not jumping on that fumble He said that wasnt why they lost the game but give me a break man  It was a 6 point game at that point and had he recovered they could have punted and easily gotten the ball back for another chance to score and pull aheadso crazy    In the end I won 4 units on the Broncos and another 1875 units on Props  That concludes my Playoff run with a whopping 18125 units in profit with a 1251 ATS record 705 and a final winning streak of 8 weeks  In fact since Week 8 I banked just over 50 unitshello summer vacation    Im sad to see the season end but Im also pretty amped to regroup and begin working on all the new features we have planned for the site  Heres a few were working on right now   1  Data Center  I use a lot of game statistics yards per attempt yards per carry 3rd and 4th down s defensive QBR etc when I do my analysis and currently I need to either do my own backofthenapkin calculations or go to another website to get these stats  Well thats going to change  Were developing a data center so that Black Box Sports can provide ALL data and information needed to analyze a game  The goal is to make it so that the only information I use is also available to you on this site Look out for this over the Spring and possibly even by the end of Winter  If youve REGISTERED we will also send a note when this is available   2  Pools  Were looking into building a platform for pools specifically Survivor and Confidence Pools  If we do get this up for next season you will be able to create your own pools and invite your friendscoworkers  I would probably also start a fun pool for free potentially for some prizes as well cash is probably preferred right  Again if youve REGISTERED we will send a note when this is available   3  Community Features  Were looking into various ways so that you and the rest of the BBS community can share your thoughts opinions picks etc on the games and even compete with each other  I think Pools are a good first step to this but we know we can do more  I dont know if we will have a forum yet many of you have asked me for this but were looking into it    4  NBA Model  This one is more of a longshot to get prepped anytime soon but were trying  Getting the data is a bit of a challenge as is reformatting and prepping it so we can actually create a projection Model for it  Bestcase scenario we will have something in the works for next season but it would be in Beta phase only  In that case I probably wouldnt put it up on the site right away but I may tweetpost out the projections and recommended leans through my social media channels belowstay tuned for this     On top of all that were going to keep upgrading the Guru Picks page pick tracking data insights etc and provide more information on what the Model is and how I use it  I dont know if ALL of this will get done this offseason but were certainly going to try If you have any other ideas PLEASE shoot me a message and let me know  SOCIAL MEDIA  CONNECT WITH US  On that note if you do want to reach out of if youre interested in hearing about our progress and new developments as we go please do connect with us  Theres 3 ways we have to reach you right nowdo all 3  1	 REGISTER  with the us  2	Follow me on Twitter bbsportsguru   3	Like us on  Facebook   You can also reach me via email at bbsportsgurugmailcom Thanks for checking out the site and we look forward to making it even better for you next season

                                         PANTHERS OFF vs BRONCOS DEF  
Cam Newton just keeps on rolling and is easily going to walk away with MVP honors despite losing his stud receiver Kelvin Benjamin in training camp and playing behind an Oline that was basically thrown together with duck tape and glue during the offseason Oher truly a remarkable accomplishment  None of that however matters in this game  A lot of the skepticism surrounding the Panthers coming into the playoffs was their soft schedule particularly the defenses they played  In fact the best defense they played in the regular season according to our Power Rankings was the Eagles 5th back in week 7  After that the top ranked defense was actually the Cardinals last week although I wrote last week that there were concerns with some key injuries on the Cards D  The Broncos on the other hand easily have the best defense in the league and are actually historically great  The Orange crush lead the NFL in both net YPA and YPC this season becoming just the 4th team since the 1970 merger to pull off that feat 2008 Steelers 1991 Eagles and 1987 Bears so I think its safe to say that Cam has never played a defense of this caliber in his short career 
 So how will the Panthers attack Well its a safe bet that theyre not going to all of sudden move away from what got them here in the first place which is establishing the run and using that to open up the deep passing attack  Ive written before that I think Stewart is overrated that doesnt mean hes bad by the way but gets a lot of praise because of how good the offense has been overall  He only had 986 yards on 242 carries during the regular season 41 YPC and that includes the Eagles Redskins Saints twice Colts Giants and Packers  all bottom10 run defenses  on the schedule  As previously stated the Broncos led the league in stuffing the run so I dont see why Stewart would run wild on them 
 Of course the Panthers rushing attack is much more dynamic than just Stewart considering Cam Newton has a run package all for himself  Im actually not sure how the Broncos will fair against Camruns  They havent played any QBs this year that need to be accounted for in the run game the way Cam needs to be  They do play in the same division as Alex Smith who is a good scrambler but thats not the same thing as a designed run  With that in mind I can say with confidence that Cam will have more success than Stewart and the rest of the backfield for that matter when his number is called which is significant considering he could get 10 carries in this game he had 10 against the Cardinals 2 kneel downs and 11 against the Seahawks 3 kneel downs 
 Thats important because I dont see Newton having a good game aerially  I know hes had a good season including some big games passing but he simply doesnt have the weapons or experience to pull it off against a very talented Broncos secondary in my opinion  Chris Harris and Aqib Talib can easily take care of Ginn and Funchess which is going to leave Cam as a massive target for a sick pass rush from Von Miller Demarcus Ware and Derek Wolfe Thats not good because Cam has made some questionable throws this year which hes gotten away with up until now but I question his ability to keep that up against Denvers top ranked passing defense  If hes not careful those decisions could result in some turnovers which could be devastating for a Panthers team that is used to playing with a lead That said Gronkowski just had a massive game against the Broncos so I dont see why Olsen couldnt have similar success especially if they can isolate him on TJ Ward who is a great tackler but notsogood in coverage 
 BRONCOS OFF vs PANTHERS DEF  
The other side of the ball is less complicated at least on paper  Peyton Manning still leads the Broncos and while hes played mistakefree playoff football for the most part at least in terms of avoiding the backbreaking turnovers that plagued the first half of his 2015 campaign hes still limited physically The biggest problem I think is the lack of zip on his passes right now which hes going to need against a very fast Panthers stop unit that thrives on turnovers 20 turnover ratio in the regular season 8 in the playoffs 
 With that in mind not all hope is lost for Peyton when he does drop back to pass  Not only does he have some incredible experience going for him but he also has arguably the highest football IQ in the game which will help him take care of the ball  I wrote about this last week but behind Josh Norman the Panthers happen to be very thin in the secondary after both Charles Tillman and Bene Benwikere were lost for the season due to injury That means next to Norman the Panthers will start Robert McClain who was signed as a FA on December 15th and Cortland Finnegan who was also a FA until signed on November 30th Its amazing to me that Palmer wasnt able to take advantage of this last week but he looked like a drunken deer in the headlights for whatever reason  Peyton is not better than Palmer at this point in his career but he is at least smart enough to know his limitations  as well as the Panthers  and play within them and for that reason I think he will find some spots in key moments to take advantage of with Demaryius Thomas Emmanuel Sanders and Owen Daniels 
 That said since Peyton does know his limitations  and everyone does at this point  he will 100 try and establish the run and stick with it for the full 60 mins  The Panthers held opponents to just 39 YPC on the season which is good enough for top10 but that also means they arent impregnable as Tyson would say  David Johnson is a great example of this actually  he was slicing thru the Panthers run defense before the Cardinals had to abandon the run early  CJ Anderson and Ronnie Hillman arent the best backs especially the latter  and neither are as good as David Johnson  but theyre good enough to keep the Panthers honest and open up some holes in the secondary for Peyton and co  They ran the ball well against the Steelers and Patriots both of which are as good or better in the Steelers case at stopping the run as the Panthers are so why cant that continue  
 The matchup on the ground is soooo important not just because it opens up favorable matchups in the passing game but also because it will protect Peyton from the pass rush by making Kawann Short and sackspecialist Mario Addison hesitate before pinning their ears back  The Broncos offensive line has been shaky all season so if the Panthers have free reign to rush Peyton he will be in for a long day  Of course Peyton will also utilize various snap counts to help in this regard as well side note  this could very well be the last time we here OMAHApretty crazy  
 FINAL THOUGHTS  PICK  
I may sound contrarian but I dont understand why everyone thinks its a given the Panthers are going to steamroll the Broncos  The blueprint to beat the Panthers was laid out when the Falcons took them down in week 16 Their defense slow down Cam by stopping the inside run with their front 7 taking away the deep passing game with Trufant on Ginn and committing the rest of their resources to Greg Olsen  Their offense moved the ball by sticking with the run converting manageable 3rd down situations and taking care of the football 1 turnoversound familiar This is exactly what I think the Broncos will attempt to do even without the Falcons game on tape and the matchup analysis suggests they can execute this game plan even better especially on defense where they have the makeup to potentially clamp down on the entire attack  This isnt to say the Panthers wont score  they wont get shut out because their own defense will leave them in favorable field position more often than not  but theres no guarantee they even win let alone cover a 6 point spread Bovada 
 Speaking of the spread this line is out of control  Pinnacle opened with the Panthers as 35point favorites during half time of the Cardinals game and since then its done nothing but rise as the public has been pounding the Panthers  I get where theyre coming from The Panthers crushed both the Seahawks and the Cardinals and Peyton is falling apart so how could they possibly lose Well the Seahawks game should not have been surprising given the dubious scheduling position the Hawks were in while Palmer inexplicably transformed into Brian Hoyer  Handicapping is so much more than just 2 games and theres a reason why Pinnacle opened at 35 which even then was a tad bit higher than our Models projection of 34 taking into account neutral field 
 Speaking of the Models projection winning by 34 obviously opens up a couple points of line value with the Broncos  While a couple pts doesnt seem like much on the surface it is significant according to our Model which is why it is recommending a 2 unit wager on the Broncos  I happen to like them just a bit more  Im a huge proponent of the Defense wins championships mantra and Ive been saying all year that the Broncos are a bet on team as underdogs or short favorites so Im not going to stop now just because its the Super Bowl  
 Broncos 6 is a 4 unit wager for me  Broncos 7 wont happen and theres no reason to wait for 65 since we would only be gaining the hook  Losing the 6 and getting 55 or less on the other hand is much worse so Ill lock in the 6 105 now which again is available at Bovada  I hope I peeled the onion back enough for you to see why the Broncos have a solid chance at not just covering the spread but winning the game as well  Good luck on whatever you choose and enjoy the game and the end of the season  
  PROP BETS  Prop bets for me anyways are for fun and theres certainly no shortage of prop bets in the Super Bowl Bovada claims to have 500 up right now  Heres 10 that Ive picked out  I might add a couple more on the weekend so check back or follow me on twitter bbsportsguru for updates 
 1 Team to score first wins the game  No 135 Bovada  I love this prop for 2 reasons For starters scoring first definitely does not guarantee a win especially in a defensive battle  More importantly though it gives us Moneyline odds of 135 on whichever team does not score first  If the Broncos score first we get the Panthers ML at 135 which is far better than the odds available right now  If the Panthers score first we lose a bit of value on the Broncos since you can get them for more than that on the Moneyline right now but the dropoff is not significant by any means 
 2 CJ Anderson Over 565 rush yds 125 Bet365 As I mentioned in my writeup I think CJ Anderson should have a good game  The Panthers run defense is a bit overrated so were getting some value here Besides hes had over 70 rush yds in each of his last 4 games 3 of which were against very good run defenses Steelers Bengals Patriots 
 3 Broncos FGs Made  Over 15 100 Bet365 Im pretty surprised were getting odds with this  McManus isnt a bad kicker and hes had multiFG games every game since Peyton took over including 7 in the playoffs 
 4 Cam Newton to score a TD anytime 111 Bet365 You almost have to bet this 
 5 Most Time of Possession  Broncos 100 Bet365 Looking at previous stats shows that the Panthers average 36 mins of possession in the postseason which is better than the Broncos 31 and the reason why the Broncos are dogs in this prop  However since Im projecting the Broncos to come out with a similar plan as the Falcons in week 16 I think they slow this game down and win the TOP battle Falcons won that battle 36 mins  24 mins 
  6  7 Panthers win by 712 400 Broncos win by 16 475 Bet365  Bovada Since Im projecting a close game and think the Broncos can win the latter choice is a no brainer and would add to my winnings of Broncos 6  That said if the Panthers manage to just cover the spread the former play would help win back some of the losses  For that reason Im going to put a little extra on the former vs the latter 
 8 Total Band  3140 pts 275 Bet365  Bovada My analysis suggests a low scoring game  I thought about simply playing the under for 1 unit but 45 isnt all that high to begin with This is a small play for me 
 9 Peyton Manning to score a TD anytime 1600 Bet365 Why not This is the Super Bowl a time when you reach deep into the playbook and call things that were never called before  How about a playaction naked bootleg from 5 yds out Nobody would expect that 
  10 Super Bowl MVP  Von Miller 2200 Bet365 Obviously the popular MVP bets are going to be the QBs  If the Panthers win Cam will almost certainly get the honors more on this in a second but if the Broncos win it should be because of their defense  That opens up a lot of value on a flier like Von Miller who will need to have a big game in order for the Broncos to win anyways  Interestingly Cam as MVP is 168 which is better odds than Carolina ML  Theres a chance that someone like Luke Kuechly could get it but 99 times out of a 100 it would be Cam if the Panthers win so you might be better off picking that than the Panthers ML  Im not but thought Id share that option with you
