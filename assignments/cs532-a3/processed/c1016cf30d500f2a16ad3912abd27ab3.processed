The Super Bowl is well known for thenbspnumerous prop bets one can wager on A prop bet takes individual events within or connected to the game and allows you to bet on them They can be connected to the onfield action meaning you can bet on things like total passing yards for Cam Newton or Peyton Manning total receiving yards for Demaryius Thomas or Ted Ginn Jr or total rushing yards for CJ Anderson or Jonathan Stewart However for the Super Bowl prop bets will also benbspincredibly random You can bet on things like how long the national anthem will last how many times dab or dabbing will be said by announcers or even whether the coin toss will come up heads or tails
Thenbspfirst official prop bet was whether Chicago Bears defensive lineman William Refrigerator Perry would score a touchdown in Super Bowl XX The onfield prop bets dont change much from yeartoyear aside from the occasional player addition However the offfield entertainment prop bets can get particularly crazy This year Peyton Mannings potential retirement is prominent Additionally a year removed from Left Sharks notable performance in Katy Perrys halftime show you can bet on whether he will make a guest appearance during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show
