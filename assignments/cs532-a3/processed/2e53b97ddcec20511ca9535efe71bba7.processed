                With Super Bowl 50 now just days away its becoming clearer which studios and which of their films will air TV commercials during Sundays championship football game According to AdAge Disney has secured as many as four ingame ads a tally that does not include subsidiary Marvels crossover promo with CocaCola The outlet reports that in addition to The Jungle Book and Alice Through the Looking Glass Captain America Civil War is also expected to air a TV spot Might this be when we finally get a look at the MCUs new SpiderMan While Disney has not confirmed Caps presence in the Big Game reports AdAge a buy is all but inevitable given how predecessor Captain America The Winter Soldier fared at the box office after its Super Bowl ad dropped in 2014 AdAge speculates that the fourth Disney Super Bowl spot could go to Zootopia Finding Dory or The BFG In any case Disney will not air any TV spots after the third quarter

 Universal has one Super Bowl spot set which is expected to be for Bourne 5 Paramount will air a spot for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows As for 20th Century Fox we already knew they were planning for their upcoming XMen Apocalypse and Deadpool to have a presence in San Francisco where the Super Bowl will be played this weekend but AdAge reports that the studio only has two 30second spots running during the game  and one of them is for Eddie the Eagle see the spot below

 The smart money as AdAge puts it is on Independence Day Resurgence since its predecessor made such a splash with its Super Bowl spot twenty years ago Warner Bros and Sony Pictures are skipping the Super Bowl this year We will be posting all the movie Super Bowl spots as we get them Sunday so keep it locked on IGN
