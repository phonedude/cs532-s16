		SAN JOSE CalifnbspnbspThe father had so much on his mind as he worked his waynbspup the New Jersey Turnpike that day in 2001 His daughter still just a toddler had a rare blood disease with littlenbsphope for a cure His son an active fourthgrade boy was driving with him to Hackensack University Medical Centernbsppreparing to donate his bone marrow to save her
Scott Simonson was alternately dealing with his worst fears and his greatest hopes as a father when the boy in the passenger seat asked him a question
Who is going to get my room
The father was confused He asked what the boy meant
Im going to die Who is going to get my stuff
Simonson pulled the car to the side of the Turnpike in disbelief He realized his son Scott Jr thought he was giving up his own life to save his 3yearold sister Shannon that day But it was the next realization that made him fight back tears 15 years later
The boy didnt care
MORE Who are the 50 greatest NFL players from New Jerseynbsp
There is nothing my son can do on the football fieldnbsp EVER  will compare to what he has done already for this family the father said from Red Bank this week This weekend could be God giving my son a high five for what he did for everything that happened
Because this weekend is and against long odds on an athletic levelnbsp well get to that part of this Jersey underdog story soon enough  Scott Simonson will take the field as a special teams player and a thirdstring tight end for the favored Carolina Panthersnbsp

He certainly wont attract much attention He wont in fact even be the most famous Carolina tight end from New Jersey not with Wayne Hills star Greg Olsen on his teamnbsp
But the Red Bank native who played for powerhouse Middletown South will be there at Levis Stadium and so will a family that includes the sick little girl he helped save Shannon is now a high school junior who just got her drivers licensenbspwith no signs of the disease that might have killed her
The father considers himself the luckiest man on earth Oh yeah and he also gets to watch his son in the Super Bowl on Sunday
A scary diagnosisnbsp
The Simonsons knew something wasnt right They were at the doctors office for what was supposed to be a routine physical for their youngest daughter Shannon who had just turned 1 But the doctor kept redoing the blood testnbsp
Then came the diagnosis Shannon had an extremely rare genetic conditionnbspcalled Fanconi Anemia There were only 1800 known cases in the world and for most the outcome was grim Many patients with the blood disorder would not live to adulthoodnbsp
The family was devastated Soon however they would discover a series of breaks that Scott Simonson Sr said were about as likely as winning the Lotto every year of my life
First the leading doctor for Fanconi Anemia was right in New Jersey Alfred Gillio a pediatric hematologistoncologist in Hackensack Gillio had begun working with a new drug to treat the condition one that his patients could receive without the devastating affects of radiation treatment on their young bodiesnbsp
PLUS New Jersey legend Sam Mills Jr still inspires the Panthersnbsp
But they needed a bone marrow donor Simonson Sr remembers the look of amazement on the doctors face when he delivered the news Not only was his son a perfect match but so was the familys oldest daughter Kelsey
They were very lucky Gillio said from his office and there was never really any doubt Scott Jr or Scotty as the family called him would be the donor Being the typical big brother he said I was all for it

His father was amazed that as they waited the year and a half for Shannons body to develop to give the treatment a better chance his son never expressed concern or fear A school psychologist said he was more like a Navy SEAL than a grade school boy focused on the mission
Finally when the surgery arrived the doctors drilled into two spots in his lower back to remove the marrow He went home that night Shannon was supposed to be in the hospital for 30 to 60 days the procedure was such a success she left in exactly 28 and hasnt looked back
She doesnt remember much about that time in her life I found a letter in my room that he wrote me when I was in the hospital a few years later she said in a phone interview from her home How he was hoping that Id get better All of his classmates wrote cards too
She is not cured She still needs regular checkups because people with Fanconi Anemia have a higher rate of cancer occurrences at a young age especially in the head and neck Still given where this started her mother Jeanne Simonson said I have to pinch myself all the time and say How the heck did we get here
She laughed over the phone and credits Scottys superstar NFL bone marrow for saving her daughter But even that part the NFL journey was a ride that few saw coming nbsp
Division 2 to the Super Bowlnbsp
ScottnbspSimonson Jr played at Middletown South a powerhouse that has produced several NFL players including one Knowshon Moreno who played in a Super Bowl But the lifelong Giants fan who attended dozens of games with his father growing upnbspwas hardly a starnbsp
After battling injuries and illness he didnt get much playing time as a receiver until his senior year and by then the Division 1 college scouts had looked elsewhere So Simonson took his best offer at tiny Assumption College a liberal arts school in Worcester Mass that only produced one NFL player in its history and that was a placekicker for a single gamenbsp
It didnt take long for the coaches at the Division 2 school to know that they had struck recruiting gold Simonson had grown into a 6foot5 250pound tight end with great hands a talent that was virtually unheard of at that levelnbsp
I didnt really know the NFL was possible until junior year of college when I started having scouts from teams showing up he said I kind of thought Maybe I could do something with this

A big break came when with the help of Rutgers legend Marco Battaglia Simonson earned an invitation to Rutgers pro day The Broncos had interest So did the Chargers and Raiders He signed with the Raidersnbspas an undrafted free agent and while he became a valuable special teams player and saw some action at tight end he was cut in Junenbsp
Thats when he received an unexpected call The Panthers wanted him to come to Charlotte NC for a workout He impressed them enough to earn a spot at training camp then on the practice squad and then on the active roster midway through the season
He had no idea he was boarding a highspeed train to a shot at NFL history Thats just how it works sometimes A player might spend 15 years as a pro without a shot at a championship but Simonson gets one in his second yearnbsp
Wow he said during the mayhem that is Super Bowl Opening Night Im just very fortunate very happy with the opportunity and where my football career has gone There have be some ups and downs but this really would be somethingnbsp
Is it karma for what he did as a boy 15 years ago His father has no idea He just knows that no matter what happens in Super Bowl 50 or beyond his son is already the MVP of his familynbsp
