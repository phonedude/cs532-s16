scrutiny after the Paris attacks CNNHillary Clinton is calling for more allied planes more airstrikes and a broader target set  though no largescale mobilization of US ground troops  to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria She urged Congress to approve a new authorization of the use of military force against ISIS saying that doing so would signal that the US is committed to this fight The time for delay is over We should get this doneIn the wake of the Paris attacks for which ISIS has claimed responsibility Clinton said that every society faces a choice between fear and resolve  an indirect shot at her Republican foes in the 2016 presidential race who have called for the United States to shut out Syrian refugees This is no time to be scoring political points We must use every pillar of American power including our values to fight terror Clinton saidShe said airstrikes by an international antiISIS coalition will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS the former secretary of state said Thursday in a speech in New York City Read MoreClinton called for more flexibility for US Special Operations forces and trainers to work with regional forces  particularly Sunnis and Kurds  in opposing ISIS She said she is open to sending more than the 50 of those forces that President Barack Obama has already mobilized But Clinton said she opposes a new US ground war in the Middle East That is just not the smart move here she said RELATED Hillary Clintons record at State Department Blessing or curseBut Clinton did not detail her plans if regional powers fail to supply more troops and arms for the fight and left herself leeway on how many American troops she would support sendingInstead Clinton sought to ramp up pressure on Iraqs Shialed government and on Turkey to set aside old grievances saying that the threat from ISIS cannot wait She said Qatar and Saudi Arabia need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations And she acknowledged that the US desire to see the ouster of Syrian President Bashar alAssad who she said has slaughtered more Syrians than terrorists have isnt a top priorityWe need people to turn against the common enemy of ISIS Clinton saidIn a shot at Republicans who have criticized her for not using the phrase Clinton said that denouncing radical Islamic terrorism amounts to giving these criminals these murderers more standing than they deserve Our priority should be how to fight the enemy Clinton said during a speech attended by many of her top aides an indication of how important they considered the remarks In the end it didnt matter what kind of terrorist we called bin Laden it mattered that we killed bin LadenClinton in a major break from her GOP presidential rivals called for the United States to continue accepting Syrian refugees despite reports that at least one of the Paris attackers entered Europe under that guise Turning away orphans applying a religious test discriminating against Muslims slamming the door on every Syrian refugee  that is just not who we are Clinton said She added It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones RELATED Hillary Clinton fails to capitalize on her resume at Democratic debateAides were working on the speech which Clinton was said to have a substantial hand in until hours before she delivered it Clinton delivered the speech at the Council on Foreign Relations Pratt House an ornate mansion on New Yorks Upper Eastside New York Mayor Bill De Blasio who just recently endorsed Clintons candidacy sat in the front row joined by Vernon Jordan a longtime adviser to the Clintons and Richard Haass the president of the Council on Foreign Relations Thomas Nides Clintons deputy Secretary of State was also seated in the front rowClinton using a teleprompter also called for stronger intelligencegathering capabilities  saying US tech companies have a role to play We need Silicon Valley not to view government as its adversary she said calling for solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy Clinton also made the case for US leadership saying  in a shot at Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders her Democratic primary opponent who has placed major emphasis on the need for coalitions to fight ISIS  that there has been lot of talk about coalitions Everybody wants oneAfter the Paris attacks tilted the presidential race toward foreign policy Clinton is attempting to escape the shadows of her hawkish history and her ties to President Barack Obamas legacyForeign policy is an area Clinton who spent four years as Obamas secretary of state and was involved in nearly all of his administrations key decisions during that tenure counted as a strength at the campaigns outset But even as she has embraced Obamas domestic policy achievements  a popular move in the Democratic nominating contest  his foreign policy record has become more complicated to address Clintons primary rivals Sanders and former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley repeatedly latched Clinton to Obama when Democrats held their second debate Saturday Republicans too are connecting Clinton to Obama  with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus saying her speech Thursday was largely a repeat of Obamas existing plansHillary Clinton is the architect of the failed Obama foreign policy that has presided over a steep increase in radical Islamic terrorism and the rise of ISIS Rather than putting forward a new plan to defeat ISIS Hillary Clinton offered soaring platitudes and largely doubled down on the existing Obama strategyRELATED GOP looks to seize national security advantage from Obama over ISISClinton praised Obama in February saying that a lot of the right moves are being made And in June of 2015 Clinton said she would have advised him to do exactly as I believe he is now doing Clinton has highlighted some of her differences with Obama in recent days casting herself as a hawkish member of Obamas cabinet She pushed for the United States to join a coalition to oust Libyas strongman Moammar Gadhafi And Clinton pointed Saturday to her calls to train and equip moderate rebels in Syria very early onShe underscored that position again ThursdayI have made clear that we have differences as I think any two people do Clinton said adding that she and Obama largely agreed during her time as Americas top diplomatBut even as I was still there which is publicly known I thought we needed to do more earlier to help local Syrian fighters against leader Bashar alAssadClinton was asked by CNNs Fareed Zakaria who moderated a postspeech discussion whether Obama erred in once referring to ISIS as the JV team  but she deflected I dont think its useful to go back and replow old ground she said Clinton criticized Republican Sen Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov Jeb Bush two GOP 2016 hopefuls who have said the United States should focus on helping Syrian Christians first I just dont think we should have religious test about who we bring as refugees into our country she saidAlready Clinton had split with Obama by calling for the institution and enforcement of a nofly zone over Syria designed in part to offer safe harbor for refugees fleeing the countrys civil war and ISIS  a move that would require greater military involvement And she made news Saturday by saying that ISIS cannot be contained it must be defeatedFurther complicating Clintons task is the original foreign policy wedge between her and Obama Iraq ThenNew York senator Clinton in 2002 supported George W Bushs push for war That vote  which she has since repeatedly called a mistake  was key to helping Obama surpass Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary Now Clintons chief intraparty rival for the 2016 nomination Sanders is again using her Iraq vote against her  blaming that war for creating a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of ISIS I dont think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now Sanders said Saturday during the Democratic debate in Iowa RELATED Poll shows Americans oppose Syrian refugees in USClinton must also keep one eye on the general election  and Republicans who are advocating a much more aggressive US role in fighting ISIS Jeb Bush called Wednesday in a speech at The Citadel a military academy in South Carolina for American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria The Paris terrorist attacks have in recent days dominated the 2016 cycle and Clinton has used many of her events since then to comment on how she would handle the response Thursdays speech is an attempt to set her record out in one place at one time Clinton has advocated for accepting refugees fleeing Syria over the last few days but stressed that  unlike her Republican foes in the 2016 race  she would not commit ground troops to the fightWe need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like ISIS the barbaric ruthless violence jihadist terrorist group Clinton said at the second Democratic presidential debate earlier this month But she said the United States should support those who take the fight to ISIS rather than fighting the group aloneThis cannot be an American fight although American leadership is essential she saidThe former secretary of state cautiously supported Obama last month when he decided to authorize the use of special forces in Syria Her spokesman Nick Merrill said that the candidate sees merit in deploying the 50 special operations forcesClinton has also called for the United States to continue to take in refugees from Syria something a host of Republican governors and presidential candidates have said they would not doWe cant act as though we are shutting the door
