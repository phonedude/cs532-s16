On most nights when Margy Agar finally falls asleep shes curled up with her daughters blanket She wears her daughters gym clothes as pajamas and her Army dog tags as a necklaceSometimes when Margy wakes up she has dreamt of her daughters death She thanks God it was only a dreamThen she remembersWar can destroy some of the nations most promising young people  and not always on the battlefield Sgt Kim Agar was a Texas beauty queen a talented singer and a soldier who was awarded several medals But she also was a 25yearold woman who struggled with a traumatic brain injury which can have lingering and even deadly effects with little outward signs of traumaHer experience in the war seemed to exacerbate emotional issues shed had since adolescence She hid her suffering from those closest to her until last October when she took her own lifeMilitary suicide has soared since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan In 2011 Kim was one of about 300 military suicides according to the Department of Defense The Pentagon has made suicide prevention a top priority but so far has struggled to curb the problemMany families are left not only mourning but also seeking to understand how and why their loved ones died Margy 57 has spent the last year consumed by her daughters deathAt her Bedford apartment Margy keeps Kims pageant crowns on a corner table in the living room Her formal Army dress blues hang on the door to her brothers room Margy has plastered a large photo of her and her daughter on the divider to the kitchenBut among the photos scrapbooks and Army artifacts there is another object in Kimis Corner of the apartment a thick white binder containing hundreds of pages marked with yellow highlighterWhen Margy looks at that binder other feelings stir beneath the sorrow Anger Frustration ConfusionHer need for answers awakens a strength she didnt know she hadCrowns for helmetsThroughout her childhood Kim sang anywhere she could  from nursing homes and malls to Rangers Ballpark and the White House Her voice also opened the door for her to compete in beauty pageantsIn high school Kim won Miss Teen Burleson Miss Teen Parker County and Miss Teen Northeast Tarrant County She placed 17th in the Miss Teen Texas competitionRebecca Robinson who won Miss Texas in 2008 said Kims sincerity set her apart from other girls in the pageant system She always had an open heart Very very sweet Robinson said There was never a moment when she was not supportiveBut during that period Kims parents split up which Margy said affected Kim for years afterward At 16 Kim slit her wrists in front of her mother because of the divorce Margy said Army records indicate Kim overdosed on drugs and alcohol at 17 but Margy said she wasnt aware of thisKim went to Birdville High School where she received a letter jacket for community service After graduating in 2004 Kim attended community college But Kim had attention deficit disorder and dyslexia and Margy said college didnt work out for her She worked as a waitress and a lifeguard At 20 she was charged with a DWI but the charges were dropped according to the ArmyWhen her older brother Stephen joined the Air Force Kim was inspired In 2006 she surprised her family and friends and enlisted in the Army She was stationed with the 104th Transportation Co at Fort Benning in GeorgiaIED attackIn the summer of 2007 Kim was deployed to Iraq She drove equipment across the country Just a few months into combat an improvised explosive device or IED hit Kims truckMargy was told a large mushroom cloud of dust surrounded the truck The blast broke the trucks windshield Insurgents fired at Kim and the driver who did the only thing they could They kept driving through the ambushAfter the attack Kim was diagnosed with a concussion hearing loss and insomnia according to Margy and Army records They were very lucky they didnt die Margy said But I look back and think it was a slow deathWhile Kim was overseas Margy lived for short middleofthenight phone calls The pair also chatted on Facebook Margy knew her daughter was in a military mood when she called her Mom and a girly mood when she called her Mama She knew shed made her daughter laugh when Kim called her a dorkBut Margy didnt know that her daughter was struggling and didnt find out about her daughters injuries until Kim returned from Iraq in the fall of 2008 I felt like if she wanted to say anything about the war she would say it she said I didnt want to ask herDream to nightmareBy 2011 Kim was deployed to Germany There she decided to audition for the US Army Europe Band amp Chorus On the final night of a 30day audition Margy paced around her apartment at 3 am When Kim called to say she had made it they both screamed for joy Kim danced around her room Margy cried happy tearsAs part of the chorus Kim traveled across Europe She sang for dignitaries like the British royal family Kim said she was living her dreamBut she was also dealing with lingering effects from the IED attack She suffered from headaches that nauseated her Her ears rang constantly Her high school years became a blur She told her mom she felt like she was losing her mindMargy urged her to see a doctor In May 2011 Kim was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury a signature wound of the Iraq and Afghanistan warsMargy says the brain injury affected Kims ability to hear music and sing on key Margy believes some members of the chorus made fun of Kim because of it  she even uses the term bullying Army records indicate that Kim had a conflict with a colleagueSomewhere along the way Margy said her dream turned into a nightmareThe knock on the doorOnce Kim had left the combat zone Margy thought she had been saved from something she feared the most  hearing the knock on the doorBut for several years Kim had been battling mental health issues including depression and adjustment disorder an extreme or excessive response to a particular eventIn Iraq Kim had cut herself to help deal with the stress of combat At the time Kim explained that she used drugs and alcohol and cut herself as coping mechanisms according to Army recordsBut after she left Iraq Kim no longer reported depression or anxiety according to the Army As late as July 2011 her records showed no symptoms Then in August 2011 while still living in Germany Kim slipped into a particularly difficult bout with depressionOn Sept 6 2011 a member of the chorus criticized Kims singing Kim had previously used criticism as motivation for improvement but this time she feared she would be removed from the chorus Army records state Kim texted a friend saying I screwed up today That night Kim was found in her room with cuts on her arm towels on the floor and sad music playing She was taken to the hospital to recoverAbout a week later Kim was released with orders to attend therapy Her Army supervisors put her on a 48hour suicide watch and she was not left alone during that time Army records state When she returned to the chorus Kim asked to be moved into a new room in her barracks where Margy says she did not have a roommate and was on an isolated floorFor the next two weeks band members and leaders checked on Kim regularly Kim also went to counseling The Army says she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder marked by unstable selfimage and relationships impulsivity and suicidal behavior Margy believes a more accurate diagnosis would have been posttraumatic stress disorderIts unclear whether Kim was supposed to be on a 247 suicide watch during this period in late September Based on a criminal investigation report on Kims death Margy believes that Kims doctor recommended a continuous watch because he feared she might relapseBut in an interview last week a US Army Europe spokesman said Kim was under no suicide watch beyond the initial 48 hoursOther Army records make a reference to allegations that a caseworker took Kim off suicide watch without her doctors consent The caseworker retired immediately after Kims death and the investigator could not find her to interview her But based on other interviews the investigator concluded that she had not violated medical orders the Army spokesman saidBy the last weekend of September 2011 Kim was no longer on a suicide watch and her colleagues were no longer checking on her regularlyOn Friday Sept 30 the female soldiers in the chorus got into an argument about one of their colleagues who was not there at the time A sergeant decided to resolve it after the weekend On Monday Oct 3 Kim did not report for formation or show up to her scheduled therapy appointment She was found dead in her roomThat same day thousands of miles away in the United States Margy was at a friends house when her son Chris called her to say there were two soldiers at their door Once on the road she called Chris back He told her one of the soldiers was wearing a chaplains collar In hysterics she pulled over Police drove her homeHer exhusband and two sons were waiting for her The soldiers took the parents upstairs and broke the news I just knew Margy said I knew what the first words were On behalf  Five days later on Chris 21st birthday Kim came home in a flagdraped casketSitting on her couch Margy pores over the thick white binder that contains the Armys investigation into Kims death Her short gray hair is curled She wears a pin for Gold Star Moms mothers who have lost a child in the militaryMargy used to be a teacher and later handled claims in personal auto insurance Now she suffers from depression and posttraumatic stress disorder She lives on disability payments for her depression as well as problems with her knees back and neckShe tucks her knees into her chest and wraps her arms close to her Small and fragile she cannot talk about Kim for long without cryingShes still learning how to talk about Kims deathTo say My daughter died from suicide is hard because of the stigma Margy said Its hard for me Its hard for any member of my family to say how she diedBut Margy is also drawing strength from her pain and becoming an advocate for military familiesOnce my children became soldiers she said all soldiers became my childrenShe wants to combat the stigma of suicide and support other families left behind She hopes raising awareness about military suicide will be Kims legacyMilitary suicides nearly doubled from 2001 to 2011 The average number of suicides has been 300 per year since 2009 That spike can be attributed almost entirely to a soaring suicide rate in the Army which is the largest service branch In 2001 Army suicides made up about a third of the militarys total By 2011 they made up more than half Rates in other branches have remained relatively stable or even decreased since the beginning of the wars according to Department of Defense statisticsAnd traumatic brain injury diagnoses have increased threefold since the beginning of the wars People with traumatic brain injuries are 15 times more likely than healthy people to die from suicide according to a report by the Center for a New American Security an independent nonprofit that develops national security and defense policiesA spokeswoman from the Department of Defense said the Pentagon increased behavioral health care providers by 35 percent over the past three years and undertook the largest study of mental health risk conducted by military personnel It has also worked to improve early detection of traumatic brain injuries but it has struggled to find an effective treatment for mild cases which often go undetectedBut some like Margy wonder whether the military is doing enough to help its soldiers She has questions Lots of questions And she asks them to anyone in the military who will listenWhy did the Army allow Kim to move to a single room after her Sept 6 suicide attempt Why didnt the Army notify Margy of that attempt Why was Kim allegedly taken off suicide watch Why didnt the Army medically discharge her What happened on that Friday to make Kim dread going to work on MondayMost people when theyre laid in the ground everything is laid to rest Margy said When she was laid to the ground everything blew upThe US Army Europe spokesman said the investigating officer found that while Kims death was aggravated by her military service the band exercised due diligence in caring for her after her Sept 6 suicide attempt The Dallas Morning News request for interviews with senior leaders in the US Army Europe Band amp Chorus was deniedMargy believes the Army could have done more to prevent Kims death Sometimes she also questions her culpability My heart is telling me I didnt protect her she saidChanneling her griefIn Kimis Corner of the apartment Margy looks at the Purple Heart and sees everything her daughter accomplished She feels proudBut the medal also represents all Margy has done to honor Kim in the last year Margy worked to reinstate Kims combat action badge which she says was revoked because of paperwork thrown away She raised money to create a Miss Texas community service award in Kims nameShe also made sure Kim was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart for her injuries from the IED attack Just last year the Department of Defense clarified that brain injuries must be caused in combat and severe enough to require medical treatment to be eligible for the awardOn July 4 when the Purple Heart was presented at the Miss Texas pageant in Allen Margy had achieved everything she had promised KimMargy walked on stage with Kims father She wore a plastic button with photos of Kim pinned to her floorlength gown The crowd gave the parents a standing ovationA sergeant presented them with the medal as well as a Purple Heart pin
