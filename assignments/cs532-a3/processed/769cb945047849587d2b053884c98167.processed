					The things we said about Cam Newton five years ago
					Posted by 	Brad Gagnon

					Cam Newton is about to be named MVP and is a strong favorite to earn the same award in Super Bowl 50 But not long ago a lot of folks were doubting the uniquelytalented quarterback

Just a small collection of things said about Newton leading up to the 2011 NFL draft8230
8220I just don8217t know if he cares enough8221 8212 NFL Network8217s Mike Mayock
Appearing on The Dan Patrick Show days before the draft Mayock voiced some strong concerns about the Auburn product stating8220It8217s just this gut feeling I have that I don8217t know how great he wants to be8221
More from USA Today
8220What it really comes down to 8230 is football IQ and work ethic And if he wants to be the best quarterback in the game I8217m all in I love it
8220But something tells me that he8217ll be content to be a multimillionaire who8217s pretty good And that doesn8217t get it done for me8221
8220Does not command respect from teammates and will always struggle to win a locker room8221 8212 Pro Football Weekly8217sNolan Nawrocki
It gets worse via PFT
8220Very disingenuous  has a fake smile comes off as very scripted and has a selfish mefirst makeup Always knows where the cameras are and plays to them Has an enormous ego with a sense of entitlement that continually invites trouble and makes him believe he is above the law  does not command respect from teammates and will always struggle to win a locker room    Lacks accountability focus and trustworthiness  is not punctual seeks shortcuts and sets a bad example Immature and has had issues with authority Not dependable8221
8220He would scare me to death to take8221 8212 Unnamed scout
That comes from a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that produced some serious hindsight gold including
Newton the driving force behind Auburn8217s national championship isn8217t even the toprated quarterback in the draft based on the consensus of scouts
That would be Missouri8217s Blaine Gabbert another strapping underclassmen who like Newton also ran the spreadoption offense that isn8217t conducive to the prostyle approach of the NFL
And
I don8217t like any of them really8221 said a national scout for a team with an established starter 8220There8217s no Sam Bradfords There8217s no Josh Freeman I think they8217re all second or third rounders8221
And
The scouts also were asked a multiplechoice question on how Newton8217s career would play out
Two said Newton would be a perennial Pro Bowler nine said he8217d be a solid starter nine said he8217d play but never be effective and four said he8217d be a bust
8220Looks terrible8221 8212 Unnamed scout
That was based on Newton8217s highlycriticized Scouting Combine performance
8220Give the Panthers a quarterback who can complete 60percent of his passes and give them some semblance of a passing game and theyll be competitiveNewtons not going to do that right away and maybe he never does8221 8212 ESPN8217sPat Yasinskas
Although toYasinskas8217 credit he adjusted his position on Newton prior to the draft stating
New Orleans has Drew Brees and Atlanta has Matt Ryan You do the math but my quick calculations say three out of four NFC South teams have a franchise quarterback who will be around for the foreseeable future
Thats why the Panthers need to take Newton He is the only guy in this years draft with a chance to be a true franchise quarterback The No 1 pick is a gift designed to help the leagues worst team get better and at least in theory you have to take your shot when its there because you shouldn8217t be sitting at No 1 repeatedly
8220In no way am I saying that I have convictions in either of these two quarterbacks as I see both as potential boom or bust guys and I do not think either is worth the risk pulling the trigger on in the first round8221 8212 Wes Bunting of the National Football Post referring to Newton and Jake Locker
In regard to Newton8217s maturity
One scout told me that he comes off as a mature and wellspoken kid in the media but its all an act In reality he said that hes a selfish me first guy who eventually would have worn out his welcome at Auburn
8220What worries me about Cam Newton is is he a person who is going to work hard Will he be dedicated Is the money going to spoil him Will he take coaching What kind of a leader will he be8221 8212 NFL Network8217s Mike Lombardi
Same thing different place
8220If Mike Holmgren takes Cam Newton he better be fired I don8217t care who he is you would severely damage this process we have going here8221 8212 Clevelandcom reader
Yeah thank goodness the Browns stuck to their process and traded down before taking Baylor defensive tackle Phil Taylor8230
8220He was a oneyear wonder Akili Smith was a oneyear wonder8221 8212 ESPN8217sMel Kiper Jr
The comparison alone had to hurt
We know he loves to play the game of football but this isn8217t the NBA8221 8212 Kiper
No I swear to god That8217s an actual quote per PFT
Things came easy to Cam Newton at Auburn8221 he added 8220I hope he doesnt think theyll come easy in the NFL8221
8220I see myself not only as a football player but an entertainer and an icon8221 8212 Cam Newton
That didn8217t help his cause
8220A lot of criticism he8217s receiving is unfortunate and racially biased8221 8212 Warren Moon
The more things change8230
