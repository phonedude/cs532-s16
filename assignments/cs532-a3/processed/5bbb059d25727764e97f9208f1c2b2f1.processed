                Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton criticizes Sen Bernie Sanders on gun control Reuters
              
            
          
             
                  
     
              
      
        
      

      
        Hillary Clinton used the gun debate to try and attack Sen Bernie Sanders from the left at the first Democratic debate

Sandersrsquo record on the issue has been the subject of much liberal ire After CNN moderator Anderson Cooper grilled Sanders on his vote shielding firearms companies from lawsuits Clinton brought up another time Sanders didnrsquot side with gun control advocates

quotThe majority of our country supports background and even the majority of gun owners doquot Clinton said on Oct 13 quotSen Sanders did vote five times against the Brady Billquot

Clinton is correct that most Americans 90 percent support background checks But did Sanders vote against the landmark Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act which mandated a fiveday waiting period for background checks for gun purchases

Five nays from the Vermont congressman

The Clinton campaign pointed to our July factcheck of an attack ad paid for by a proMartin OrsquoMalley super PAC We rated a slightly more expansive claim mdash quotBernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill background checks and waiting periodsquot mdash Mostly True That statement that referred specifically to background checks which Sanders had supported

Before it became law in 1993 the Brady bill underwent many transformations Sanders then Vermontrsquos sole representative in the US House of Representatives voted against the bill in its entirety five times

1 In May 1991 Sanders voted against a version that mandated a sevenday waiting period for background checks but the bill passed in the House nbsp

2 The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House In November 1991 Sanders voted against that version Though it passed in the House the Senate didnrsquot muster enough votes The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992

3 After some back and forth a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the fiveday waiting period In November 1993 Sanders voted against that version twice in the same day but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead seen by some as pointless as the technology for instant checks didnrsquot exist at the time

4 He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why

5 The final compromise version of the Brady bill  nbspan interim fiveday waiting period while installing an instant background check system  was passed and signed into law on Nov 30 1993 Sanders voted against it

In July when we first looked into the issue Sandersrsquo campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents

quotHe wasn39t opposed to states having waiting periods if they wanted to The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them and Bernie voted that downquot Weaver said quotHe said he would be against waiting periods and he kept his word to the people of Vermontquot

A mixed record overall

Overall Sanders is neither a gun nut nor an antigunner Hersquos received lukewarm marks from the NRA ranging from a C to F in the last 15 years

quotThroughout his time in public office Sen Sanders has consistently voted to outlaw the most dangerous weapons and keep guns out of the hands of criminalsquot Sanders spokesperson Michael Briggs told us

Briggs noted that Sanders has voted in favor of banning assault weapons closing the gun show loophole regulating high capacity magazines and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown massacre

On the flip side Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains and in National Parks though his most recent progun vote was in 2009

quotSandersrsquo gun control position is a reflection of living in Vermont for 40 yearsquot Garrison Nelson a professor of professor of political science at the University of Vermont told us in July quotVermonters use guns to shoot deer and moose not one anotherquot

Our ruling

Clinton said quotSen Sanders did vote five times against the Brady billquot

Sanders voted against the Brady bill five times from 1991 to 1993 Sandersrsquo campaign manager told us in July that he did so because he was against a national waiting period and had to answer to the people of Vermont a rural state with high gun ownership

Overall Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to guns But he did indeed register five nays on the Brady bill

We rate Clintonrsquos claim True
