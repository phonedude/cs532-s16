				Super Bowl 50 Preview
					
				
				
					By Kevin Cunningham Managing Editor of Internet Content
Let me start out by saying that Im a Tennessee Titans fan who respects Peyton Manning Year in and year out he would crush my Titans but how could I hate on the guy I couldnt
I like what seems to be most of the country at this point are in favor of Peyton going out a winner Especially considering the former Volunteer is going against the top villain in the world Cam Newton
Im under this thought of the future MVP He played the Titans in Tennessee earlier this season and he was crushing my favorite team He was celebrating Dabbing Supermaning you name it It was too much
But you know what If hes succeeding at the highest level and hes celebrating so be it Plenty of football players do Aaron Rodgers JJ Watt Antonio Brown  they all celebrate Cam just does it too much To stop him from celebrating just beat him He wont celebrate after a loss I guarantee it
Would I like a Tennessee Titan showboating across the field after every first down Absolutely not But if you want it to stop just stop the man His celebrating isnt the most outrageous thing in the world to me Call me crazy
Carolina Panthers vs Denver Broncos
Finally getting into the game Im going to lay out some of my opinions for both sides of the ball regarding both teams From there my prediction will follow

Denvers Offense
I said it at the beginning of the year in the middle of the year and Ill say it again The Denver Broncos cant win a Super Bowl with Peyton Manning leading the way Now looking at that statement I cant say that the Broncos cant win this game But my point was that Peytons arm strength is too weak to beat really good defenses
Denver with Manning as the signalcaller doesnt have as good of a rushing attack Thats because defenses dont have to worry about the deep pass Carolina leads the league in turnovers and has a dominating front seven Denver wont be able to run in this one and Peyton isnt beating Carolinas secondary deep down the field
Carolinas Offense
Cams going to be the MVP and do you want to know one of the reasons why Its the same exact reason why a lot of people believe Chip Kelly is an idiot or cant coach Remember that read option attack that gained traction in the NFL just a few years ago Look at what the Panthers do so well on the ground Actually they do it better than any other team in the league Its the read option
People thought it couldnt work in the NFL Defenses are too fast Theyll adjust But you know what Its not about being faster at the next level The read option comes down to well a read by the quarterback It often times comes down to Cam against a defensive end or linebacker
That means Cam against a player who isnt as fast or as strong as him Thats a win for Cam and Carolinas rushing game The read option can work Just ask Cam Just ask Jonathan Stewart Hes a beneficiary as well
Back to Carolinas overall offense  Cam doesnt get enough credit for making the players around him better Ted Ginn Jr Jerricho Cotchery I dont need to say more He is as good at adlibbing as any other quarterback in the league You dont have to be Jerry Rice to get open when you have seven seconds to do it Thank Cam
Denvers Defense
This is where the Broncos have a shot in this game Everybody and their mother know this The key to the game though comes down to whether Denver can slow down the Panthers running game If they can it allows their front seven to pin their ears back and attack Cam Thats what they do best
Look at Carolinas offensive line Yeah theyre good but are Michael Oher a player the Titans cut and Mike Remmers going to stop guys like Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware I dont think so either Thats why you cant count Denver out You can never count out the best defense in the league They might not win but theyre not giving up 35 unless Peyton contributes to the Panthers cause
Theres a reason why the top defenses in the league commonly make the Super Bowl Total defensewise Seattle was and made backtoback trips The state of the NFL according to the average fan is pass pass pass score score score But do you know what the average team in the league scored in 2015 Roughly 23 points per game How about in 2002 About 22 points per game
The fact is every possession still matters Points come at a premium no matter the game in the NFL If Denvers defense can make life hell for Carolina by taking away the running game Peyton might not have to score 30 or more A 2017 Denver victory shouldnt shock anybody

Carolinas Defense
As I mentioned above Carolinas defense has a dominating front seven It seems like every player is great The narrative that this team is underappreciated may have worked 10 weeks ago but it doesnt anymore The Panthers had 10 players named to the Pro Bowl The next highest Seven by Seattle Arizona and New England
The Panthers have talent all over the place especially defensively Theyll be effective in this game Theres no doubt about it Denver better hope they can get their running game going which I dont think will happen because Peyton doesnt scare Carolinas defense Peyton hasnt turned the ball over so far this postseason Expect that to change
Prediction
What can actually happen in this game A Carolina beatdown Sure I can see it Peyton turns the ball over and Carolinas offense doesnt get slowed down A close game either way Yep I get it Denvers defense keeps it close and either can win it at the end or Peyton does just enough to pull out like I said a 2017 victory But can Denver run over Carolina That one I cant see happening
Most likely Denvers defense will do their thing Theyll slow down Cam and get after him The problem is Peyton and the offense scoring enough Again whats the most likely scenario Carolina scoring more than Denver or the Broncos edging out a close lowscoring victory My moneys on Carolina
Ill give the Panthers three scores and a couple field goals For the Broncos I can see two touchdowns and a couple field goals as well You cant predict defensive scores and while Ted Ginn Jr is electric on special teams it just isnt likely
Carolina has been the best overall team this season They proved it throughout the regular season and postseason I thought it was Arizona and I was wrong Im done picking against Carolina Cams the MVP and their defense is elite while leading the league in turnovers Just dont count out one of the top defenses weve ever seen in Denver
Panthers win 2720
