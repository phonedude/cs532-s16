                          The luncheon was held just south of downtown with about 100 in attendance Compared with other galas in this the host city for Super Bowl 50 the affair was modest lowkeyNone of the celebrities serving as attractions to the corporate megaparties showed up No Joe Montana No Iggy Azalea No Jamie Foxx The attire was decidedly Fridaycasual And the protocol was strictly seat yourself 8212 typically in a tent pitched on a sidewalk
  quotThank you thank you very muchquot said a soft halting voice from within one of a row of shelters lining 13th Street beneath a thrumming onramp to the Bay Bridge The tent flap unzipped Two hands reached out and retrieved a boxed meal of chicken salad quesadilla and a bottle of iced teaWith that volunteer Wayne Garcia and two helpers advanced with a loaded hand cart to the next tent
    
        
      quotFree food here Anybody hungry in therequot Garcia called outquotYesquot came the muted responsequotHow manyquotquotTwoquotAnother flap unzipped another set of hands emerged and two lunches

for an hour and so it has been going on all weekIn one of the more compelling confluences of Super Bowl excess and grinding human need a volunteer organization called Food Runners has been scooping up leftovers from catered football events The daily haul is redistributed to homeless shelters as well as to the ad hoc tent cities that have popped up on the outskirts of the city before the big gamequotI think we have a responsibility to feed our fellow human beingsquot said Mary Risley a former culinary school operator who founded Food Runners nearly 40 years ago quotIf we are able to do it with somebody elses leftover food 8212 greatquot                              Super Bowl 50 The game the entertainment the ads and more        The Denver Broncos defeated the carolina Panthers 2410

     A clash between San Franciscos homeless population and Super Bowl visitors has been anticipated for months Mayor Ed Lee warned somewhat infamously in August that any transients encamped near the site of a temporary quotSuper Bowl Cityquot attraction were quotgoing to have to leave the streetquotHis declaration though softened with expressions of support and compassion nonetheless riled homeless advocates 8212 who raised the specter of massive police sweeps in a campaign to sterilize downtown and the Embarcadero for the benefit of football fans and corporate sponsorsWith Super Bowls however reality in the end tends to overtake hyperboleThe showdown between the citys shuffling army of 3000plus streetbound homeless people and civic leaders determined to make the heart of the city pristine 8212 if only for a week 8212 came up a bit shortThere was a Thursday night protest at the Embarcadero which did not last long given a strong police presence And not all those living on the streets have been routed from the blocks surrounding the Super Bowl City site They could be seen this week usually in ones or twos instead of the more typical larger congregations That seemed to make the stragglers more visibleBut many had moved to the encampments beneath the Central Freeway Some came to escape the rains that have fallen in the last few weeks the freeway serving as their roof Others said they had been quotdirectedquot to the tent cities 8212 quotherded like cattlequot in one telling 8212 by police and other city workersThere has been much public discussion here about the migration about issues related to public health and neighborhood safety and civic values even about the wisdom of distributing free tentsSam Dodge the mayors point person on homelessness said officials have felt quota lot of heatquot during the Super Bowl buildup but added that it was not necessarily a negativequotIt is good we are able to shine some light on these issuesquot he saidFor Risley who helped round up the leftovers 8212 and for the handful of health workers who distributed them among the tent dwellers Friday 8212 policy discussions seemed a bit detached from what they had set out to doThey have been collecting and distributing restaurant leftovers since long before the Super Bowl came to town They will be doing so long after its overquotPeople are hungryquot said Garcia vice president of the nonprofit organization HealthRIGHT 360 a descendant of the HaightAshbury free clinics of the 1960s quotIts the right thing to doquotAlthough San Francisco is a foodie city in the extreme the Super Bowl did seem to spice up the fare honey mustard chicken thighs beef tenderloin dim sum stuffed naan breads red beans and rice Those and many more dishes were loaded onto the hand carts and taken to the tentsRisley said she would be rounding up party leftovers until 130 am SaturdayAlmost universally the recipients expressed gratitude although few left their tents They were asked no questions and in turn they asked none Except oncequotAnybody hungry in therequot Garcia called out as he did at every stopquotYesquotThis time a young man stepped from the tentquotDo you have anything veganquot he asked quotOr at least vegetarianquotHe was given a salad sans the butter chicken and the cart rolled onpeterkinglatimescomTwitter peterhkingFOR THE RECORDFeb 6 138 pm In an
