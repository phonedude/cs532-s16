                In the beginning there was 1984 With that one perfect throw of a sledgehammer the fabled Super Bowl commercial that introduced Apples Macintosh computer to the world more than three decades ago famouslynbspushered into existence the era of blockbuster advertisementsnbspelevating Super Bowl commercials to a level of popculture significance that rivals the game itselfnbspInnbspessence it was thenbspJaws of Super Bowl commercials a happy accident creating a media framework that would be replicated for generationsnbspnbsp

Its this creative arms race now in corporate America says Mike Sheldon CEO of the ad agency Deutsch North America Sheldon ran the creative team behind Volkswagens The Force spot in 2011 Along with 1984 it is widely regarded as one of the best Super Bowl ads of all time

The big numbers everybody tends to tout around the Super Bowl is how much networks charge brands for those precious 30 45nbspor 60 seconds of airtime But thats only part of what it costs to run a trueblue Super Bowl ad In addition to the 5 million spot price this year brands that want to be in the Big Game also typically have to purchase an equal dollar amount of advertising space elsewhere in the networks portfolio And then theres the cost of making the ad itself which can run an extra 5 or even 6 million
With a price tag of as much as 15 million then you could say theres a fair amount of pressure on the people making Super Bowl ads to deliver total perfection Id hate to be the marketer who spends five million bucks just for the time and then another five or six million to make it on one of these spots that come in dead last on the ad meter says Brent Smart CEO of the ad agency Saatchi amp Saatchi New York Thats a careerruiner
Smart hasnt had to deal with that kind of failure himself His team created Cheerios first Super Bowl ad in 2014 the one with the adorable small girl and interracial family which made it into the top five spots that year

That doesnt mean nobody blows it Groupon did a horribly distasteful spot with Timothy Hutton in 2011 Deutschs Sheldon says It totally blew up in their face and the agency got fired for it It was a disaster
A lot of Super Bowl ads try too hard put too many things in it and end up being a nonsensical mashup of 20 different things says Carlo Cavallone creative director of 72andSunny Amsterdam the agency behind Axes Super Bowl ad this year
So how do you avoid a bomb and create the kind of ad people talk about for years to come Were talking Chryslers Halftime in America commercial VWs The Force outing Apples 1984 spot We spoke with the people behind some of the best recent ads to find what works
Keep It Simple Stupid  You have to think of the environment Smart says Its normally watched in a crowd Its very noisy theres a lot going on You gotta stop the crowd Simple stories work much better Theres a difference though between simple and simplistic
And be careful about getting too outthere I dont think its about going superweird or overthetop Cavallone says
Laughs  Youre never gonna get hurt with humor Sheldon says The ads that consistently score highest are the ones that give you a pretty big belly laugh
Emotion  People are looking to be entertained Smart says Which doesnt necessarily mean being funny You can entertain by being moved emotionally as well Just maybe dont deliver quite as much emotion as Nationwides Dead Kid commercial did in 2015 Nationwide appears to be sitting it out this year
A Talking Donkey OK were just kidding about this one Although Cavallone does joke Id recommend to use a talking donkey whenever possible While a chatty burro may be too offbrand for most marketers Ed Brojerdi CEO of the ad agency KBS which was behind BMWs 2015nbspSuper Bowl spotnbspsays fauna in general can provide a nice boost to an existing emotional nugget You still need a great idea and great execution  the dogs just make it that much better Or donkey if you so choose
