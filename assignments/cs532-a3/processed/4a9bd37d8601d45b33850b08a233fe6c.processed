Dear MN State Legislator  

My name is John Consumer I am writing to urge you support Sunday Liquor sales in Minnesota Polls show that over 60 of Minnesota voters believe that small businesswomen and men should have the liberty to choose whether they are open to consumers on Sundays or not Governor Dayton has committed to signing a bill supporting consumers We have an opportunity to expand consumer and retailer choice increase private economic business activity and increase revenue for business and important government programs all at the same time 
Support Minnesota support Sunday liquor sales 

I look forward to hearing from you Thank you

Sincerely

John Consumer
