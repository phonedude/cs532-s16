Urban Wildlife  Tawny Owl





Tawny owl Strix aluco  John Black




Fascinating Fact about Tawny Owl
The tawny owl is one of the most common owls in Britain with a population of about 20000 breeding pairs It is able to live in a wide variety of habitats Despite this
because it is nocturnal it is rarely seen Most often we only know of its presence by the familiar deep tuwoo or keewick most commonly heard about two hours after sunset in late autumn or winter





All about Tawny Owl



	What to look for

	The tawny owl is 37  39cm long with a rounded head body and wings It has large brown eyes with its face surrounded by a ring of dark feathers Its upper parts are usually reddish
	brown with a line of dark and light patches on its wings and crown of the head The under parts are yellowishbeige and often streaked

	When and where to see

	The tawny owl lives in woodlands wooded farmland and parkland It can also be found in towns where there are large trees such as in parks and churchyards Due to it being nocturnal and it having a well camoufl aged brown body it is very difficult to spot Sometimes it can be seen in daylight but only when it is disturbed If this does happen its presence
	is often revealed by the mob of small birds which are harassing it

	Did you know

	
		Tawny owls have permanent territories which they patrol very conscientiously and appear to know very well Within their territory their roosting place is regularly changed
	
		In urban areas tawny owls prey mainly on birds such as sparrows thrushes blackbirds and starlings Rodents make up only about 7 of the urban owlrsquos total diet In the countryside the owls eat few birds The hunting methods of city and country owls also vary in city areas small birds are snatched from their roosts Places like roofs and
		telegraph poles are used as vantage points to hunt from Countryside owls usually perch close to the ground and wait for their prey to appear then pounce
	
		The tawny owlrsquos feathers have a velvety pile and fine fringe that help to reduce the noise of the wings when fl ying so the owl can approach its prey as quietly as possible When hunting tawny owls rely heavily upon their sight and hearing and use their talons only during the attack
	
		In the breeding season tawny owls nest in tree cavities old crowsrsquo nests squirrel dreys and nest boxes only when these are not available it will nest on the ground The tawny owl lays 23 large white round eggs in late February or March and incubates them for 2830 days The young tend to leave the nest about 4 weeks after hatching but are still dependent on their parents for 23 months afterwards and sometimes on into autumn Often only 1 or 2 owlets per pair reach adulthood
