    The Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers reached Super Bowl 50 by way of two very different paths To understand who will arrive at their destination you have to understand the journey nbsp nbspnbsp
nbsp
Four Years of LastDitch Efforts
John Elway faced a rapidly shrinking Super Bowl target at the end of last season
The Broncos general managerliving legend had just watched his team endure an ugly 2413 playoff loss to the Indianapolis Colts The previous season the Broncos championship hopes were pulverized in a humiliating 438 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl The year before that the Broncos suffered a fourthquarter defensive lapse that allowed the Baltimore Ravens to force overtime and win a wild 3835 divisionalround showdown in Denver
Their 3810 regularseason record over those three seasons was little consolation Elways Broncos kept getting stopped short of their goal and that goal was starting to get further away So Elway swapped out head coach John Fox in favor of Gary Kubiak
This is why we made the decision Elway said Monday of the teams mutual parting of ways with Fox after last season We had a good regular season but struggled in the first round So the goalmdashwhat our owner Pat Bowlen wantsmdashis to win a championship Thats why the decision was made last year to go in a different direction
It was the latest bold decision in four years of bold decisions The Broncos took a risk on damagedgoods superstar Peyton Manning in 2012 Its easy to forget how daring that move was We spent the 2012 offseason tracking Mannings flights from suitor to suitor then spent the preseason watching every practice rep for signs of lost passing velocity

            Veteran DeMarcus Ware is one of Elways shortterm boost acquisitions
        
    
After the Super Bowl XLVIII debacle Elway invested heavily in his defense so it could ease the burden on the offense The Broncos acquired DeMarcus Ware Aqib Talib TJ Ward and others These were expensive shortterm investments particularly Ware Elway doubled down on the Manning window of opportunity in 2014 only to see Manning falter down the stretch
Hiring Kubiak looked like a hedge against Mannings age Elway even negotiated a few million dollars in cap relief from Manning himself But it was really a triple down Kubiak brought a system that would have shackled the young Manning but provided increased pass protection for the old Manning His system was also friendly to Brock Osweiler when the fourthyear pro had to take the reins Kubiaks scheme has always been friendly to young guys with cannon arms
Most importantly Kubiak came with defensive wingman Wade Phillips in tow to supercharge the defense
Elway kept piling chips on the table for 2015 through August when he signed veteran guard Evan Mathis for 25 million plus bonuses to spackle the offensive line
Evan Mathis contract1M SB15M base 750K in pergame RB55 snaps 18750065 350k75 56250085 750kMax value 4Mmdash Field Yates FieldYates August 27 2015

He was like a homeowner in the last stages of a major renovation Money doesnt matter anymore just finish the damn job It has been a remarkable fouryear feat of shortterm planning Quick fixes rarely work in the NFL but Elway kept using them to get lasting results
After Super Bowl 50 Elway will likely find himself low on cap space out of Manning encores and out of bold moves The Broncos are in need of one last finishing kick Elway must hope they did not use it to get past the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots in the playoffs

Gettlemans Homestyle Cooking
Dave Gettleman did nothing this offseason
No thats not really true The Panthers general manager popped some budget friendly freeagent tags signing tackle Michael Oher and veteran cornerback Charles Tillman bringing back Ted Ginn Jr and making some other undertheradar transactions

            Dave Gettleman
        
    
But Gettleman stood mostly pat after his Panthers fell from 124 in 2013 to 781mdashthough with a weird playoff codamdashin 2014 Even when star wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin tore an ACL in training camp leaving the Panthers receiving corps frighteningly thin Gettleman stayed the course instead of calling Wes Welker or Terrell Owens or somebody
Staying the course had been Gettlemans core philosophy since he arrived from the New York Giants in 2013 and inherited a head coach with a pair of losing seasons under his belt a quarterback with a reputation then earned for immaturity and a salarycap boondoggle
Most general managers would start their tenures by making wholesale changes Gettleman took a different approach
I just made up my mind that I was going to give everybody a chance he said Monday
It was a slowbuilding philosophy he said he learned as a scout for Marv Levys great Buffalo Bills teams of the early 1990s an approach that carried over to his tenure in the front office of the Super Bowlwinning Giants teams of 2007 and 2011
Just think about it Gettleman said If youve got somebody working for you and you fire him and bring the next guy in how long is it gonna take you to train the next guy It takes time It doesnt happen overnight In the time it takes to get the next guy ready you lost three or six months
Gettleman retained Rivera He was forced to make some difficult cap decisionsmdashreleasing Steve Smith Sr most notablymdashbut he kept many holdovers from Marty Hurneys era as general manager Jonathan Stewart Greg Olsen Charles Johnson Thomas Davis Dwan Edwards Josh Norman Ryan Kalil Luke Kuechly and of course Cam Newton were already on the Panthers roster when Gettleman arrived
Maybe young players like Newton Kuechly and Norman would have developed under a different coaching staff Gettleman didnt want to find out
More often than not 999 percent of the time the guys going to come in with his offense and his defense Gettleman said Now can you fit How much turnover are you going to have
Gettleman isnt conservative to a faultmdashthe way Ted Thompson of the Green Bay Packers has become The Panthers traded for passrusher Jared Allen to upgrade their defensive line after this seasons strong start They pulled veteran cornerback Cortland Finnegan off the waiver wire when Tillman and others were hurt in the secondary

    
                  

          
        
        
            

            
                Sean GardnerGetty Images
            
        
        
    

    
        
            
            Ted Ginn Jr and Devin Funchess
        
    
But like Thompson and the Bills and Giants executives he learned from Gettleman takes a developmental approach to turning lateround picks into role players or in the case of Norman superstars Gettleman admitted Wednesday to fearing that the Panthers took a step backward this year when Benjamin got hurt saying he thought he entered training camp with an 11 or 12win team but Youd have to be an idiot to think that after such a major loss Still Gettleman opted to let Ginn and Devin Funchess grow into adjusted roles a decision every bit as risky as Elways pricey acquisitionsmdashbut in the opposite way
Its a slowcooking approach to roster management On Sunday as Newton might say the collard greens are finally ready
nbsp
Ghosts of XLVIII
Elways Broncos and Gettlemans Panthers provide a fascinating contrast in styles urgency versus patience Last Chance Saloon versus the Birth of a Dynasty
Ironically the team with the 39yearold codger at quarterback is the hare while the hyperathletic demonstrative Newton helms the tortoise
Its easy to paint Super Bowl 50 as Mannings last gasp against Newtons first Super Bowl appearance of many to come But as has been pointed out several times this week Dan Marino never reached the Super Bowl again after his second season and we have been counting Manning out since 2011
Still one look at the game tape or the stat sheet or just the trajectories of these franchises leads to an inevitable conclusion The Panthers are going to win Super Bowl 50
That may be why the shadow of Super Bowl XLVIII looms over the Broncosmdashand over our perception of this game
What I hopemdashas a broadcaster who is doing the game both on radio and TVmdashall I want is a really good game like we got in Super Bowl XLIX Boomer Esiason said early in the week I dont want what we saw in XLVIII because if that happens everybody loses interest no matter how well Cam plays I hope Peyton can keep it close
But Boomer what about Mannings experience the lessons the Broncos learned two years ago and the urgency that comes with the specter of retirement
If Peyton were 27 Id say yeah Esiason said But hes going to be 40 in March Hes playing against an awesome defensemdash39 turnovers in the regular season plus20 turnover differentialmdashhes got a lot of heavy lifting And this is not the Peyton Manning offense This is the Gary Kubiak offense that we saw in Houston This is the Gary Kubiak offense that John Elway won a couple of Super Bowls with but they dont have those same types of players They dont have that offensive line They dont have those types of running backs You have a 39yearold livinglegacy quarterback going against a topnotch defense

            Super Bowl 50 could be Peyton Mannings final NFL game
        
    
Thats a pessimistic evaluation from an individual who knows his way around a Super Bowl and is in the business of being as balanced as possible But it represents a majority opinion of just about everyone I have spoken to in the bleachers during Senior Bowl practices and in the aisles of Super Bowl radio row Its the obvious conclusion no matter how much you dig and sift through the statistical matchups the Broncos have some advantages cornerbacks against receivers special teams consistency but the Panthers have all the big ones like being the team capable of scoring more touchdowns and forcing more turnovers
The Panthers are still improving Thats why they were so easy to misjudge all season Thats why Newton is still fighting his way through perceptions They have so many key playersmdashNewton Kuechly Norman Kawann Shortmdashwho are still in the process of peaking The Broncos are led by many players who are at or past their peak with notable exceptions like Chris Harris Jr
No wonder this game feels like Super Bowl XLVIII The Broncos are older and wiser than they were two years ago but they are past the point where trading age for wisdom is a good thing And they are facing a team so good that it doesnt know its own strength
The Broncos must stack every possible advantage up to win this game They need a strong performance from CJ Anderson and a running game that has waxed and waned all season They need the defense to play lights out no problem and penaltyfree more of a problem They need Brandon McManus to turn short drives into long field goals And of course they need Manning to throw each pass as if its his last
All the Panthers need to do to win this game is show up and be the Panthers If that happens this is a mismatch
Its amazing that Elway Manning and the Broncos remained this good for this long For the second time in three years however they are about to give way to a rising powerhouse built from a newfangled offense around a millennial quarterback but also built from some oldfashioned ideas of how to win a championship
Prediction Panthers 26 Broncos 17
