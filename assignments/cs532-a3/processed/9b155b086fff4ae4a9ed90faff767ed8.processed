  Halfway through Thursdays feistynbspDemocratic debate the conversation turned to ISIS Bernie Sanders as he often does brought up Clintons vote to authorize the Iraq War in 2002 Where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq he said
But Clinton was ready with a new rebuttal  and a more effective one A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS Heres the full text of her response met with a round of applause from the Democratic audience

  
  
    
  



Look we did differ A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS We have to look at the threats that we face right now and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them

For once Clinton didnt sound defensive on her 2002 vote which she now says was a mistake Instead she put the issue in the past and instead turned the debate back to one of Sanderss weaknesses his relatively thin rsum and knowledge base on foreign policy
Throughout his career in Congress Sanders has focused on domestic policy issues which makes him fairly reliant on preprepared arguments on foreign policy like Clintons 2002 Iraq War vote Clinton is pointing that out and implicitly questioning Sanderss fitness to deal withnbspISIS as a result Its certainly not a perfect answer  Democrats are still not thrilled with her vote for Bushs war  but its much better than what shes given in the past
