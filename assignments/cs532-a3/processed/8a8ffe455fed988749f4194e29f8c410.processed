                    This man does not like to be disturbed while hes running the US
                
            
            
        A review of the best commentary on and around the worldTodays mustreadThe US is dominated by a rich and powerful eliteSo concludes a recent study by Princeton University Prof Martin Gilens and Northwestern University Prof Benjamin I PageThis is not news you sayPerhaps but the two professors have conducted exhaustive research to try to present datadriven support for this conclusion Heres how they explain itMultivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organised groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy while average citizens and massbased interest groups have little or no independent influence In English the wealthy few move policy while the average American has little powerThe two professors came to this conclusion after reviewing answers to 1779 survey questions asked between 1981 and 2002 on public policy issues They broke the responses down by income level and then determined how often certain income levels and organised interest groups saw their policy preferences enactedA proposed policy change with low support among economically elite Americans oneoutoffive in favour is adopted only about 18 of the time they write while a proposed change with high support fouroutoffive in favour is adopted about 45 of the timeOn the other handWhen a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites andor with organised interests they generally lose Moreover because of the strong status quo bias built into the US political system even when fairly large majorities of Americans favour policy change they generally do not get it They concludeAmericans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance such as regular elections freedom of speech and association and a widespread if still contested franchise But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful business organisations and a small number of affluent Americans then Americas claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened Eric Zuess writing in Counterpunch isnt surprised by the surveys resultsAmerican democracy is a sham no matter how much its pumped by the oligarchs who run the country and who control the nations news media he writes The US in other words is basically similar to Russia or most other dubious electoral democratic countries We werent formerly but we clearly are nowThis is the Duh Report says Death and Taxes magazines Robyn Pennacchia Maybe she writes Americans should just accept their fatePerhaps we ought to suck it up admit we have a classist society and do like England where we have a House of Lords and a House of Commoners she writes instead of pretending as though we all have some kind of equal opportunity hereSouth KoreaFerry tragedy was a manmade disaster  The death toll from the sinking of the Sewol off the southeastern tip of South Korea could have been greatly reduced if the passengers had been properly instructed in safety procedures and the crew hadnt been among the first to abandon the ship write the editors of South Koreas Joongang DailyThe South Korean government also shares blame they write It failed to grasp the seriousness of the accident from the start and didnt know how many were rescued or missingThe government they continue should conduct a thorough investigation and prepare a report on how to upgrade the nations safety systems and proceduresArgentinaCristina Kirchners sham populism  The government of Cristina Kirchner touts a populism that redistributes wealth to benefit the poor writes Luis Alberto Romero in Agentinas Clarin translated by WorldCrunchIn reality he says the outcome has been greater wealth concentrations and more social polarisation helped by subsidy policiesThe Kirchner regime he argues has been built on two foundations concentration of power and accumulation of wealthAlgeriaPresidential vote endorses status quo  It seems clear that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will win a fourth term in this weeks election despite looking more dead than alive writes University of Houston Prof Robert Zaretsky in the Los Angeles TimesMr Bouteflika is entrenched propped up by generals and an uneasy status quo he says The question is he writes how long will the government manage to impose scripted elections on a population ready for the risks and rewards of an unscripted futureUkraineNato football v Russian chess  The Ukrainian crisis has taken Nato planners by surprise writes Prof David Murphy of National University of Ireland Maynooth in the Irish Times This he says is because of fundamental cultural strategic and political differences between Russia and the WestNato operates at a huge disadvantage as it needs consensus and cooperation within its member states in order to act he writes President Vladimir Putin and his political and military staffs do not face such limitations and have the freedom to act quicklyRussia has formulated a plan and is executing it he concludes It is up to the members of Nato to work together to stop itBBC Monitorings quotes of the dayUkrainian media respond to highlevel meetings between officials from the US EU Ukraine and Russia in Geneva aimed resolving the crisis in UkraineThere is an illusory hope for the conference in Geneva Ukraine will be presented there as a pie which will be divided Everything  shows the signs of a grand plot where big geopolitical players resolved their issues at Ukraines expense It will be like that this time around too  Editorial in Glavkom Todays meeting will show if the West can counter Vladimir Putins plans to impose his world order  Editorial in Den International talks will hardly improve the situation in Ukraine until people inside the country start talking So the only thing the Geneva meeting could influence is to facilitate the beginning of talks inside the country between representatives of the east and the central authorities If the meeting provides this impetus it will be a positive result
