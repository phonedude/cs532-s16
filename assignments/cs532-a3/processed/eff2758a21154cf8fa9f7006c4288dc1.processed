        Super Bowl 50 predictions Panthers or Broncos Here are our picksBy Nate Peterson  CBSSportscom

        Will Peyton Manning ride off a winner in possibly his last rodeo Or Will Super Bowl 50 be the coronation of Cam Newton and the PanthersWatch SB 50 onlineClick here to watch title game online on CBSAfter a week full of endless questions and hype well get answers on Super Bowl Sunday when one team walks away with the Lombardi Trophy Superman vs the Sheriff No 1 seed vs No 1 seed No 1 offense vs No 1 defense Its the Panthers against the Broncos Its time for Super Bowl 50 CBSSportscoms intrepid team of NFL writers have submitted their final Super Bowl picks predicting the final score along with the game MVP Check out their thoughts below and feel free to add your two cents in the comments section2015 Super Bowl final predictions Panthers at BroncosWriterWinnerScoreSuper Bowl MVPPETE PRISCOSenior NFL Columnist Broncos 23 Panthers 21MVP Von MillerPRISCOS TAKE As much as I love offense defense will win this championship Thats not to say Carolinas defense isnt good but this Denver defense is rolling right nowWhy Pass rushers and corners the formula for any good defense In Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware they have the edge rushers to disrupt any offense In Aqib Talib Chris Harris Jr and Bradley Roby they have the cover players to allow them to do a lot of different things on defenseThats something that will help give them an edge on Cam Newton His offense and especially his run game is so diverse That can put pressure on the Broncos to be less aggressive but I doubt they will beThey will be who they are and they should beThat means Miller and Ware attacking with Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson holding up inside with the cover corners locking up down the field The Carolina defense will play well too but I think Manning will be patient and find holes in their zoneIt will be a turnover late caused by that Denver rush that proves to be the difference They will get a late field goal off of it then hold on to win Then Manning will go to the podium to help pick up his second Lombardi Trophy and then promptly tell all the haters to kiss his backsideNot an alltime great Think againOnly this time he will have an alltime great defense to thank for itJASON LA CANFORACBS Sports NFL Insider Panthers 24 Broncos 17MVP Cam NewtonLA CANFORAS TAKE Too much Cam Newton Not enough Broncos offenseThe Broncos wont be able to pin back and attack the passer and if they let Cam Newton break contain he will kill them on the ground If they can keep Carolina from jumping to a fast start then weve got a game Otherwise it could get uglyThe Broncos arent built to play from behind and I dont see them mustering more than a touchdown or two Turnovers could obviously swing things dramatically one way or the other but I dont see this being a stage thats too big for the young Panthers and mustering 270 yards of total offense again will put a tremendous strain on a Denver defense facing a much more multiple and balanced offense Sunday than it did two weeks agoCam Newton collects some more hardware on the big stageJARED DUBINNFL Writer Panthers 20 Broncos 16 MVP Cam NewtonDUBINS TAKEThe Panthers season has been all about dominant defense and Cam Newton being the best player on the field The Panthers forced turnovers on a greater percentage of their opponents drives than any other team in the league this season while Peyton Manning was the NFLs most pickhappy QB before bowing out with an injury for a large stretch of the season Manning has gone INTless during Denvers run to the Super Bowl but the Patriots dropped three or four picks last week alone so its reasonable to expect that run to come to an end on Sunday Unless he plays a completely mistakefree game its hard to see Denver scoring enough to keep up with the Panthers even if the Broncos defensive front can get pressure on NewtonGreg Olsen presents problems over the middle for the Denver defense no matter who they choose to match up with him and Cam is a completely different threat than either QB the Broncos faced during their jaunt through the AFC playoffs His ability to not just deliver the ball under pressure but escape it to take off and run down the field presents a great challenge unlike any Denver has faced this year I see him crossing the goal line for a rushing score and throwing for another while the defense puts the clamps on Mannings offense When its all said and done Cam will have two MVP trophies to put on his shelfRYAN WILSONNFL Writer  Broncos 17 Panthers 14MVP Von MillerWILSONS TAKETwo years ago the Broncos Super Bowl hopes were dashed after just one play For them to have any chance this time around the defense will have to play out of its mind And thats saying something because this unit is already the best in the league But without the old Peyton Manning 040as opposed to just old Peyton Manning041 theres little reason to think that Denvers offense can do enough to stave off the highpowered PanthersBut as weve seen more most of the season Denvers offense just stayed out of the way while the D was in fullon shutdown mode And for the most part it worked Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips needs a huge game from Von Miller who can at times be unstoppable Phillips will also need Aqib Talib and the secondary to blanket a  lets be honest  a group of underwhelming receivers after you get past Greg OlsenThe wild card of course is Cam Newton Can Phillips do enough to slow him down Can the Broncos create turnovers and turn them into points Because if that happens Mannings responsibilities go from We need you to throw for 400 yards to just dont throw any stupid interceptions and the Broncos can lean on CJ Anderson and Ronnie Hillman We actually think theres decent chance that happens Peyton matches his brother in Super Bowl rings and calls it a careerJOHN BREECHNFL Writer Broncos 23 Panthers 20MVP Peyton ManningBREECHS TAKE Peyton Manning actually looks healthy like hes been eating a few less chicken parms and a few more apples Now that doesnt mean hes going to throw for 413 yards against the Panthers but it does mean he could surprise the Panthers with his arm strength and ability to throw downfieldOn the other hand the Broncos might not even need a huge game from Manning because this games going to come down to whether or not the Broncos defense can stop Cam Newton The Broncos arent going to win a shootout and if the Panthers hit the 30point mark theres a 196 percent chance theyre going to winThat being said youve probably heard that defense wins championships and if thats the case then Carolina might want to forfeitThe Broncos defense finished ranked No 1 overall in the NFL this regular season which is usually a good sign for a Super Bowl team Of the 11 teams before 2015 that went into a Super Bowl with the topranked defense nine of them won I think its going to be 10 after SundayOn Sept 9 2015 I said the Broncos would win Super Bowl 50 and that Peyton Manning would be named MVP Im sticking by both predictionsSEAN WAGNERMcGOUGH NFL Writer  Panthers 28 Broncos 17MVP Cam Newton WAGNERMcGOUGHS TAKE Denvers defense makes the Broncos a tempting pick  so much that I was actually going to ride with them right up until Thursday morning But after sleeping on it for the past four or five days I still cant figure out how the Broncos are going to score on the Panthers defenseBoth teams will struggle to score in this one and Denvers pass rush will give Peyton Manning a fourthquarter shot but eventually the Panthers and their topscoring offense break through and force the Broncos into predictable passing situations which should make Peyton Manning good for a turnover or two After all he threw 17 picks in 10 regularseason games while the Panthers led the league with 39 takeaways That should set up Cam Newton and the Panthers offense with a few short fields and theyve been nearly unstoppable near the end zone scoring a touchdown on 10 of their past 11 redzone tripsAgain I dont think this is blowout The Broncos defense is too dang good to get run out of a game which will allow the Broncos to hang around and hey maybe even pull off the Hollywood ending for Manning But in the end the Panthers wont let Manning capture his second ring   Its time to crown a champion 040USATSI041
