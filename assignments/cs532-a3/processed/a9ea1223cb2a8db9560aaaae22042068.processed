        Theres a good chance that the most popular Super Bowl commercial in St Louis is going to be a commercial thats only seen in St LouisSB 50 on TV onlineHow to watch the title game on TV online on CBS Terry Crouppen a lawyer in the city decided to buy an ad for the big game so that he could do one thing bash Rams owner Stan Kroenke for moving the team The only catch to the ad is that it wont be airing nationally it will only be airing in the city that Kroenke ditchedIn the commercial the lawyer gives Kroenke some free legal adviceIm Terry Crouppen You know my hometown St Louis We were loyal to our football team We bought their tickets wore their jerseys drank their overpriced beer We cheered them year after losing year and in return they trashed us then left us Stan youre worth 0368 billion dollars Thats not enough Well heres some free advice Just because its legal and youre rich enough to do it  that doesnt make it right  Stan Kroenke is not a popular man in St Louis 040USATSI041 The commercial ends with the hashtag SlamStan and since Kroenke is basically the least popular person in St Louis right now it wont be a surprise at all if that hashtag starts trending on Super Bowl SundayThe latest from SportsLineSB 50 Our 20 favorite prop playsCrouppen sent out a press release for his ad just to make sure everyone in St Louis knows to watch out for it in the first halfIve heard from hundreds of friends and strangers in the last few weeks about their disappointment over the Rams situation Crouppen said via Fox 2 in St Louis I couldnt stand silently by while Kroenke broke our citys heart with the move to Los Angeles So I do what Ive done my entire career took to the airwaves to advocate on behalf of those who dont have a say in the matter but care as deeply as I doYou can see the entire ad below
