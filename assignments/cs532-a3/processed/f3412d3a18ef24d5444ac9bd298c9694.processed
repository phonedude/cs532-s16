    The wait is almost overSuper Bowl 50 kicks off Sunday with Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos taking on Cam Newton and the Carolina PanthersHeres what you need to knowNewton unstoppableThe NFL39s soontobe MVP will face his toughest matchup yet in going headtohead with the topranked Broncos defenseDenver is fresh off a dominant AFC title game performance against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots but Cam Newton is now far and away the NFLs most difficult player to defendAs talented as the Broncos39 defense may be across the board it appears entirely possible that there simply isn39t an answer for Newton39s ability as a dualthreat quarterbackHes elevated the play of an otherwise underwhelming supporting cast throughout the 2015 season and that should only continue in his first appearance on footballs biggest stageCapping off the incredible season with a Lombardi Trophy and a Super Bowl MVP award would be the final steps in making Newton39s 2015 campaign one of the best in NFL historyOne last ride for ManningPeyton Mannings expected retirement has been the talk of the league since the Broncos earned their spot in the Super Bowl Win or lose the future Hall of Famer is widely expected to call it a career after an incredible 18 seasons Though hes clearly no longer the player he once was would anyone be all that surprised if hes got one last magical performance left in the tankTheres little disputing that his physical skill set is in the midst of a rapid decline Manning can no longer push the ball downfield and thats limited the ways in which he can attack opposing defensesBut the unmatched mental processing hasnt gone anywhere With his ability to decipher defensive coverages presnap getting the offense into the best play more often than not Denvers best chance to win certainly still comes with No 18 under centerFor a legendary player whose playoff shortcomings have earned him an unfair amount of criticism going out with a second Super Bowl ring would be quite the finish to his illustrious pro careerThe Panthers39 LinebackersThe key to Carolinas continued success on the defensive side of the ball is the superstar linebacker duo of Luke Kuechly and Thomas DavisEach are among the NFLs most wellrounded players at the position with their consistent production in pass coverage representing the most important factor in potentially knocking off the BroncosThis group more than any other across the league is best equipped to exploit Mannings limitations as a passer Their presence underneath has the potential to both force him out of his comfort zone and force some gamechanging turnoversKuechly 24 likely has a long career ahead of him but Davis is an 11thyear veteran who39s fought through an incredible amount of injuries to get to his first career Super BowlHaving overcome three ACL tears to reemerge as one of the league39s top defensive players a broken arm suffered in the NFC Championship Game wasn39t about to keep him on the sidelinesThe Broncos39 defensive frontThe Broncos chances of limiting Newtons effectiveness start with the contributions of a starstudded defensive frontVon Miller and DeMarcus Ware will certainly be relied upon to get in the backfield as passrushers but their responsibilities will change with a quarterback of Newton39s talent39s under centerMaintaining their respective passrush lanes and particularly so on the edge becomes imperative in taking away the potential for him to escape the pocket and either extend a play or take off as a runnerAs much as Newton39s now developed as a pure pocket passer the Broncos would much rather force him to test a strong defensive backfield than allow him to make plays with his legsFieldposition battleWith a pair of strong defenses making it quite possible that this game ends up the lowestscoring Super Bowl in recent memory winning the fieldposition battle will be a focus from the outsetAssuming that each team is thus given ample opportunities to field punts and make plays in the return game perhaps the advantage in this respect goes to CarolinaTedd Ginn a journeyman former firstround pick has finally found a home with the Panthers Not only is he making plays as a deep threat on the offensive side but his athletic abilities are also being put to use as a return manGinn finished the regular season ranked fifth among NFL punt returners with an impressive average of 103 yards per return His 32yard return in the NFC title game was mere inches away from going back for a touchdown further demonstrating the explosive ability he has with the ball in his hands
