JustificationThis species is classified as Critically Endangered since it has an extremely small range occurring at only one location an active volcano where clearance of forest for agriculture by the islands large and increasing human population is causing a continuing decline in the area of suitable habitat and thus its extent of occurrence area of occupancy and population

Distribution and populationOtus pauliani is found only on Mt Karthala an active volcano on Grand Comoro  Ngazidja in the Comoro IslandsPopulation justificationIn November 1989 studies revealed its presence on the northern western and southern flanks of the volcano where about 100 km2 of suitable habitat exists and the population may prove to be over 1000 pairs160Herremans160et al1601991a In September 2005 the species was found to be abundant on the southeastern flanks of the Karthala which may increase the population estimate However no formal revised estimate is available and the extent of suitable habitat will have been reduced since 1989 The estimate is thus retained at 2000 individuals roughly equivalent to at least 1300 mature individualsTrend justificationThis speciess population is suspected to be declining at a rate of 119 over ten years in line with habitat loss and degradation within its rangeEcologyThis species occurs from 650 m upwards to the tree line Louette et al in prep It is territorial occurring in primary montane evergreen forest favouring areas with old hollow trees but is also found in pioneer forest forest that grows on rocky soils Louette et al 1988 Louette et al 1990 and regenerating forest dominated by Psidium cattleianum Louette et al in prep It shows a preference for edge habitat either edges along the upper limits of the forest where it is replaced by giant heath Philippia edges along old lavaflows or edges of open areas within the forest itself Louette et al 1988 Its feeding and breeding ecology are unknown ThreatsSince 1983 intact forest may have declined by over 25 as agriculture on all but the poorest soils has advanced steadily up the slopes of Mt Karthala toward the habitat of O pauliani Safford 2001 There is large clearance for road construction on the western side above Mvouni relatively intensive logging for plank production using chainsaws in the south above Kourani and cattle grazing on the Phillipia heaths in the highlands K Green in litt 2012 Secondary forest in the agricultural belt on the mountain is dominated by exotic plants particularly strawberry guava Psidium cattleianum Safford 2001 which could spread into and degrade remaining native forest Commercial logging occurs in a 50 km2 concession on the southwestern slopes Safford 2001 Pioneer forest although unsuitable for agriculture and of little value for logging is susceptible to fire and may be burnt to provide grassland for cattle Louette et al 1990 Grazing is increasing  even at high altitudes  and could prohibit forest regeneration Louette and Stevens 1992 Louette et al 1988 Introduced rats and Common Myna Acridotheres tristis may act as competitors or nest predators Safford 2001 If plans to build a road to Mt Karthalas crater are resurrected exploitation and fragmentation of the forest and the spread of exotic species could be accelerated Safford 2001Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II A protected area national park biosphere reserve or resource management area on Mt Karthala has been suggested but has not yet materialised Louette and Stevens 1992 Safford 2001 Protected area planning was underway for the Karthala forests in 2012 K Green in litt 2012Conservation Actions ProposedResearch the ecology of this species to aid conservation plans Create a protected area on Mt Karthala to encompass the remaining native forest and develop a landuse strategy Louette and Stevens 1992 Safford 2001 Encourage locallyorganised ecotourism as an alternative source of income for inhabitants of the Mt Karthala area Safford 2001 Develop an environmental education programme on the island Louette and Stevens 1992
