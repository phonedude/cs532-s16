When it was announced just minutes prior to tipoff Saturday that Alex Poythress would not be able to play due to an injury to his right nonsurgically repaired knee anxiety swept over the Big Blue Nation
Kentucky attempting to avoid its first threegame losing streak ever under head coach John Calipari was coming off a loss at Tennessee in which it blew a 21point firsthalf lead its largest in the Calipari era What ensued was a muchimproved performance by a Kentucky team needing it
It was a great bounceback game Calipari said

Postgame Coverage
Box score  Notes  Photo gallery  Coach Cals postFlorida presser  Murray Ulis Humphriesdiscuss Florida win Video UKFlorida intro Humphriesturns pregame nerves into timely success against Florida

The Wildcats 176 73 Southeastern Conference scored on seven of their first nine possessions of the game and led by double digits for all but three minutes and 24 seconds en route to winning 8061 and moving to within a game of first place in the SEC
They were so good against Tennessee early and I could see that we just saw that for 40 minutes Florida head coach Mike White said  If you let a guy like Jamal Murray really get going early and hes got his mojo going and Tyler Ulis is playing like he did today theyre capable of beating anyone in college basketball
Murray was on fire from beginning to end Saturday tying a UK freshman scoring record with 35 points including eight 3pointers on just 10 attempts The Kitchener Ontario natives eight made 3point field goals tied a record for a player regardless of class in the Calipari era

I knew he had a lot of points Coach Cal said He knew he had a lot
Murray hit his first six 3pointers of the game including all five in the first half but contends that he wasnt paying attention to how many points he had until the end The rookies 35 points makes him the first freshman with multiple 30point performances in school history
Jamal Murray stole the show with his ability to make shots White said I think hes still open right now Ive never been a part of anything like that very very discouraged Its like we didnt know that hes a good shooter Not a very good effort I wish we would have given Jamal a better effort He was unbelievable Hes a really good shooter and they did a great job of getting him open
Not to be outdone Ulis logged his third doubledouble of the year with 18 points and a careerhigh 11 assists joining former UK star John Wall as the only players under Calipari with 10plus assists in multiple games Together Ulis and Murray combined to score 30 of UKs first 39 points
Prior to the game Calipari told his sophomore point guard that hed have an opportunity for 15 assists against the Gators with the way they play defensively While he came up just shy of that gaudy mark he impressed yet another opposing coach and strengthened his season averages to 64 assists per game with a 32 assisttoturnover ratio Ulis is now the first Wildcat with at least four assists in 16 consecutive games since Roger Harden in 198586
I thought Ulis really controlled the entire first half offensively and defensively White said He didnt allow our guards to even get into ball screens defensively I thought he put on a clinic some of those things that wont show up in the box score offensively He runs the show

In the frontcourt freshman forward Isaac Humphries stepped up in Poythress absence After playing just 16 minutes in the previous 12 games including not playing in eight games Humphries logged 15 minutes against the Gators scored four points grabbed six rebounds including three offensive and blocked two shots
He earned his space and I8217m so happy for him because he has worked so hard and hasn8217t had the opportunity and what he did was he took advantage and we all look and say he needs to play Coach Cal said Let him play And then you8217ve got to stop waiting on some other guys you8217ve got to say hey he deserves it
Humphries found out hed get the start just minutes prior to the opening tip and said he was on a mission to prove himself Saturday
I finally got an opportunity and now Ive got to continue growing on that Humphries said In Coachs eyes he will see my progression and hell be more comfortable with playing me
In practice Thursday and Friday the Wildcats went after each other including a twoandahalf hour session Thursday in which they focused primarily on defense and rebounding The end result was a game in which UKs physicality surprised Florida White said and pleased Calipari

After allowing 111 points per possession at Kansas and a seasonhigh 125 at Tennessee Kentucky allowed just 094 points per possession to Florida The Gators 61 total points marked their second lowest outing since Dec 12 and was far below their 750 points per game average
Thats all weve been focusing on Ulis said of the Cats defense The last couple of games we broke down a lot defensively and were trying to get back to where we were earlier We understand as a team we cant just win on offense
The win marked Kentuckys 33rd in a row at Rupp Arena tying the second longest winning streak in the arenas history and gave Kentucky plenty of confidence with eight games remaining in league action
To do this against this team  and again you have to understand this team beat West Virginia by 20 and they had won five of six games Coach Cal said So they had been playing well But this was good for us good win
