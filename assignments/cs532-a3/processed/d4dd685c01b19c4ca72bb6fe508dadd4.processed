Is it really time for the big football game already Where is 2016 going already One of things I miss from living in Indiana is our old football playoff and Super Bowl parties Some of the old Dugan Crew would all come over to the house and we would eat watch football maybe drink a little eat some more maybe drink a little more and watch a little more football It was a blast We all used to get together and go out for wings about once a month or so too That is how I discovered my deep obsession for buffalo wings I LOVE them They are probably my alltime favorite food ever As we all know wings and football go handinhand together

So what if you could make your own boneless wings right at home Trust me it can be done I love making my Buffalo Chicken Bites They are baked which takes away the intimidation of frying in hot oil and grease and they dont need a bunch of extra flour or eggs to coat them They are so EASY Did I mention the Buffalo Chicken Bites are DELICIOUS
You can also omit the buffalo sauce and leave them naked with only the breading and eat them as baked chicken nuggets which would be great for the kiddos and adultkiddos You can also just dip them in buffalo sauce and that would be great too
Ingredients
1lb ground chicken
 tsp salt
 tsp ground black pepper
 tsp garlic powder
 cup breadcrumbs
 cup panko breadcrumbs
Pinch of salt ground pepper and garlic powder
1 cup of your favorite buffalo wing sauce
Celery to serve on the side
Ranch or Bleu Cheese Dressing for serving and extra dipping
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit

Combine the ground chicken with the  tsp salt ground black pepper and garlic powder in a bowl Mix well


Form the seasoned ground chicken into chicken nuggetform I scoop some out with a tablespoon measuring spoon so they come out the same size and they have the same cooking time


In a small bowl combine the breadcrumbs panko breadcrumbs pinches of salt ground black pepper and garlic powder


Coat each chicken nugget with the breadcrumb mixture The ground chicken is sticky enough on its own to not need any extra egg or flour


Place on a oven safe baking rack on a baking sheet Bake on 425 degrees Fahrenheit for about 1520 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through Cooking times may vary Allow the chicken bites to cool long enough to handle them safely


Pour the buffalo sauce into a shallow bowl


Using tongs dip each chicken nugget into the buffalo sauce to coat


Serve the Buffalo Chicken Bites immediately with celery and ranch dressing or bleu cheese dressing on the side If you aren8217t eating the chicken right away hold off on dipping them in the buffalo sauce so they don8217t become soggy You can keep the warm in a 200 degree Fahrenheit oven
