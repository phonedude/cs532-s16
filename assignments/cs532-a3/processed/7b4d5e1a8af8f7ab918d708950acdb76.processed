Peter Miller is a lawyer and consultant in the communications industry who has previously held senior executive positions with the Canadian Association of Broadcasters CHUM Ltd and SVoxOn Sunday millions of Canadians will engage in a peculiarly Canadian ritual for the last time We will sit down to watch the Super Bowl and complain about American ads being replaced by Canadian ones






Buzzworthy American Super Bowl ads coming to Canada next year The Globe and Mail


You know the ads for companies such as Canadian Tire and Tim Hortons  the ones that help Canadian businesses employ thousands of CanadiansThe good news for those of us who complain  and seemingly dont have access to the Internet where a YouTube microsite makes the US ads available before the game even begins  is that if a Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission decision withstands a recent court challenge this will be the last time well have to watch those Canadian adsSuper Bowl 50 played between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers will be broadcast live on CBS The games Canadian rights are owned by Bell Media The show will air on CTV and RDSIn its decision last year the CRTC ruled that Bells right to replace US ads with Canadian ones on this particular show  a practice known as simultaneous substitution or simsub  will cease in 2017 No other shows are affected The basis for the decision is that nearly 100 of the nine million Canadian viewers complained about the practiceIf trends continue more Canadians will watch the Super Bowl than Americans on a per capita basis The National Football Leagues title game has become more popular in Canada than the Grey Cup The NFL fully endorses and has intervened in Canadian courts to support Bells right to replace US ads with Canadian ones to maximize ad revenue The CRTCs mandate is to safeguard enrich and strengthen the cultural political social and economic fabric of Canada and yet it proposes on the basis of a few complaints to do the oppositeHow is it that Canadians can be so interested in a game from a foreign country in a league that has no Canadian teams and features two teams from cities the vast majority of us will never visit And why does it matter whether the game features Canadian adsThese are the kinds of questions that define Canadian broadcasting We respect our neighbours to the south but we dont want to be them So how do we square that circle in a broadcast context It does not appear to fit with a regime of government requirements and incentives that allow Canadian companies to monetize foreign content and in return create Canadian jobs and Canadian content Canadian content includes news thats vital to our democracy information that keeps us connected to our physical and virtual communities and entertainment that while often taking a back seat to US fare also helps define who we are While by no means the only medium Canadians use television remains one of the most influentialMore than half a century ago Canada made a conscious decision to create a Canadianowned and controlled broadcast sector Without regulatory intervention we were on the path to a branchplant Canadian broadcast economy broadcast radio and television stations as owned and controlled affiliates of the likes of CBS and NBC Some jobs here but most of the product originating there and profits going thereWe chose a different path and we have that same choice todayAs the CRTCs current hearings on local TV have brought to the fore local media are under serious threat in Canada not due to lack of consumption but a shift in the platforms we use to consume them  and an even more massive shift in who is monetizing it and howInternet advertising now takes onethird of all advertising in Canada Internet advertising is bigger than any other advertising category  bigger than radio bigger than print and TV And 80 to 90 per cent of those Internet revenues go to Canadian branch plants of American conglomerates  Google Facebook YouTube Twitter and the likeThats just the advertising dollars It doesnt include subscriptionbased services such as Netflix or crossborder shopping on Amazon and eBay While some of these companies contribute to the Canadian economy with infrastructure jobs and taxes others maintain no infrastrastructure here and employ no Canadians but lawyers and lobbyists They refuse to provide the most basic of information requested by government agencies and pay no Canadian taxesThe issue is not whether Canadians should be able to access foreign platforms and content but whether that access should support Canadian jobs and content  or undermine themThere is nothing inherent in Internet technology that precludes Canada from having a vibrant media sector that provides maximum choice at the lowest costIt took enormous political will and countless policy leaders of tremendous ingenuity to create the Canadian broadcasting system and seed its spectacular growth through periods of constant change until only a couple of years ago It will take no less political will and ingenuity to ensure that it serves Canadians equally well in futureThat work has to start somewhere Reversing the CRTCs decision on simulcast might not appear terribly significant in the grand scheme of things but it would be a good a place to start
