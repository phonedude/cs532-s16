activity can convert inorganic Hg into its most toxicform methylmercury MeHg Benoit et al 2003 where it israpidly incorporated into the food web and biomagnifies fromone trophic level to the next Ochoaacuna et al 2002Atmospheric mercury concentrations are increasing globally duein large part to anthropogenic releases such as industrial emissions waste incinerators and coalfired power plants Pirroneet al 2010 As a result of global transport paired with localizedMeHg production even isolated ecosystems can contain elevatedHg concentrations in resident biota Landers et al 2008 In Alaskaatmospheric deposition of Hg is attributed to longrange transportassociated in part with largescale increases in coal combustionand expanding industry in several developing countries AMAP2002 Additionally the proportionally faster warming temperatures in Arctic regions may further exacerbate Hg exposure innorthern latitudes by both releasing snowpack and permafrostentrained Hg and by enhancing conditions that facilitate MeHgproduction AMAP 2002Several studies in the Aleutian archipelago hereafter Aleutians a remote 1900 km island chain that extends westward fromthe tip of the

then composited together for each bird and homogenized to a fine powder in acryogenic grinding mill Following Environmental ProtectionAgency method 7473 EPA 2000 we measured THg concentrations in each

could benefit from studies focusedon molt patterns and differences in diet during the breeding andnonbreeding seasonSources of Hg contamination in remote regions are difficult toidentify and monitor but understanding differences in effectswithin local food webs helps to elucidate patterns of exposureand provides insight into how to monitor future trends Projectionsof climate models indicate that upper latitude regions such as theAleutian archipelago will be disproportionately impacted by climate change AMAP 2011 with a general trend toward warmerand wetter weather patterns conditions which would enhanceHg deposition through precipitation Lin and Pehkonen 1999and an increase in MeHg production associated with warmer temperatures Data from the present study serve as a reference point

concentrations in wholebodied stickleback were measured at twoweek intervals from two sites in each of two lakes from June 1 to August 10 2011 during the time period when lakes were icefree Across all sites and sampling events stickleback Hg concentrations ranged from 037107 gg dry weight dw with a mean  SE of 055001 gg dw Mean fish Hg concentrations declined by 9 during the study period from 057001 gg dw in early June to 052001 gg dw in midAugust Mean fish Hg concentrations were 6 higher in Loon Lake 056001 gg dw than in Lake 696 053001 gg dw and 4 higher in males 056001 gg dw than in females 054001 gg dw Loon Lake was distinguished from Lake 696 by the presence of piscivorous waterbirds during the breeding season Mercury concentrations in stickleback from Agattu Island were higher than would be expected for an area without known point sources of Hg pollution and high enough to be of concern to the health of piscivorous wildlife          Fulltext   middot Article middot Jul 2014
