                            Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders appeared on a debate stage for the last time before New Hampshire voters head to the polls  and after a tense week that featured escalating barbs and questions about progressive purity Here are the most memorable moments from the MSNBC debate
1 A very artful smearIn one of her most energetic salvos of the campaign Clinton ripped Sanders for attacks and insinuation suggesting that anyone who takes campaign contributions has been boughtStory Continued Below

    
        
        



 If youve got something to say say it directly but you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation I ever received and I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my ability she said calling on Sanders to end a very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out
An incredulous Sanders shaking his head attempted to respond but Clinton continued talking over him
2 Clinton quot100 percent confidentquot emails wont drag her downPressed by moderators about the steady email controversy thats raised trust issues among voters Clinton delivered a forceful rejection of concerns it would undermine her candidacy should she become the Democratic nominee
quotThis is an absurdity I think the American people will know its an absurdityquot she said suggesting that Republican secretaries of state had senior staffers who used private email addresses quotI have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever
Clinton used the opportunity to slam the process of quotretroactive classificationquot of emails as a target for reform quotThis just beggars the imaginationquot she said
3 quotNot the biggest dealquotAsked about the razorclose Iowa caucus Monday Sanders shrugged off the narrow lead for Clinton quotYou have 22 delegates I have 20 delegatesquot he said quotWe need 2500 delegates to win the nomination so this is not the biggest deal in the worldquot
He said he agrees with a Des Moines Register editorial calling for a review of the caucus process and a full audit of Mondays results But he said it wouldnt do more than show minor shifts
Clinton too shrugged off the results though she raced to declare victory Monday when the results were still unclear
quotWhatever they decide to do thats finequot she said

4 Sanders makes pitch to African Americans on FlintSanders and Clinton largely agreed that urgent and overwhelming action must be taken to fix the crisis of contaminated water in Flint Mich But Sanders harnessed the issue to hone his pitch to African Americans who have largely overlooked his candidacy and favored Clinton despite his repeated overtures
Sanders said he wondered whether if Flint were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been
Flint Michigan is a poor community it is disproportionately African American and minority and what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable he said
5 Debating the death penaltyIt was a genuine distinction Clinton outlined her support for the death penalty arguing that it should be allowed in extremely rare circumstances but only if a state meets quotthe highest standards of evidentiary proofquot She cited the Oklahoma City bombing as an example of a crime heinous enough to warrant the death penalty
Sanders argued that the death penalty had often been applied to innocent people and despite quotbarbaric acts out therequot he doesnt believe in the death penalty quotIn a world of so much violence I just dont believe that government itself should be part of the killingquot He said quotSo when somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that weve seen you lock em up and you toss away the keyquot
6 The business model of Wall StreetAfter Clinton decried Sanders focus on quotone streetquot  meaning Wall Street  Sanders delivered one of his most direct assaults on the financial industry
quotIn my view the business model of Wall Street is fraudquot he said quotI believe that corruption is rampant and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multibillion dollar settlements with the Untied States government when we have a weak regulatory system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once if we dont start breaking them up were going to have to bail them out againquot
7 Progressives and progressWhen moderator Rachel Maddow recited a litany of Clintons positions that dont necessarily align with the Democratic Party base Clinton was ready with a quip that epitomizes her case against Sanders
A progressive is someone who makes progress she said
Clinton said Sanders definition of progressive would exclude President Barack Obama Vice President Joe Biden New Hampshire Sen Jean Shaheen and the late Minnesota Sen Paul Wellstone She also argued that Sanders votes against the gun control bill undermines his own credentials
In your definition as you being the selfproclaimed gatekeeper of progressivism I dont know anyone who fits that definition
8 Clinton plays the Vermont cardAfter Sanders mounted a lengthy defense of his Democratic credentials  hes been unaffiliated with the party for most of his political career  Clinton went for the jugular noting that many of Sanders Democratic colleagues in Vermont had endorsed her campaign
Former Gov Howard Dean whos with us tonight she said so many elected Vermonters Two former governors the current governor the current other senator  I really appreciate that
Sanders replied by including all of them as part of the establishment along with other governors and elected officials
She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind them he said Thats a fact I dont deny it
9 Take two on speaking feesClinton stepped in it Wednesday night when she was asked about collecting 675000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs after leaving the State Department explaining it by saying quotthats what they offeredquot
Asked about her comment Clinton tried again
quotI think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my recordquot she said noting that many prominent leaders routinely go on the speaking circuit quotThey wanted me to talk about the world what my experience had been as secretary of statequot
Clinton said her record is more significant arguing that she predicted the mortgage crisis proposed changes in CEO compensation and called for the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
10 War in IraqWhen Sanders reiterated his wellworn criticism of Clinton for her decision to authorize the 2003 war in Iraq Clinton was ready with a rebuttal
A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS We have to look at the threats that we face right now she said
11 Clinton Sanders will be my first call if Im the nomineeAsked whether shed considering Sanders as her vice president Clinton demurred saying it would be presumptuous But she went on noting that if shes the nominee shell work immediately to unite the Democratic Party behind her
quotThe first person I will call  will be Senator Sandersquot she said
