            Pretending the crash had anything to do with GlassSteagall is Rand Paul loopy no matter where you stand on breaking up big banks

            Actually it did have something to do with it  It was instituted to prevent a massive stock market crash and it worked well up until the time it was repealed  And then we had the meltdown

        

    
    
        
            
                DoILookAmused2u 
            
        
        
            Nope Commodities Modernization Act was the culprit Not one investment bank involved was involved in retail banking until the big banks took them on as bank holding companies after the crash
This makes me think he needs a clue

            I thought GlassSteagall prohibited that mixing some other time 8212 wanna watch this thang

        

    
    
        
            
                DoILookAmused2u 
            
        
        
            It prohibited retail banks from doing what investment banks do
Post crash they technically do both due to the retail banks8217 private part of the bailout

            All partly  right But the Tritiumdeuterium booster that sent it thermonuclear was 8216insurance8217 in the form of CDS8217s that could be sold to those who had no interest in the underlying security8211creating a synthetic 8216short8217 instrument which created trillions of entirely artificial liabilities when called The way you set off this device was to mount a short attack against the underlying assets lighting off the CDS8217s which then created a feedback loop kicking off margin calls against leveraged long positions lighting off more CDS8217s rendering the writing institution insolvent8211which you then short8211and you have the crash of 2008
In essence this mechanism allowed you to take out insurance on your neighbors8217 house which you could then collect by burning it down

        

    
    
        
            
                MilwaukeeKent
            
        
        
            Definitely a tilting factor especially when they insured the same stuff over and over again no one seemed to have the actual paper since it was trading so fast electronically I knew we were in trouble in 821704 when our mortgage suddenly belonged to some other company than the one we signed papers with

        

    
    
        
            
                CripesAmighty
            
        
        
            Yeah But unbeknownst to you multiple people could take out swaps against your mortgage or the CDO in which it was bundled so their interest was for you to go bellyup

        

    
    
        
            
                MilwaukeeKent
            
        
        
            That was a screwed up sentence on my part We were fine plenty others weren8217t Should have put it 8220I knew the country8221 or 8220the economy8221 was in trouble

        

    
    
        
            
                CripesAmighty
            
        
        
            Either way you were right

        

    
    
        
            
                DoILookAmused2u 
            
        
        
            Default swaps were just one unregulated derivative CDOs and CDSs and wraps etc were mighty important There was 15 trillion in paper nobody wanted to buy or hold Not all of it worthless but that is the nature of fire sales and bank runs

        

    
    
        
            
                CripesAmighty
            
        
        
            CDOs were just bundles of debt instruments problem was crap buried in with IG paper What made It explosive were synthetic CDOs composed entirely of derivatives and wraps that were untethered from the underlying securities multiplying the liabilities created by their failure exponentially But yah CDS8217s were only part of the problem but they were the multiplier that turned 8216Little Boy8217 into 8216Castle Bravo8217

        

    
    
        
            
                DoILookAmused2u 
            
        
        
            Well I don8217t know about that  They certainly did in AIG and anybody who was fooling themselves that they were managing their risk by buying them  The whole derivative market however was rife with problems like overleveraging little or no cash to back up instruments and so on  Even now margin accounts require only 3 but there is a central clearing house so the total exposure of a given firm can be determined by the Fed post DoddFrank

        

    
    
        
            
                CripesAmighty
            
        
        
            Yeah They did in AIG and pulled down direct and leveraged positions in AIG While ostensibly for the purpose of risk management CDS8217 practical use was as a multiplier for short positions which as I described above was used as an accelerant to amplify the effectiveness of short attacks It was a great strategy which if one had enough firepower could simultaneously attack the debt and equity sides of a target8217s balance sheet

            It did allow the merger mania that helped contribute to the crash though it was by no means the primary cause

            This talk about Dodd Frank makes me sad I wish I lived in a country where Barney Frank was running for president

        

    
    
        
            
                JaaaaaCeeeee
            
        
        
            Barney Frank has gone big time and attacks Bernie as divisive holier than thou refusing to help Dems and unfairsmarmy to Hillz refraining only from calling Bernie a table leg or a threat to our economy like Goldman Sachs8217s CEO

            Well he is a tinge holier than thou Not Huckster holier than thou but a smidge

        

    
    
        
            
                JaaaaaCeeeee
            
        
        
            Not Huckster holier than thou for sure but Bernie Sanders also too trails Hillary Clinton and the entire establishment in that race

            There is a subtle sexism here As so often happens to women in leadership roles she has to play by the rules to even get in the game and then when she does so it8217s a black mark against her
If Bernie thinks that money is buying her votes he should quit with the vague innuendo and lay out specifics

            I am not going to watch this debate  I will vote for Bernie in the primary and if I have to I8217ll vote for Hillary in the general election  She is not now and never has been my idea of the ideal human being but since this is my umpteenth election I have learned to accept  I8217m with Jimmy Carter give me a Dem but if I have to go Repub give me Trump over Cruz

            I married a much older guy and it was great for decades and it8217s still pretty good but he is OLD now and I don8217t think a president should be as old as Bernie would be in five years because of my experience with a very smart and physically fit guy who is alreadyt that old There I said it

            I did the same as you I would not want my hubby to be presidenting not for his age but because he would be an insufferable jerk when arguing probably Oh yeah Well I am PRESIDENT so I really do know better so there
But Bernie is young at heart and head and Hillz really ain8217t a heck of a lot younger

            Just fine I don8217t get why Sanders fans are gloating about him winning a zerodiversity state in his backyard by the margin that was obvious six months ago It8217s the remaining states that he has a problem with because he hasn8217t bothered to try to appeal to any minorities even though that was clearly what he needed to do That8217s why 82 of African Americans are going to vote for Hillary and that8217s why 8211 until he actually starts talking about racism as something other than an economic issue which he doesn8217t seem to want to do 8211 Sanders still can8217t win

            To be honest Hillz has more to lose The 8220consensus8221 from whom ever they are seem to indicate that the presidency is her8217s to lose Bernie is gaining and might become seriously electable in the upcoming months

            Not that electable at the moment According to the last PPP poll she8217s got an almost insurmountable lead with minorities particularly AfricanAmericans 8211 828 and he8217s just not making any headway there That can change of course but really he should have done something about it already That basically means that at the moment he can only win in states with a large white majority and even then he didn8217t win Iowa

            You8217re confusing 8220nominatable8221 with 8220electable8221  I think Bernie could whip any of the GOP candidates in a general election but it8217s always going to be much more certain with Hillary  Bernie has to convince the Dems that he8217s not this century8217s George McGovern

            Well the stream is over and done That8217s how reasonable people with very different views conduct themselves in a debate or discussion about the issues I wonder what the RNC strategists make of all this So there8217s way to many Werther8217s left and appropriate libation to douse them in I think it should all be saved for the next Rethuglican 8220debate8221
The up side of the stream ending is I don8217t feel inclined to watch Tweety8217s breakdown

            I have been considering this and I have decided that a wingnut friends always bring it up first and if you do not agree there is something wrong with you and b wingnuts are usually quicker to write people off while liberals try to be polite when it comes to politics

            It is possible that we could ditch that Biblical word 8220sodomy8221 and replace it with something more 21st century and lacking in JudaeoChristian imagery  For example what the Bible calls 8220witchcraft8221 is now referred to as 8220Wicca8221 or 8220The Craft8221  Anyone have any polite suggestions

                Mr Corrections
            
        
        
            I read a psychology study recently that concluded that 100 of homophobes were repressed homosexuals Not just most of them but ALL of them
That8217s why you write things like this 8220one man violently ramming his throbbing member into another man8217s rectm  and slamming it against his prostate while screaming loudly in ecstasy and releasing gallons of sticky greasy splooge deep inside8221
I hope one day you come to terms with your sexuality
