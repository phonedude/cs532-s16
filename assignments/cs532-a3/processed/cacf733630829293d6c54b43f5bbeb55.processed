JustificationThis species has not been recorded since the type specimen was collected in 1866 and it was not found during recent surveys since 1998 Very little forest remains and habitat destruction has been extensive and is continuing However it cannot be assumed to be Extinct because there have been some local reports a thorough survey is required and some Asian scopsowls survive even in secondary habitats Any remaining population is likely to be tiny and for these reasons it is treated as Critically Endangered

Taxonomic noteOtus magicus and O tempestatis del Hoyo and Collar 2014 were previously lumped as O magicus  and O alfredi  O siaoensis  O enganensis  O insularis and O beccarii del Hoyo and Collar 2014 were split from O magicus following Widodo et al 1999  Lambert and Rasmussen 1998  Andrew 1992 and Holt et al 1999 Prior to that all these taxa were lumped in O magicus following Sibley and Monroe 1990  1993 
Identification17160cm Small forestdwelling owl Typical scopsowl with relatively large head and feet very finely barred wings and tail Similar spp The only scopsowl on Siau Voice Undocumented Taxonomy Previously considered conspecific with Moluccan Scopsowl O magicus recent research has shown it to be a valid species on the basis of morphological features 



Distribution and populationOtus siaoensis is only known from the holotype collected on the island of Siau north of Sulawesi Indonesia in 1866 Given the small size of this island and its generally unvegetated volcanic upper reaches the original population was probably always modest in size and any surviving population must be tiny given that little forest remains There is some suggestion that the species might survive on the basis of accounts given by local people however a recent survey of nocturnal birds in northern Sulawesi spent 32 days on Siau Island and failed to confirm that the species still occurs there However semistructured interviews revealed that small owls do occur on the island and one unidentified call was heard These reports remain unconfirmed Hunowi 2006 but a recent sound recording is thought to relate to this species and further searches are planned N Brickle in litt 2007 2008 2012 Several further searches in 2009 failed to locate the species and the origin of an owllike call recorded in several forest fragments remain uncertain Sykes 2009 Population justificationThe population is estimated to number fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals based on analyses of recent searches and reports the extent of habitat destruction within its range and the conclusion that it seems likely that any surviving population will prove minuteTrend justificationThe population is suspected to be stable in the absence of evidence for any declines or substantial threatsEcologyThere are no ecological data although it is reasonable to assume that the species is a forest dweller in common with its close congeners A call thought to relate to this species has been heard in degraded forest on steep slopes N Brickle in litt 2012ThreatsSiau is currently experiencing rapid deforestation In 1995 there was some lowland forest around Lake Kepetta in the south of the island but this had been felled by 1998 In August 1998 the island was judged to have been largely converted to mixed plantation and scrub but small patches of low trees survived In October 1998 a fiveday survey determined that only 50 ha of forest remained all above 800 m on Gunung Tamata in the centre of the islandConservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II In October 1998 five days were spent on the island of Tagulandang just south of and almost as large as Siau but only a few hectares of forest were found to remain all above 600 m The Wildlife Conservation Society is providing financial and technical support to the North Sulawesi local NGO PALS to conduct extensive surveys of Siau Island to locate the species If found immediate conservation measures will be implemented N Brickle in litt 2007 2008 Conservation Actions ProposedSurvey the remaining forest on Siau and Tagulandang at different times of year investigating any patch of trees however remote the possibility of success may seem In the event of its survival initiate conservation measures at the site of rediscovery
