                You dont need to see Concussion to understand the dangers inherent in contact sports Research increasingly connects sportsrelated head injuries to chronic brain issues like light sensitivity depression and anxiety Yet despite awareness and huge leaps in material science todays helmets are hardly different from the helmets Jim Brown and Johnny Unitas wore 50 years ago
                VICIS a tech company that spun out of the CoMotion incubation lab at the University of Washington is working to tackle this challenge with the ZERO1 a 21st century football helmet that is safer sexier and more functional 
                At the core of VICIS innovation is the concept of local deformation Designed to absorb the impact of a collision the outer layers of the helmet slow acceleration and protect precious cargo the brain
              
            
            
              
                Similar concepts may sound familiar as they have been in use for years in the automotive industry Borrowing from these industries and leveraging scientific principles to address the issue of concussions specifically VICIS revolutionary ZERO1 helmet is designed to reduce the risk of head injury for football players
                VICIS recognized early on that superior technology alone does not guarantee a success and reached out to Artefact to design a helmet that is as functional as it is iconic We embraced the opportunity to collaborate on the design of the ZERO1 a helmet poised to improve player safety while increasing comfort and performance
    
    To accelerate your own innovation efforts join the beta of Project Helium the tool we are building to help teams get from ideas to decisions faster and with more confidence
              
            
 
            
           


          
            
              
                 
                  Artefact understood the critically important need to merge safety form and function into the design of our new helmet When we review our helmet designs with current and former NFL and NCAA players they are consistently impressed by the look and the feel of the ZERO1

    Trusted Sleek Bold Iconic
  

      
          
            
              
                In elitelevel sports the demands and requirements placed on equipment are extreme making the job of designing a helmet a very complex one We spent time with players and coaches equipment managers trainers and medical staff and learned to appreciate the complexity of diverse requirements and priorities
                We considered both the functional and human factors as well as the emotional needs of the players to deliver a design that reflected the ultimate equation of our research findings achieving Performance through a balanced mix of Safety Style and Comfort
              
            
            
              
                Professional football players are acutely aware of their personal brand The design of the VICIS ZERO1 inspires confidence balances style and function expresses strength and personality and stands out as unique and recognizable
                The ZERO1 is a reflection not only of the values of the VICIS brand but of the game itself  classic bold and unforgettable
              
            


    
      
    


  
    Balancing comfort safety and style for ultimate performance
  

      
          
            
              
                A helmet needs be comfortable and trustworthy allowing the player to focus exclusively on running their next route or making their next tackle During a game the helmet must be easy for equipment managers to adjust and quick to repair In case of suspected injury it must be quick and easy to remove the facemask and helmet It can never get in the way of a player being on the field 
              
            
            
              
                From the chinstrap to the facemask the comfort liner to the occipital support  every part of the football helmet needs to meet the specific and often divergent requirements of players and equipment managers Our goal was to develop a design modern yet classic highlighting the innovation of VICIS technology while leveraging the components that have historically proven to work We emphasized the essential over ornamental

              Deformable outer shell
              The VICIS LODE Shell absorbs impact load by locally deforming like a car bumper Automotive safety engineers have used local deformation to protect people for decades VICIS is the first to bring this proven innovation to football helmets

            
           
          

          
            
              
            
            
              Unique chin strap attachment
              By designing the chin strap to be attached from the deformable outside shell and the hardplastic ARCH Shell we were able to provide a better fit and improve player safety and visibility
            
            
            
          

          
            
              
            
            
              Removable internal cushioning and personalization 
              Comfort cleanability and personalization were key design criteria for the inner shell structure The unique lowprofile internal cushion can be customized to ensure the best fit It can also be removed for easy cleaning and parts replacement
            
            
          

          
            
              
            
            
              A design evolution that envelops a technical revolution
              We wanted to celebrate the unique technology and make it into a recognizable and unique component of the ZERO1 identity from the venting components and through the signature crown design
            
            

    


            
              Why BrakePack matters
            
          
        
          
                At a time when we are trying to come up with new devices for our wrists and eyes we designed BrakePack as a backpack first one that also happens to bring wellexecuted and meaningful technology along for the ride And that is what great design is all about  not only merging aesthetics and functionality but leading towards preferable outcomes In the case of BrakePack these outcomes could be a cyclists life saved an accident averted

              Football Field Research
              Maintenance and reconditioning style and comfort easy removability  these are just a few of the attributes that equipment managers players and medical staff consider for any piece of equipment they deploy
            
            
              
              Technology Exploration
              We explored the technology structures assembly and helmet details highlighting the elements that were prime target for innovation and differentiation
            
            
              
              Concept Design and Evaluation
              We explored multiple distinct assembly schemes zeroing in on our final design based on the set of evaluation criteria that were set early in the exploration phase 
            
            
              
              Player Feedback and Refinement
              Throughout the design process we had the opportunity to meet discuss and gather feedback from players at the highest levels of the game We refined each and every detail to deliver a product that respects football legacy while offering a true revolution in protection and comfort
