Bowl XLIX was the mostwatched broadcast in US television history with 1144 million people tuning in But here are three global sporting events that top the NFLs championship game Jason AldagIshaan TharoorThe Washington Post   Last years Super Bowl XLIX was the most watched eventin US televisionhistory as 1144 million people tuned in to seethe New England Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks A similar number of viewers are expected for this years big game Yet while the Super Bowl may be the supreme spectacle on the American calendar in terms of viewers it barely holds a candle to these other recent sporting events as we see in the video above   Super Bowl 50 by the numbers 49 facts and figures to know   Soccer the preeminent global game commands huge TV numbers The final of last years UEFA Champions League  a tournament involving Europes top soccer clubs  was watched by an audience of more than 180 million The World Cup final in Rio de Janeiroin 2014 involved a combined in and outofhome audience of over a billion viewers The tournament as a whole was watched by some 3 billion people But perhaps more worthy of note was the match in last years Cricket World Cup between India and Pakistan The traditional rivals do not often meet in the sporting arena and so the game even though it was only in the early stages of the tournament attracteda huge audience in South Asia The BBC estimated that more than 1 billion people watched Indias eventual victory over Pakistan in the Australian city of Adelaide More than 288 million people watched in India alone   Ishaan Tharoor
