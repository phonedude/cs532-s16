        William  Mary played important role in Sean McDermotts NFL successBy Ryan Wilson  CBSSportscom

        SAN JOSE Calif  Before Sean McDermott was one of the NFLs best young defensive coordinators mentioned as a possible headcoaching candidate he was a walkon at William amp Mary a Division IAA program in Williamsburg Va By his senior season McDermott was team captain an allconference safety and a member of the Atlantic 10 allacademic teamSeventeen years later hes the man responsible the Panthers dominant defense which ranks second in the league behind only the Broncos according to Football Outsiders metrics A lot of what McDermott experienced at William amp Mary has shaped him into the coach he is todayThe latest from SportsLineSuper Bowl 50 Our 20 favorite prop playsThose were obviously great experiences he told CBSSportscom this week I knew I wanted to coach at an early age My father was a college and high school coach and I just love being around the game Thats kind of how I was as a player and I ended up coaching the spring of my fifth year when coach Jimmye Laycock approached me and asked if I wanted to give it a try And Im grateful for it  that was my startI think its no accident that a number of coaches and personnel guys have come out of William and Mary To me its a credit to the type of program coach Laycock runs There are set rules there is clarity when it comes to expectations Youre expected to go to class and be a studentathlete There are no cutting cornersMcDermott was a true freshman in 1993 and played on the same team with current Steelers coach Mike Tomlin Tomlin a 6foot2 wide receiver finished his William amp Mary career with 101 receptions for 2046 yards and a schoolbest 20 touchdowns His 202 yardspercatch average in 1994 was also a school recordWe asked McDermott about Tomlins gameHe wasnt a fast wide receiver but he was a long strider Id compare him to Devin Funchess  he has that length and was willing to go over the middle to make the great catches he said But what I remember the most about Mike was that he was a leaderBut perhaps the best player on those teams was quarterback Shawn Knight a 5foot10 175pound dynamo who could do everything In 1993 he completed 125 of 177 passes 040706 percent041 for 2055 yards 22 touchdowns and four interceptions In fact if Knight was a few inches taller he almost certainly would have been a highround pickNo question McDermott said I told my wife the other night  shes a Delaware grad  that I remember a play against Delaware where it was a quarterback sneak in a shortyard situation Shawn jumped over the pile got pushed back and never really got tackled He came off the pile spun off around the corner and disappeared around the end for a 30 or 40yard gain just because he was an incredible athlete  Sean McDermotts defense is one of the NFLs best 040USATSI041 Back in 2014 Laycock told the VirginianPilot I can remember many times at practice with Shawn that the ball would never touch the ground He was always so accurate  as accurate as any quarterback Ive ever seen in practice and then that obviously carries over into gamesAs a junior Knight also began playing baseball and a year later he was drafted in the 13th round by the San Diego Padres He had a brief stint in the CFL but the NFL never came calling In retrospect that wasnt because Knight wasnt ready for the NFL but that the NFL wasnt ready for KnightI would say hes like Russell Wilson said McDermott comparing Knight to one of the leagues most athletic quarterbacks Smaller guy nimble got that cannon for an arm fast Shawn was special  Back in the day I was really honestly in awe of Shawn not only because of his athleticism but because of who he was and the way he handled things on and off the field He was a true professionalIts the culmination of those relationships and experiences that have led McDermott to this point one game away from a Super Bowl titleTo me when you look back at our team and I think about the great teams Ive been on they all had that special chemistry thats built up through highcharacter individuals that just love being around one another he said And I would say the same thing about this football team here in front of us
