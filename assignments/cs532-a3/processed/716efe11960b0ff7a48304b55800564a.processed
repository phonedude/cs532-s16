    Why the Panthers will win The 
    Panthers run out to an early start and cruise behind a ballhawking defense that makes life miserable for 
    Peyton Manning in his final game 
     
     
    MVP 
    Luke Kuechly 
     
     
    Bold prediction 
    Jonathan Stewart rushes for 150 yards due to the special attention the 
    Broncos pay to 
    Cam Newton The 
    Panthers wear out the 
    Broncos with a variety of zoneread plays that allow Stewart to crease the defense down the middle on the way to a spectacular performance

    Why the Panthers will win Carolina will move the ball early but Denvers defense will force field goals instead of touchdowns keeping 
    Peyton Manning in the game In the end however 
    Cam Newton will engineer the gamewinning drive 
     
     
    MVP 
    Cam Newton 
     
     
    Bold prediction The

    Why the Panthers will win Id like Peyton to win his second championship but I think 
    Cam Newton and Co are too good right now They are proving everybody wrong Matchupwise Carolinas defense has the upper hand against the 
    Broncos offense and Peyton hasnt been that hot 
     
     
    MVP 
    Luke Kuechly 
     
     
    Bold prediction Denver kicker 
    Brandon McManus is going to keep the 
    Broncos in the game making a number of clutch field goals

    Why the Panthers will win Ive gone back and forth all week about who will win this game The 
    Panthers are more of a complete team and if they get into a shootout the defense and Cam will be able to pull through and lead the 
    Panthers to victory My fear for Denver is if they get into a shootout does Peyton have enough in the tank to win the game Im not sure he does 
     
     
    MVP 
    Luke Kuechly

    Cam Newton rushes for 150 yards and throws for 350 yards

    Why the Broncos will win The 
    Broncos havent turned the ball over lately and thats key Carolina takes a lot of chances and is going against a Denver defense that has a really good front seven and a secondary that can cover As long as 
    Peyton Manning doesnt turn the ball over the 
    Broncos will win 
     
     
    MVP 
    TJ Ward 
     
     
    Bold prediction The 
    Carolina Panthers dont rush for 100 yards ending their 31game streak of doing so

    Why the Panthers will win The interior three of the 
    Panthers offensive line  
    Ryan Kalil 
    Trai Turner and 
    Andrew Norwell and their defensive line may be underrated but they carry the day for Carolina despite an excellent effort from 
    Broncos QB 
    Peyton Manning 
     
     
    MVP 
    Cam Newton 
     
     
    Bold prediction The field of Levis Stadium which 
    has been an issue in the twoyearold venues young life will shock everyone by holding up well Yes this current field 
    was recently installed just for this game but the field has been reinstalled resodded 
    reeverythinged prior to this latest  and likely most fevered  incarnation My prediction is that this one will hold up and the field will be a nonfactor despite the scrutiny given to it in pregame discussions

    Why the Broncos will win The 
    Broncos will win because of two reasons The defense particularly 
    Chris Harris Jr has been phenomenal The 
    Panthers defense will stop the run and it will all fall on the shaky yet incredible arm of 
    Peyton Manning Hes going to get it done 
     
     
    MVP 
    Von Miller 
     
     
    Bold prediction Manning will be literally carried off the field

    Why the Panthers will win Its going to be a defensive battle For me its a wash defensively the only gamechanger you cant account for is 
    Cam Newton Because hes in the 
    Super Bowl hes going to be the champion and 
    Super Bowl MVP 
     
     
    MVP 
    Cam Newton 
     
     
    Bold prediction There will be three miscellaneous touchdowns by the 
    Panthers They will score two on defense and one on special teams

    Why the Panthers will win I think this game as all games do will come down to quarterbacks and as great as 
    Peyton Manning once was the torch has been passed 
    Cam Newton simply makes big plays for Carolina and I see him making the gamewinning play in overtime perhaps in the form of a big run 
     
     
    MVP 
    Cam Newton 
     
     
    Bold prediction 
    Panthers left tackle 
    Michael Oher will help keep 
    DeMarcus Ware sackless

    Carolina Panthers 27 Denver Broncos 17 
     
     
    Why the Panthers will win The 
    Panthers offense is so hard to defend because with 
    Cam Newton and the run game there are so many different facets that its hard to simulate that for your defense They are doing so many different things that it paralyzes the defense Carolina is so physical and it reminds me of the 
    Seahawks who also beat Denver on this same stage two years ago

    Why the Panthers will win If anybody has watched the last two games for both teams I dont know how anybody could pick the 
    Broncos to win this game If both teams play equally well the 
    Broncos will lose There is always a chance they could win because of injuries defensive scores and other factors but I dont see that happening

    Carolina Panthers 27 Denver Broncos 14 
     
     
    Why the Panthers will win The 
    Panthers play with a physical mentality and are tough on both sides of the ball There are a lot of underdogs on that team because people thought they didnt have a big name starting off so they play with a chip on their shoulder The camaraderie that team has and the way 
    Cam Newton has led it feels like they are destined to win it 
     
     
    MVP 
    Cam Newton 
     
     
    Bold prediction 
    Ted Ginn Jr will have a profound impact on this game because there is hardly any attention on him
