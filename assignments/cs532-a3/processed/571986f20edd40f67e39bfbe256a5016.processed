		Having witnessed Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos at their absolute worst I like their chances of winning Super Bowl 50
 Instead of being scarred by what unfolded that afternoon in midNovember when Kansas Citys Alex Smith looked like the only quarterback worthy of playing in a Super Bowl Im encouraged about the Broncos Manning is more healthy now and Denvers defense is markedly better than the group that took the field two years ago against Seattle on this stage
The Carolina offense has not seen a defense like this said CBS analyst Phil Simms
And thats why the Broncos have a shot in a lowscoring game That defense won me over in November even in a 2913 loss to the Chiefs Manning played horribly amid injuries that should have sidelined him that day and did cause him to miss the next six games Yet even with Manning throwing four interceptions with five completions in twoplus quarters Denvers defense was not overwhelmed In building a 220 lead the Chiefs kicked five field goals

		The Broncos demonstrated that trait of toughness in the AFC championship game holding New England to 18 points So no way will the Panthers destroy this defense
 There is no weakness Simms said in a media roundtable Show me a weakness on their defense and Ill tell you youre wrong
 Theres certainly no comparison of this defense to the one the Broncos trotted out against Seattle in a 438 loss two years ago Key players including linebacker Von Miller and cornerback Chris Harris Jr were injured and the Broncos have made major upgrades at other positions since then becoming the NFLs No 1ranked defense And these guys are motivated by everything theyre hearing about what Cam Newton and the Panthers may do to them
Definitely think were getting underdogged on the defense Harris said People really truly I dont think theyve analyzed everything that weve done on defense this whole year Weve got ugly wins We grind them out
Thats a compliment and the Broncos can do it again Think about this Sundays overunder total is 45 points suggesting a score such as 2421 Could Manning and his offense produce 24 points Of course In the playoffs the Broncos have scored 23 against Pittsburgh and 20 against New England as Manning has gone interceptionfree and the offense has followed through on the defenses work
Newton will make some plays Sunday but the Broncos pass rushers will hound him as they did to New Englands Tom Brady and the Panthers will have trouble running the ball Theyll get frustrated by a defense thats not complex just effective as coordinated by Wade Phillips Broncos defensive lineman Derek Wolfe describes the scheme as See ball get ball
Wades pretty simple said Denver coach Gary Kubiak We dont do a lot of things but hes very aggressive He does a great job of putting players in position to be successful It gets them excited to play by how he moves them around
Phillips has gone from being unemployed last season to masterminding a Super Bowl defense as an assistant coach for a franchise that once fired him as a head coach Thats life in the NFL
If the Broncos win Sunday Manning will have done his part and hell have the option of retiring on top in the tradition of Denver quarterback John Elway  whos now the Broncos executive vice president of football operations responsible for bringing in all of this defensive talent If their defense dominates and wins this game Simms said its going to go down as one of the greatest ever
That will be a credit to Elway who recognized the need to stop the other guys not just outscore them And that defense will come through in the end
Newton grew up idolizing former Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair so his strongest Super Bowl memory is how former University of Utah receiver Kevin Dyson caught McNairs pass and was tackled at the 1yard line on the final play of a 2316 loss to St Louis Thats how Ive got Super Bowl 50 ending with Denvers defense deciding the outcome Broncos 24 Panthers 20
