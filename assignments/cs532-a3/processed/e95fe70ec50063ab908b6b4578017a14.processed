Tips


Thickcut smoked bacon is especially delicious but may require more cooking time
Try microwaving the bacon until cooked but not crispy Then wrap hot dog Secure bacon with toothpicks The grill em very tasty
One variation is to slit the hot dogs and stuff the inside with shredded cheese before wrapping in bacon Medium or sharp cheddar is excellent those with more exotic tastes might want to try smoked gouda or havarti with caraway Note Cheesestuffed dogs are very messy to fry in a skillet
For a slightly less fatty version wrap the hotdogs in bacon as above secure ends of bacon with toothpicks and broil in the oven on a broiling rack Turn the dogs when the top side is broiled to your liking and cook other side Take care not to let the bacon burn When fully cooked drain on paper towels remove toothpicks and serve
