Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance a large broad head binocular vision binaural hearing sharp talons and feathers adapted for silent flight Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawkowl and the gregarious burrowing owl
Owls hunt mostly small mammals insects and other birds although a few species specialize in hunting fish They are found in all regions of the Earth except Antarctica and some remote islands
Owls are divided into two families the true owls or typical owls Strigidae and the barnowls Tytonidae

Burrowing owl Athene cunicularia






Captive shorteared owl chick at about 18 days old


Owls possess large forwardfacing eyes and earholes a hawklike beak a flat face and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers a facial disc around each eye The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted in order to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls asymmetrically placed ear cavities Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads but the stereoscopic nature of the owls forwardfacing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for lowlight hunting Although owls have binocular vision their large eyes are fixed in their socketsas are those of other birdsso they must turn their entire head to change views As owls are farsighted they are unable to see clearly anything within a few centimeters of their eyes Caught prey can be felt by owls with the use of filoplumeslike feathers on the beak and feet that act as feelers Their far vision particularly in low light is exceptionally good
Owls can rotate their heads and necks as much as 270 degrees Owls have fourteen neck vertebrae compared to 7 in humans which makes their necks more flexible They also have adaptations to their circulatory systems permitting rotation without cutting off blood to the brain the foramina in their vertebrae through which the vertebral arteries pass are about 10 times the diameter of the artery instead of about the same size as the artery as in humans the vertebral arteries enter the cervical vertebrae higher than in other birds giving the vessels some slack and the carotid arteries unite in a very large anastomosis or junction the largest of any birds preventing loss of blood supply from being cut off while they rotate their necks Other anastomoses between the carotid and vertebral arteries support this effect12
The smallest owlweighing as little as 31 grams 1160oz and measuring some 135 centimetres 5160inis the elf owl Micrathene whitneyi3 Around the same diminutive length although slightly heavier are the lesser known longwhiskered owlet Xenoglaux loweryi and Tamaulipas pygmy owl Glaucidium sanchezi3 The largest owl by length is the great grey owl Strix nebulosa which measures around 70160cm 28160in on average and can attain a length of 84160cm 33160in3 However the heaviest and largest winged owls are two similarlysized eagle owls the Eurasian eagleowl Bubo bubo and Blakistons fish owl B blakistoni These two species which are on average about 253160cm 100160in shorter in length than the great grey can both attain a wingspan of 2160m 66160ft and a weight of 45160kg 10160lb in the largest females34567
Different species of owls produce different sounds this distribution of calls aids owls in finding mates or announcing their presence to potential competitors and also aids ornithologists and birders in locating these birds and distinguishing species As noted above the facial disc helps owls to funnel the sound of prey to their ears In many species these discs are placed asymmetrically for better directional location
Owl plumage is generally cryptic although several species have facial and head markings including face masks ear tufts and brightly coloured irises These markings are generally more common in species inhabiting open habitats and are thought to be used in signaling with other owls in low light conditions8
Sexual dimorphismedit
Sexual dimorphism is a physical difference between male and females of a species Reverse sexual dimorphism is when females are larger than males and it has been observed across multiple owl species9 The degree of size dimorphism varies across multiple population and species which is measured through various traits such as wing span and body mass9 Overall female owls tend to be slightly larger than males The exact explanation for this development in owls is unknown However there are several theories explaining the development of sexual dimorphism in owls
One theory suggests that selection has led males to be smaller because it allows them to be efficient foragers The ability to obtain more food is advantageous during breeding season In some species female owls stay at their nest with their eggs while it is the responsibility of the male to bring back food to the nest10 However if food is scarce the male will first feed itself before feeding the female11 Small birds which are agile are an important source of food for owls Male Burrowing owls have been observed to have longer wing chords than females despite being smaller than females11 Furthermore owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey11 This has also been observed in other predatory birds10 This suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey
Another popular theory suggests that females have not been selected to be smaller like male owls because of their sexual roles In many species female owls may not leave the nest Therefore females may have a larger mass to allow them to go without starving for a longer period of time For example one hypothesized sexual role is larger females are more capable of dismembering prey and feeding it to their young hence why female owls are larger than their male counterparts9
A different theory suggests that the size difference between male and females is due to sexual selection11 Large females can choose their mate and may reject sexual advances from males through violence11 Therefore small male owls that have the ability to escape female owls not receptive to sexual advances are more to have been selected11
Breeding and reproductionedit
Owl eggs typically have a white colour and an almost spherical shape and range in number from a few to a dozen depending on species and the particular season for most three or four is the more common number In at least one species female owls do not mate with the same male for a life time It is common for female burrowing owls to travel and find other mates while the male stays in its territory and mates with other females12
Behavioredit




The serrations on the leading edge of an owls flight feathers reduce noise






Owl eyes each have nictitating membranes that can move independently of each other as seen on this spotted eagleowl in Johannesburg South Africa






Owls yawn


Most owls are nocturnal actively hunting their prey in darkness Several types of owl however are crepuscularactive during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk one example is the pygmy owl Glaucidium A few owls are active during the day also examples are the burrowing owl Speotyto cunicularia and the shorteared owl Asio flammeus
Much of the owls hunting strategy depends on stealth and surprise Owls have at least two adaptations that aid them in achieving stealth First the dull coloration of their feathers can render them almost invisible under certain conditions Secondly serrated edges on the leading edge of owls remiges muffle an owls wing beats allowing an owls flight to be practically silent Some fisheating owls for which silence has no evolutionary advantage lack this adaptation
An owls sharp beak and powerful talons allow it to kill its prey before swallowing it whole if it is not too big Scientists studying the diets of owls are helped by their habit of regurgitating the indigestible parts of their prey such as bones scales and fur in the form of pellets These owl pellets are plentiful and easy to interpret and are often sold by companies to schools for dissection by students as a lesson in biology and ecology13
Adaptations for huntingedit
All owls are carnivorous birds of prey and live mainly on a diet of insects and small rodents such as mice rats and hares Some owls are also specifically adapted to hunt fish They are very adept in hunting in their respective environments Since owls can be found in nearly all parts of the world and across a multitude of ecosystems their hunting skills and characteristics vary slightly from species to species though most characteristics are shared among all speciescitation needed
Flight and feathersedit
Most owls share an innate ability to fly almost silently and also more slowly in comparison to other birds of prey Most owls live a mainly nocturnal lifestyle and being able to fly without making any noise gives them a strong advantage over their prey that are listening for the slightest sound in the night A silent slow flight is not as necessary for diurnal and crepuscular owls given that prey can usually see an owl approaching While the morphological and biological mechanisms of this silent flight are more or less unknown the structure of the feather has been heavily studied and accredited to a large portion of why they have this ability Owls feathers are generally larger than the average birds feathers have fewer radiates longer pennulum and achieve smooth edges with different rachis structures14 Serrated edges along the owls remiges bring the flapping of the wing down to a nearly silent mechanism Research has shown that the serrations are more likely reducing aerodynamic disturbances rather than simply reducing noise14 The surface of the flight feathers is covered with a velvety structure that absorbs the sound of the wing moving These unique structures reduce noise frequencies above 2160kHz15 making the sound level emitted drop below the typical hearing spectrum of the owls usual prey1516 and also within the owls own best hearing rangecitation needed This optimizes the owls ability to silently fly in order to capture prey without the prey hearing the owl first as it flies in It also allows the owl to monitor the sound output from its flight pattern
The feather adaption that allows silent flight means that barn owl feathers are not waterproof To retain the softness and silent flight the barn owl cannot use the preen oil or powder dust that other species use for waterproofing In wet weather they cannot hunt and this may be disastrous during the breeding season Barn owls are frequently found drowned in cattle drinking troughs since they land to drink and bathe but are unable to climb out Owls can struggle to keep warm because of their lack of waterproofing so large numbers of downy feathers help them to retain body heat17
Visionedit
Eyesight is a particular characteristic of the owl that aids in nocturnal prey capture Owls are part of a small group of birds that live nocturnally but do not use echolocation to guide them in flight in lowlight situations Owls are known for their disproportionally large eyes in comparison to their skull An apparent consequence of the evolution of an absolutely large eye in a relatively small skull is that the eye of the owl has become tubular in shape This shape is found in other socalled nocturnal eyes such as the eyes of strepsirrhine primates and bathypelagic fishes18 Since the eyes are fixed into these sclerotic tubes they are unable to move the eyes in any direction19 Instead of moving their eyes owls swivel their head to visualize their surroundings Owls heads are capable of swiveling through an angle of approximately 270 easily enabling them to see behind them without relocating the torso19 This ability keeps bodily movement at a minimum and thus reduces the amount of sound the owl makes as it waits for its prey Owls are regarded as having the most frontally placed eyes among all avian groups which gives them some of the largest binocular fields of vision However owls are farsighted and cannot focus on objects within a few centimeters of their eyes1820 While it is commonly believed that owls have great nocturnal vision due to their large and thus very lightgathering eyes and pupils andor extremely sensitive rod receptors the true cause for their ability to see in the night is due to neural mechanisms which mediate the extraction of spatial information gathered from the retinal image throughout the nocturnal luminance range These mechanisms are only able to function due to the largesized retinal image21 Thus the primary nocturnal function in the vision of the owl is due to its large posterior nodal distance retinal image brightness is only maximized to the owl within secondary neural functions21 These attributes of the owl cause its nocturnal eyesight to be far superior to that of its average prey21
Hearingedit
Owls exhibit specialized hearing functions and ear shapes that also aid in hunting They are noted for asymmetrical ear placements on the skull in some genera Owls can have either internal or external ears both of which are asymmetrical Asymmetry has not been reported to extend to the middle or internal ear of the owl Asymmetrical ear placement on the skull allows the owl to pinpoint the location of its prey This is especially true for strictly nocturnal species such as the barn owls Tyto or Tengmalms owl19 With ears set at different places on its skull an owl is able to determine the direction from which the sound is coming by the minute difference in time that it takes for the sound waves to penetrate the left and right earscitation needed The owl turns its head until the sound reaches both ears at the same time at which point it is directly facing the source of the sound This time difference between ears is a matter of about 000003 seconds or 30 millionths of a second Like the eyes which utilize feather movements to focus lightcitation neededdubious  discuss the ears are surrounded by feathers to maximize hearing capabilities Behind the ear openings there are modified dense feathers densely packed to form a facial ruff which creates an anteriorlyfacing concave wall that cups the sound into the ear structure22 This facial ruff is poorly defined in some species and prominent nearly encircling the face in other species The facial disk also acts to direct sound into the ears and a downwardfacing sharply triangular beak minimizes sound reflection away from the face The shape of the facial disk is adjustable at will to focus sounds more effectively19
It is a common misapprehension that the prominences above a great horned owls head are its ears This is not the case they are merely feather tufts The ears are on the sides of the head in the usual location in two different locations as described above
Talonsedit
While the auditory and visual capabilities of the owl allow it to locate and pursue its prey the talons and beak of the owl do the final work The owl kills its prey by using these talons to crush the skull and knead the body19 The crushing power of an owls talons varies according to prey size and type and by the size of the owl The burrowing owl Athene cunicularia a small partly insectivorous owl has a release force of only 5160N The larger barn owl Tyto alba needs a force of 30160N to release its prey and one of the largest owls the great horned owl Bubo virginianus needs a force of over 130160N to release prey in its talons23 An owls talons like those of most birds of prey can seem massive in comparison to the body size outside of flight The masked owl has some of the proportionally longest talons of any bird of prey they appear enormous in comparison to the body when fully extended to grasp prey24 An owls claws are sharp and curved The family Tytonidae have inner and central toes of about equal length while the family Strigidae have an inner toe that is distinctly shorter than the central one23 These different morphologies allow efficiency in capturing prey specific to the different environments they inhabit
Beakedit
The beak of the owl is short curved and downwardfacing and typically hooked at the tip for gripping and tearing its prey Once prey is captured the scissor motion of the top and lower bill is used to tear the tissue and kill The sharp lower edge of the upper bill works in coordination with the sharp upper edge of the lower bill to deliver this motion The downwardfacing beak allows the owls field of vision to be clear as well as directing sound into the ears without deflecting sound waves away from the facecitation needed




Snowy owl blends well with its snowy surroundings


Camouflageedit
The coloration of the owls plumage plays a key role in its ability to sit still and blend into the environment making it nearly invisible to prey Owls tend to mimic the colorations and sometimes even the texture patterns of their surroundings the common barn owl being an exception Nyctea scandiaca or the snowy owl appears nearly bleachwhite in color with a few flecks of black mimicking their snowy surroundings perfectly Likewise the mottled woodowl Strix ocellata displays shades of brown tan and black making the owl nearly invisible in the surrounding trees especially from behind Usually the only telltale sign of a perched owl will be its vocalizations or its vividly colored eyes
Evolution and systematicsedit

The systematic placement of owls is disputed For example the SibleyAhlquist taxonomy finds that based on DNADNA hybridization owls are more closely related to the nightjars and their allies Caprimulgiformes than to the diurnal predators in the order Falconiformes consequently the Caprimulgiformes are placed in the Strigiformes and the owls in general become a family Strigidae A recent study indicates that the drastic rearrangement of the genome of the accipitrids may have obscured any close relationship of theirs with groups such as the owls25 In any case the relationships of the Caprimulgiformes the owls the falcons and the accipitrid raptors are not resolved to satisfaction currently there is an increasing trend to consider each group with the possible exception of the accipitrids a distinct order
There are some 220 to 225 extant species of owls subdivided into two families typical owls Strigidae and barnowls Tytonidae Some entirely extinct families have also been erected based on fossil remains these differ much from modern owls in being less specialized or specialized in a very different way such as the terrestrial Sophiornithidae The Paleocene genera Berruornis and Ogygoptynx show that owls were already present as a distinct lineage some 6057 mya million years ago and hence possibly also some 5 million years earlier at the extinction of the nonavian dinosaurs This makes them one of the oldest known groups of nonGalloanserae landbirds The supposed Cretaceous owls Bradycneme and Heptasteornis are apparently nonavialan maniraptors26
During the Paleogene the Strigiformes radiated into ecological niches now mostly filled by other groups of birdsclarification needed The owls as we know them today on the other hand evolved their characteristic morphology and adaptations during that time too By the early Neogene the other lineages had been displaced by other bird orders leaving only barnowls and typical owls The latter at that time were usually a fairly generic type of probably earless owl similar to todays North American spotted owl or the European tawny owl the diversity in size and ecology found in typical owls today developed only subsequently
Around the PaleogeneNeogene boundary some 25 mya barnowls were the dominant group of owls in southern Europe and adjacent Asia at least the distribution of fossil and presentday owl lineages indicates that their decline is contemporary with the evolution of the different major lineages of typical owls which for the most part seems to have taken place in Eurasia In the Americas there was rather an expansion of immigrant lineages of ancestral typical owls
The supposed fossil herons Ardea perplexa Middle Miocene of Sansan France and Ardea lignitum Late Pliocene of Germany were more probably owls the latter was apparently close to the modern genus Bubo Judging from this the Late Miocene remains from France described as Ardea aureliensis should also be restudied27 The Messelasturidae some of which were initially believed to be basal Strigiformes are now generally accepted to be diurnal birds of prey showing some convergent evolution towards owls The taxa often united under Strigogyps28 were formerly placed in part with the owls specifically the Sophiornithidae they appear to be Ameghinornithidae instead293031

Symbolism and mythologyedit
Africaedit
Among the Kikuyu of Kenya it was believed that owls were harbingers of death If one saw an owl or heard its hoot someone was going to die In general owls are viewed as harbingers of bad luck ill health or death The belief is widespread even today33




The Little Owl 1506 by Albrecht Drer


The Americasedit
In most Native American folklore owls are a symbol of death Hearing owls hooting is considered the subject of numerous bogeyman stories told to warn children to remain indoors at night or not cry too much otherwise the owl may carry them away according to Seminole and Apache tribes3435 In some tribal legends owls are associated with spirits of the dead and the bony circles around an owls eyes are said to be made up of the fingernails of apparitional humans Sometimes owls are said to carry messages from beyond the grave or deliver supernatural warnings to people who have broken tribal taboos36
Pawnee tribes viewed owls as the symbol of protection from any danger within their realms Ojibwe tribes as well as their Aboriginal Canadian counterparts used an owl as a symbol for both evil and death In addition they used owls as a symbol of very high status of spiritual leaders of their spirituality Pueblo people associated owls with Skeleton Man the god of death and spirit of fertility Yakama tribes use an owl as a powerful totem Such taboos or totems often guide where and how forests and natural resources are useful with management even to this day and even with the proliferation of scientific forestry on reservations37
According to the culture of the UtoAztec tribe the Hopi taboos surround owls which are associated with sorcery and other evils The Aztecs and Maya along with other natives of Mesoamerica considered the owl a symbol of death and destruction In fact the Aztec god of death Mictlantecuhtli was often depicted with owls There is an old saying in Mexico that is still in use38 Cuando el tecolote canta el indio muere When the owl criessings the Indian dies The Popol Vuh a Mayan religious text describes owls as messengers of Xibalba the Mayan Place of Fright39 The belief that owls are messengers and harbingers of the dark powers is also found among the Hogara Winnebago of Wisconsin40 When in earlier days the Hogara committed the sin of killing enemies while they were within the sanctuary of the chiefs lodge an owl appeared and spoke to them in the voice of a human saying From now on the Hogara will have no luck This marked the beginning of the decline of their tribe41 An owl appeared to Glory of the Morning the only female chief of the Hok nation and uttered her name Soon afterwards she died4243 People often allude to the reputation of owls as bearers of supernatural danger when they tell misbehaving children the owls will get you44

The modern West generally associates owls with wisdom This link goes back at least as far as Ancient Greece where Athens noted for art and scholarship and Athena Athens patron goddess and the goddess of wisdom had the owl as a symbol45 Marija Gimbutas traces veneration of the owl as a goddess among other birds to the culture of Old Europe long predating IndoEuropean cultures46
T F ThiseltonDyer in his Folklore of Shakespeare says that from the earliest period it has been considered a bird of illomen and Pliny tells us how on one occasion even Rome itself underwent a lustration because one of them strayed into the Capitol He represents it also as a funereal bird a monster of the night the very abomination of human kind Virgil describes its deathhowl from the top of the temple by night a circumstance introduced as a precursor of Didos death Ovid too constantly speaks of this birds presence as an evil omen and indeed the same notions respecting it may be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets47 A list of omens drear in John Keats Hyperion includes the gloombirds hated screech48 Pliny the Elder reports that owls eggs were commonly used as a hangover cure49
Use as rodent controledit

Encouraging natural predators to control rodent population is a natural form of pest control along with excluding food sources for rodents Placing a nest box for owls on a property can help control rodent populations one family of hungry barn owls can consume more than 3000 rodents in a nesting season while maintaining the naturally balanced food chain50
Attacks on humansedit
Although humans and owls frequently live together in harmony there have been incidents when owls have attacked humans In January 2013 a man from Inverness Scotland suffered heavy bleeding and went into shock after being attacked by an owl which was likely a 50cm tall eagle owl51 The photographer Eric Hosking lost his left eye after attempting to photograph a tawny owl which inspired the title of his 1970 autobiography An Eye for a Bird
Conservation issuesedit
See also List of Strigiformes by population
All owls are listed in Appendix II of the international CITES treaty the Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Although owls have long been hunted a 2008 news story from Malaysia indicates that the magnitude of owl poaching may be on the rise In November 2008 TRAFFIC reported the seizure of 900 plucked and ovenready owls in Peninsular Malaysia Said Chris Shepherd Senior Programme Officer for TRAFFICs Southeast Asia office This is the first time we know of where readyprepared owls have been seized in Malaysia and it may mark the start of a new trend in wild meat from the region We will be monitoring developments closely TRAFFIC commended the Department of Wildlife and National Parks in Malaysia for the raid that exposed the huge haul of owls Included in the seizure were dead and plucked barn owls spotted wood owls crested serpent eagles barred eagles and brown wood owls as well as 7000 live lizards52
