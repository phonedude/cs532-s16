You are here Home  Appetizers  Chunky Guacamole RecipeChunky Guacamole Recipe 
August 2 2015 by Nelson Cardoso Leave a Comment Ever wonder where certain things originate These are things I sometimes wonder about While I knew guacamole was connected with Mexico I didn8217t know how far back its roots went Guacamole was actually created by the Aztecs somewhere between the 14th and 16th centuries8211ya that long ago It8217s still used in modern Mexican cuisine but it8217s become very popular in North American kitchens as well8211typically used as a dip or condimenttype of topping
Today Nelson made his guacamole recipe to use as both a dip for nachos and as a condiment in our fajita dinner This guacamole is the chunky type with pieces of avocado tomato and onions
While Nelson loves a good chunky guacamole and his recipe is really really good I have to say I8217d never really tried more than a tiny dip with a nacho chip but today was different You see when Nelson and I started this blog I said I wouldn8217t write about anything I didn8217t eat and I always said I8217d be honest So there it is8230today I gave it an honest try and I liked it It still isn8217t my favourite condiment but I did surprise Nelson when I went for a second spoonful to add into my fajita What8217s happening to me I think this blog is changing me8211I8217m becoming one of those people8211you know8211a normal person who isn8217t afraid to try a variety of food I used to always say 8220no thanks8221 and pass on any food I was afraid to try based on appearance or texture but look at me now If my mom reads this she8217ll be like what All those years of me trying to get you to eat and it took this blog and Nelson8217s cooking
A couple of things to remember are 1 avocado browns quickly so you8217ll want to be sure to add lime early to stop it from turning brown and 2 place plastic wrap on the guacamole actually touching it so it8217s not exposed to air and keep it in the fridge until you8217re ready to serve it
So here8217s my challenge to anyone like me Liz not Nelson8230if you8217ve always wondered what all the hype was about guacamole but were hesitant I say give this one a try
To remove the pit cut the avocado lengthwise all around the avocado but not through the pit Separate the two sides One side will have a pit Carefully tap the blade of the knife into the pit and then twist The pit will loosen and come out easily
