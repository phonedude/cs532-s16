In 7th grade nerves almost stopped her from reaching her first starting line but with the encouragement of her mom and coach youngKatie Howery hada great first race and as the saying goes the rest is historyAn accountant by day an elite runner by the crack of dawn Katie now Katie Scheimann will toe the line at her first Olympic Trials this Saturday
A collegiate runner for the University of Minnesota Katie began to dabble in half marathons after her eligibility ended Like most runners she found the need for a new goal She ran a 252 and won her debut the 2009 Fox Cities Marathon With this strong showing Katie knew with a little more marathoning experience an Olympic Trials Qualifierwas within her grasp
8220After my first marathon my thenboyfriend clued me in that I could even qualify for the marathon trials and what the standard was It certainly became my mission after that point8221 Katie said It took a few tries she even thought it wasn8217t meant to be at one point but eventually Katie did just that she qualified for the 2016 Marathon Trials on the last day of the twoandahalfyear qualifying window and did it with her husband Christopher by her side more

Salty  February 10 2016 1255 pm   Interviews The Elites




Remember the exhilaration and nervousness of lining up at the start of your first marathon Picture that and then imagine you8217re toeing the line with Kara Goucher Shalane Flanagan Desi Linden and nearly 200 of the other current fastest women distance runners in the US all vying for a spot on the US Olympic Team For sports psychologistintraining Stephanie Dinius this isn8217t just an exercise in visualization this will be her reality as she lines up to run the Olympic Trials Marathon this Saturday
I met Stephanie in Jacksonville She8217s so friendly and warm and positivity oozes out of her every pore As I stood at the finish line waiting for the women to round the track to the finish at the Jax Half I heard the telltale cheers looked over and who was leading the charge Stephanie STEPHANIE
She looked strong fluid and joyful as she edged Esther Atkins to the line Once finished she Esther and the thirdplace finisher Laurie Knowles congratulated the newly qualified Keely Maguire Their exuberance especially Stephanie8217s was palpable
As with every Olympic Trials athlete we8217ve profiled so far Stephanie is so much more than a fast runner and a nice person Trust me after reading her story you8217ll have one more amazing woman to cheer for on Saturday as you witness marathoning risingstar Stephanie Dinius take on 262 for the first time more

Giving birth to four kids in seven years is no easy feat But having four kids in seven years while marathon training and thenactually qualifying for the Olympic Marathon Trials in your first marathon Simply amazing That8217s Ellie Hess the former DIII AllAmerican who excelled in the 5k and steeplechase in college Ellie currently trains and races as a member of Cleveland Elite Development and somehow finds the timeandenergy for motherhood and elitelevel running
Ellie wasn8217t always a star runner Shebegan jogging in high school to stay in shape for other sports and quickly found her jogs helped her blow off steam While she could accomplish about an 8minutemile naturally it wasn8217t until she dedicated her athletic energy to running that she realized her full potential She stuck to her other sports through high school but joinedthe crosscountry team at John Carroll University underpeer pressure
I had the pleasure of competing against Ellie in college or more precisely getting beat by Ellie in college and I wanted to learn how she manages to train and compete at such a high level with the many demands of her busy life more

Guess whose legs8230
The 2016 US Olympic Marathon Trials are this weekend Saturday to be exact and we here at Salty Running have been giving you the inside scoop on many of the athletes running You may have plans to watch from the comfort of your home but if you happen tobe in Los Angeles on February 13th you might want to pop on by Did you know it is free to come out and watch this premier event
That8217s right Unlike the Super Bowl the World Series or heck even the Olympic Track and Field Trials the Marathon Trials do not charge admission Score In 2012 James and I made a lastminute decision to travel to Houston TX to watch the Trials and it turned out to be an awesome experience In doing so I learned a few quick tips for spectating more

Who to Watch at the Olympic Trials Ruth Perkins

Cinnamon  February 8 2016 1255 pm   Interviews The Elites




 
If you watched the 2012 Olympic Marathon Trials you might have noticed a woman at the back of the pack having the time of her life smiling and waving to the crowds of spectators lining the streets of Houston While the cameras were fixed on Shalane Desi Kara and Amy some of the women whoqualified for the Trials months or even years before the event did not line up ready to run the race of their livesSuch was the case with Ruth Perkins
After qualifying for her first Olympic Trials in the fall of 2010 Ruth ramped up her training only to arrive in Houston with a sacral stress fracture With the blessing of her orthopedist she planned to run a few miles of the Trials when else might she get the chance But when she got out there she had so much fun that the few miles turned into 18 in the 640s with Ruth dropping out of the race just as Kara Goucher blew by on her way to earning a spot on the 2010 US Olympic Team Miraculously Ruth8217s pelvis held up too
Salty and I had the pleasure of chatting with Ruth in Jacksonville She immediately charmed us with her coke bottle glassesperkymannerisms and wacky sense of humor and we know you8217ll love her too more

Keely Maguire warmingup before the race of her life
It was a rare moment during our trip to Jacksonville that I found myself relaxed and chatting about kids with two other moms All three of us have five year olds so we were sharing funny anecdotes and commiserating as moms do We could have been at the grocery store swimming lessons or a piano recital But we weren8217t One of those moms was less than 24 hours away from nailing an Olympic Trials Qualifier in her first attempt One of those moms isKeely Maguire
It was onlyfive months earlier in August of 2015 after struggling with a seemingly endless string of injuries after graduating from college Keely contemplated giving up the sport of running With some cajoling from her college coach Robert Hoppler who never stopped believing in her Keely decided she8217d give it one last shot qualify for the Olympic Marathon Trials in a half in January or BUST
So with the support of her coach and her family she traveled to Jacksonville to give it a shot

Who to Watch at the Olympic Trials Brett Ely

Pimento  February 2 2016 1255 pm   Interviews The Elites




It8217s not often you meet a fourtime Olympic Trials qualifier likeBrett Ely After a great marathoning career that featured an Olympic Trials 8220A8221 Standard a place on the US Pan American Games team among many other highlights Brett is stepping back from competitive marathoning after the Trials on February 13 2016
Brett is thankfully going into this race healthy after a strong training season and knowing it will be her last competitive marathon is putting everything into this one At 36 Brett has a mental fortitude forged from years of striving for more getting knocked down and then getting right back up Her jitters at the starting line will be tempered by that maturity and experience
Perhaps what8217s most impressive about Brett is that she8217s one of those women who manages to achieve so much as an athlete while alsoachieving so much in her life outside of running andis still one of those women who you can8217t help but want to grab a beer with and chat about this and that If you8217re like me after learning more about her you8217ll be dying to cheer for her in LA as she goes for it One More Time

These days Emily Potter is first and foremost a mom When Salty and I hadlunch with her in Jacksonville the talk was babiesand strollers nap time and preschool prep If you met her at the grocery store you would have no idea about theother lives she8217s had
Then again if you met her at the grocery store near her house outside of Washington DC you8217d probably see her in spandex with her two daughters in a double wide running stroller so you might get a glimpse Even then though you probably wouldn8217t guess that Emily is the kind of woman who can casually just happen to qualify for the Olympic Trials Marathon while on afamily vacation just 10 months after having her second child
But that8217s because you wouldn8217t know her as Major Emily Potter of the United States Army8217s World Class Athlete Program more

Without knowing why when you meet Teal Burrell you quickly realize she8217s just a little different from most elite runners She8217s a little more pensive than many of the women A little more 8230 something Not insular because she8217s very friendly Not introverted because there are lots of elites who are introverted Not intelligent because a lot of elites are that too There8217s something about her that you can8217t quite put your finger on and it8217s immediately intriguing
Learning that she isa PhD in neuroscience and an accomplished writer in the field helps to fill in some of the blanks Teal issmartand it shows in the way she speaks She8217s thoughtful and careful with her wordsFor Teal convention isn8217t running with a teamand it certainly isn8217t media attention In factshe can at times seema little surprised to be where she is In fact by most standards she didn8217t start out as anything special or even close to elitestatusher first marathon time was 407But Teal8217s own standards for herself are much much higher than anyone else8217s and that has taken her far along the road to the 2016 Olympic Marathon Trials in LA more

Late last week the Letsrun boards were abuzz with a thread simply titled 8220This Chick Refers To Herself As Elite8221It piqued my interest because it resurrected the ageold question of what defines elite featured the usual troll chatter and even had the chick8217s husband cracking jokes onpage 4 The chick in question is 25 yearold newlywed Emma Polley ne Kertesz the University of Toledo phenom and former member of the HansonsBrooks ODP
After checking out Emma8217s blog we were convinced that Emma is no ordinarychick Besides her many running accomplishments like being an NCAA All American a 4time MAC Champion a member of Team USA at the 2012Chiba Ekiden World RelayCompetition and a 2016 Olympic Trials qualifier Emma is smart funny and pretty badass Naturally we had to talk to her
When I emailed her and asked her if she8217d like to talk to us about running life and the LetsRun thread about her she enthusiastically agreed She was well aware of the shenanigans on LetsRun calling the thread about her 8220quite the cesspool of insensitive comments8221 However she like us is all aboutwomen championing other women think power of the pack and sticking it to loser internet trolls something we can all get behind
So instead of talking about someone you don8217t know on an anonymous thread we went straight to the source to get to know this eliteinmanyways chick more

Anyone who watches the Olympic Trials Marathon and knows Olivia Mickle will be hard pressed to not cheer for her With her big infectious smile and penchant for goofy socks Olivia8217s positivity shines through everything she does Salty and I had the pleasure of chatting with Olivia when we were in Jacksonville and we couldn8217t wait to tell you all about her
Originally from Sacramento California Olivia ran cross country in high school to get into shape for soccer but soon discovered a hidden talent that took her to Brown as a collegiate runner 8220But I honestly don8217t think I became a runner until junior year of college8221 she says 8220I was injured freshman year didn8217t really know what I was doing sophomore year and then that summer going into junior year I ran higher mileage and everyone was like 8216who the heck are you82178221
She says that was the year she fell in love with running and it showed In 2013 she ran a 3329 10k whichset a new Brown record and earned a rank of16th in theNCAA D1 She also had great success in the5k with a PR of162129 more

The Olympic Marathon Trials are one month from today We have lots planned to celebrate the big day but we8217re kicking it off by introducing you to one of the Trials competitors an American distance running rising star named Lauren JimisonAt 25 she8217s already a threetime marathoner and has a fantastic coach and club behind her back and the most positive outlook on life you can imagine
I had the pleasure to meet Lauren back in 2013 when I ran with theelites at the Gate River Run USATF 15k Championship At the time she was a recent graduate of Asuza Pacific Universityworking for her alma mater and testing the waters of professional road racing We kept in touch as she dove into running completely the next year not only making the transition to fulltime professional runner but also racing her first marathon finishing with a 235 Olympic Trials 8220A8221 qualifier at Grandma8217s Marathon
As the Olympic Marathon Trials approach I had the chance to ask Lauren a few questions about her running background plans for the Trials and more I hope she inspires you as much as she inspires me and that you8217ll join me in cheering her on in LA more

Why Should the Average Runner Care About Elites

Cinnamon  January 7 2016 500 am   Body Image Motivation The Elites




How could a squishy midpack runner like me ever fit in with the elites
So we went to Jacksonville and now you know our reasons but perhaps you are left wondering why a back or middle of the packrunner would care about Jacksonville About elite runners How are these fast women connected to you Why should you care
To dispel any mythshere my first race had a mile pace of 15 minutesand my last race had a pace of 745 I8217ve been the slowest woman on my team many times and it8217s pretty rare that I can hangwith the fastcrowd I8217m happy with my progress but really over four years of writing for SR I8217ve gone from solidly average to just a hairabove averageAs for Jacksonville a week ago I was essentially in the same boat as most other midpackers I8217ll likely never compete with these elite women or at their level so before this weekend I didn8217t thinkthat I fitintoany discussion about them
I knew Jacksonville would be fun and was excited to spend time with my sister there but throughout the experience I wasn8217t quite certain whatour role was Salty tried to explain her ideas to me but itdidn8217t really amount to much out of context Obviously we had taken on a job providing media coverage of women at the biggest elite field a small scale half marathon had ever seen but 8230 why Salty Running isn8217t the Gawker of running or even the New York Times but something was nonetheless compelling me to do this exhausting work Something bigger

On Monday night Esther Atkins published a great article that explained from the participating athlete8217s perspective why the Jacksonville Half was such a special race She highlighted three points participants came for the love of the sport over personal glory the benefits to performance of helping or being helped and the positive buzz surrounding the whole endeavorEverything that Esther Atkins writes about was what intrigued me about this race from go
Back in October when I heard about the plans I immediately reached out to Richard Fannin who had never met me never heard of me had no idea what I was doing but asked me to give him a call to talk about it on the spot While we chatted it was obvioushow passionate he was for the sport and how committed he was to pulling his crazy plan off Maybe because he could tell I shared his passion orprobably just because he8217sreally nice within minutes of making my acquaintance I had an invitation to Jacksonville Having never covered a race having hardly traveled since having kids having absolutely no idea what to expect I jumped I didn8217t know why at the time I8217m usually cautious about these things but my gut made me do it
Esther does spectacular work explaining why Jacksonville was a special race for those elite and subelite runners who raced there but maybe you8217re left wondering why youshould care about Jacksonville Heck you might be wondering why wewent to Jacksonville
We didn8217t go to Jacksonville to rub elbows with running legends or rising stars We didn8217t go to promote ourselves We didn8217t go to provide race playbyplay or to report on stats we8217ll leave that to Fannin We didn8217t go as fangirls We didn8217t go because it was easy for us to get there it wasn8217t

Post race Brianne shows off a strongsplit plan permanent marker completely smudged by the rain

The plan was even 541 splits for 131 miles delivering her pack as close to 11430 as she could If anyone could do it it was Brianne Nelson aka the human metronome a woman reknownedfor her even pacing Shes also one of the few women for whom 541 pace is relatively pedestrian
Brianne is also not someone who runs for glory for her its all about the pursuit of excellence Today it wasnt even about the pursuit of her own although getting in a good pretrials halfmarathon effort definitely helps her in that today she braved chilly temperatures onthe rainy streets of Jacksonville to lead others to excellence Today it was about harnessing the Power of the Pack to help the 21 women who travelled to Jacksonville in hopes of qualifying for the Olympic Marathon Trials

Sunday8217s CIM didn8217t disappoint adding 13 new US women Olympic Trials Qualifiers to the nine it produced in 2013 and the 14 from last year But that doesn8217t begin to tell the whole story
While 13 trials qualifiers is impressive if the trials standard was 246 as it was for the 2012 trials 31 women would have qualified last week A whopping 101 women ran sub300 at this year8217s CIM In a race with just 5800 participants that8217s a lot of excellent racing

When you think of the Olympic Trials you probably don8217t picture a fiftysomething nun lining up on the starting line yet in the first US Women8217s Olympic Marathon Trials in 1984 there was Sister Marion Irvine anxiously awaiting the gun in the crowd with Joan Benoit Samuelson and other younger 8211 much younger 8211 speedsters
There was the grey of the overcast skies and the hair of 54year old Sister Marion Irvine 
So wrote runner and author Jack Welch describing the first American women competing in the marathon distance at the 1984 Olympic Trials in his popular book When Running Was Young and So Were We
I recently met with Marion the Flying Nunto talk about becoming a runner in middle age and how she became theoldest participant not only in the womens marathon but also in ANY event at those Olympic Trials

2010 NYC Marathon
Heythere goes Kristin my friend gestured to the right as a handful of runners sped past our car
That8217s crazy I murmured awestruck I was a half hour away from running my first 5k and the idea of running before a race the idea of running even a yard more than 31 miles seemed two strides short of lunacy
Kristin Barry went on to finish that 2007 race in 1651 just 8 seconds shy of her PR taking the top female spot and besting her then new training partner Sheri Piers by nearly 30 seconds I went on to8230 finish And to remain in awe of my speedy neighbor and friend
A great deal has transpired both on and off the road for Kristin in the seven years since that race including a 2008 and 2012 showing in the Olympic Trials marathon As a newly minted masters runner Barry kindly agreed to share with Salty Running her journey through injury and aging as a competitive runner more

Last week the USATF made news when they announced a new set of Olympic marathon qualifying standards for both men and women To qualify for the 2016 trials race men will have to run a 8216B8217 standard time of 218 and women will have to run a 8216B8217 standard of at least 243 The 8216A8217 standard time for both men and women has also been decreased to 215 for men and 237 for women The logic given for this decision is to increase the level of athleticism andcompetitivenessin the trials race which is backed up by the increase in runners both men and women from 2008 to 2012 despite a tightening of standards between those two Olympic years as well more
