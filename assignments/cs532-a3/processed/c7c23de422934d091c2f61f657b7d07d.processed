        Bernie Sanders has exhibited much better foreignpolicy judgment than Hillary Clinton Yet for some reason thats made little difference so far in the Democratic primary raceKevin Drum captures this dynamic for Mother Jones Comparing Hillary Clinton and Sanders he observes that their much ballyhooed differences on guns are negligible that their approaches to health care will be similar once political constraints are factored in and that the same is true on nearly every other domestic issue Bernie is off to Hillarys lefteither genuinely or rhetoricallybut in office theyd both be constrained to the same placeThats basically correct regulating Wall Street asideHe adds
The one place where they have real differences and those differences might matter is national security But for reasons of their own neither of them really wants to talk much about that Hillary doesnt want to highlight her relative hawkishness in a Democratic primary and Bernie doesnt really want to highlight what his dovishness would mean in practice 
For Drum it all adds up to a vote for Hillary Clinton He speculates that shes a bit more electable than her opponent and a bit more likely to broker effective deals with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell There have been a million noxious compromises along the way but thats how politics works in the real world Plus Id love to see a woman in the White House he concludes I like Bernie I like what he says If I believed he could do all the stuff he talks about hed have my vote But I dont

What baffles me about that analysis is why foreign policy is treated like an afterthought that doesnt factor in the larger calculus Its true that neither Sanders nor Clinton focuses on it in their rhetoric but that doesnt make the subject unimportantSanders may be unlikely to get a singlepayer healthcare bill through Congress But there is every reason to believe that the Vermonter would be much less hawkish than his opponent exactly as he says And that difference is orders of magnitude more important than the domesticpolicy fights that Democrats are havingLets quickly review the consequences of the Iraq War that Hillary Clinton favoredThe rise of ISIS
	Hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis
	Roughly 4500 dead American soldiers
	Tens of thousands of Americans wounded
	6 trillion in costs
Heres what Sanders said when he presciently opposed that same war
Mr Speaker in the brief time I have let me give five reasons why I am opposed to giving the President a blank check to launch a unilateral invasion and occupation of Iraq and why I will vote against this resolution

One I have not heard any estimates of how many young American men and women might die in such a war or how many tens of thousands of women and children in Iraq might also be killed As a caring Nation we should do everything we can to prevent the horrible suffering that a war will cause War must be the last recourse in international relations not the first Second I am deeply concerned about the precedent that a unilateral invasion of Iraq could establish in terms of international law and the role of the United Nations If President Bush believes that the US can go to war at any time against any nation what moral or legal objection could our government raise if another country chose to do the same thing

Third the United States is now involved in a very difficult war against international terrorism as we learned tragically on September 11 We are opposed by Osama bin Laden and religious fanatics who are prepared to engage in a kind of warfare that we have never experienced before I agree with Brent Scowcroft Republican former National Security Advisor for President George Bush Sr who stated An attack on Iraq at this time would seriously jeopardize if not destroy the global counterterrorist campaign we have undertaken

Fourth at a time when this country has a 6 trillion national debt and a growing deficit we should be clear that a war and a longterm American occupation ofIraq could be extremely expensive

Fifth I am concerned about the problems of socalled unintended consequences Who will govern Iraq when Saddam Hussein is removed and what role will the US play in ensuing a civil war that could develop in that country Will moderate governments in the region who have large Islamic fundamentalist populations be overthrown and replaced by extremists Will the bloody conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authority be exacerbated And these are just a few of the questions that remain unanswered
This isnt hard Sanders has much better foreignpolicy judgment than Hillary Clinton You could hardly make up a more stark illustration They were on different sides of the most consequential and disastrous war since Vietnam Yet this difference is dismissed as if it amounts to no more than an afterthought in most comparisonsPerhaps this would make sense if Clinton was no longer a hawkBut after seeing that her instincts were wrong on Iraq and watching the catastrophic consequences Clinton lobbied President Obama to help orchestrate a regime change in Libya Predictably that country is in chaos too Just this week we learned that American troops are preparing to launch an offensive against ISIS there Even so Clinton shows no sign of being any less hawkish due to her misjudgmentsThere is just no evidence that she learned from her mistakesHawkish Democrats should vote for Clinton Democrats who think shes better than all the Republicans and that Bernie Sanders is unelectable should vote for her too But if youre like Kevin Drum an Iraq War skeptic and you might be open to voting for Sanders if only you believed that his differences with Clinton would amount to much in the real world I dont understand the breezy dismissal of foreignpolicy differences Another dumb war of choice is much more likely with Clinton in the White House

        The passing of Antonin Scalia roils the presidential campaign and could leave the Supreme Court deadlocked until 2017 Will the Senate even consider a replacement nominated by President Obama
        
        
            The sudden death of Antonin Scalia an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on Saturday morning will shake up American politics like few events in recent memory reshaping the 2016 presidential campaign and potentially leaving the Supreme Court deadlocked for more than a year13

            On a sultry evening last July a tall softspoken 17yearold named David Stoner and nearly 600 other math whizzes from all over the world sat huddled in small groups around wicker bistro tables talking in low voices and obsessively refreshing the browsers on their laptops The air in the cavernous lobby of the Lotus Hotel Pang Suan Kaew in Chiang Mai Thailand was humid recalls Stoner whose light South Carolina accent warms his carefully chosen words The tension in the room made it seem especially heavy like the atmosphere at a highstakes poker tournament13

            March was a hugely important month for religion and the Supreme Court and a pivotal moment for Justice Antonin Scalia the subject of a fat new biography Too bad we couldnx2019t talk plainly about what was and is at stake In a country historically averse to political debates about competing faiths nowhere is frank discussion of religion more taboo than at the US Supreme Court x201CReligion is the third rail of Supreme Court politics Itx2019s not something thatx2019s talked about in polite companyx201D as Jeff Shesol the author of a book about the New Deal Court put it He was speaking with NPRx2019s Nina Totenberg in 2010 when John Paul Stevens was looking at retirement and for the first time in American history there was the prospect of six Catholics three Jews and no Protestants on the highest court in the landx2014a watershed almost too x201Cradioactivex201D Totenberg remarked even to note And beware of venturing any further than that as the University of Chicago Law Schoolx2019s Geoffrey Stone did in a controversial 2007 blog post suggesting that the Supreme Courtx2019s five conservatives likely derived their abortion views from Catholic doctrine Scaliax2014a devout Catholic and the current Courtx2019s longestserving conservativex2014announced a boycott of the school until Stone leaves the faculty13

x201CAnticolonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decadesx201D Andreessen wrote x201CWhy stop nowx201D13

After that the Internet went nuts13

Andreessen deleted his tweet apologized and underscored that he is x201C100 percent opposed to colonialismx201D and x201C100 percent in favor of independence and freedomx201D Zuckerberg Facebookx2019s CEO followed up with his own Facebook post to say Andreessenx2019s comment was x201Cdeeply upsettingx201D to him and not representative of the way he thinks x201Cat allx201D13

        Einsteinrsquos gravitational waves rest on a genuinely radical idea
        
        
            After decades of anticipation we have directly detected gravitational wavesx2014ripples in spacetime traveling at the speed of light through the universe Scientists at LIGO the Laser Interferometic Gravitationalwave Observatory have announced that they have measured waves coming from the inspiral of two massive black holes providing a spectacular confirmation of Albert Einsteinx2019s general theory of relativity whose hundredth anniversary was celebrated just last year13
13
Finding gravitational waves indicates that Einstein was once again right and opens a new window onto energetic events occurring around the universe But therex2019s a deeper lesson as well a reminder of the central importance of locality an idea that underlies much of modern physics13

            I am one of the 10 million people who acquired an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus ten days ago13

Coming from Planet Android I wasnx2019t as put off by the larger dimensions as everyone else in the technosphere seemed to be But I was as usual put off by one thing that both the Apple product and its archnemesis from Google shared the unpocketability of the phone particularly by females13
13
This isnx2019t a new problem for women Our skinny jeans have pockets but there is no way an object bigger than a standard issue ID card fits in the front and everyone knows that slipping a phone in your back pocket is an invitation for a treacherous dive into a toilet or a backflip resulting in heartbreaking shatters Purses have enclosures that were once suitable for the flip phone generation but have since become too snug for newer models Throwing it into the main compartment seems risky at best13

        Meryl Streep explained her allwhite filmfestival jury by claiming that ldquowersquore all Africans reallyrdquo Shersquos right and so wrong
        
        
            Meryl Streep at the Berlin film festival this week was asked whyx2014given OscarsSoWhite given that itx2019s 2016 given that come onx2014she had convened an allwhite panel to judge this yearx2019s festival entrants Invoking the rhetoric of an American president who had visited Berlin in the course of the last century Streep dismissed objections to her panelx2019s monochromism x201CThe thing that I notice is that there is a core of humanity that travels right through every culturex201D she said x201CAnd after all wex2019re all from Africa originally you know Wex2019re all Berliners wex2019re all Africans reallyx201D13

This wasnx2019t terribly surprising When Streep was asked last year in the course of promoting her extremely feminist film Suffragette whether she is herself a feminist the actor replied that no she isnx2019t Instead x201CI am a humanistx201D she said x201CI am for nice easy balancex201D 13

            As it stands the international coalition is far from winning the information war against the Islamic State Its air strikes may be squeezing the group in Iraq and Syria and killing many of its leaders but that has not halted the selfproclaimed caliphatex2019s ideological momentum Indeed at the end of 2015 it was estimated that the number of foreigners travelling to join militant groups in Iraq and Syriax2014predominantly the Islamic Statex2014had more than doubled in the course of just 18 months Whatx2019s more while these figures may be striking sheer numbers are less important than intent when it comes to the organizationx2019s actual threat to the world As we have already seen it takes a very small number of people to unleash great terror whether in Iraq Syria or elsewhere13

        Ben Stillerrsquos followup to his own comedy classic is a downright bummer no matter how many celebrity cameos it tries to cram in
        
        
            You donx2019t need to go to the theater to get the full experience of Zoolander 2 Simply get your hands on a copy of the original watch it and then yell a bunch of unfunny topical lines every time somebody tells a joke Thatx2019s how it feels to watch Ben Stillerx2019s sequel to his 2001 spoof of the fashion industry Zoolander 2 takes pains to reference every successful gag you remember from the original and then embellish them in painfulx2014often offensive almost always outdatedx2014fashion Itx2019s a film that has no real reason to exist and it spends its entire running time reaffirming that fact13
13
13
The original Zoolander to be fair had no business being as funny as it wasx2014it made fun of an industry that already seems to exist in a constant state of selfparody and much of its humor relied on simple malapropisms and sight gags But it was hilarious anyway as a candid snapshot of the fizzlingout of x201990s culture Like almost any zeitgeist comedy it belonged to a particular momentx2014and boy should it have stayed there With Zoolander 2 Stiller who directed cowrote and stars tries to recapture the magic of 2001 by referencing its past glories with increasing desperation perhaps to avoid the fact that he has nothing new to say about the fashion industry or celebrity culture 15 years laters13

13
Many people in this world would find my behavior rather strange Thatx2019s because Americans are exceptionally promiscuous when it comes to professing their love In the United States x201CI love youx201D is at once exalted and devalued It can mean everything  or nothing at all This is not universally the case13
