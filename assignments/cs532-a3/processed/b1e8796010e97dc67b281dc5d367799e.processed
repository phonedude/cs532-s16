				This weekend the Carolina Panthers will take on the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 And since this NFL championship game has been televised weve seen a steady stream of notable even iconic commercials make their debut during the broadcasts
Its not surprising The Super Bowl is always one of the most watched sports events in the world last years Super Bowl XLIX raked in a record 1144 million viewers Given this companies are willing to spend millions for a 30second ad spot within the game And that has resulted in some of the best most hilarious crazy even heartwrenching commercials to have ever graced our TV screens
Remember Budweisers Wassup and its Clydesdale horses Or the ETrade baby What about Michael Jordan and Larry Bird competing in epic free throws for a McDonalds Big Mac Or Ali Landry skillfully catching Doritos in her mouth in a laundromat From Pepsi and Coca Cola to Budweiser Volkwagen Xerox Doritos Noxema and Snickers companies of all kinds have become a part of Super Bowl history
On Tuesday February 2 CBS aired a twohour special highlighting the 50 best Super Bowl commercials of all time According to Variety the special hosted by retired quarterback Boomer Esiason and actresssinger Katharine McPhee Scorpion raked in a total of 114 million viewers and was the top program for the important 1849 demographic
So what are some of the best Super Bowl commercials of all time There area ton of pretty great ones But weve narrowed it down to 10 of the most notable from the past few decades


Up for Whatever Budweiser 2014
Please enable Javascript to watch this video
As one of several Budweiser spots on this list Bud accounted for about a dozen entries on CBS list the beer company took a unique approach and decided to appeal to our penchant for reality TV A hot gal walks up to an unsuspecting patron in a bar no really and offers him a Bud on one condition he has to be up for whatever Accepting the challenge he sets out on a nightly journey that includes playing ping pong with Arnold Schwarzenegger getting fitted for a sports jacket by model Minka Kelly and running into Don Cheadle and a llama in an elevator No doubt this was the best day of this guys life and the commercial paid off in spades for Budweiser when it went viral and led to a followup spot in 2015


1984 Apple 1984
Please enable Javascript to watch this video
Faced with stiff competition from IBM Apple contracted movie director Ridley Scott for this controversial but iconic ad that suggested viewers break the mold and opt for the upcoming Macintosh computer instead of those bland boxes The powerful message avoid creating a metoo society that can be likened to George Orwells terrifying one from the novel 1984 While Apple almost pulled the ad for fear of its reception were glad they didnt It demonstrated what Steve Jobs was capable of and his unwavering confidence to take the company on its own path toward success


Hey Kid Catch Mean Joe Greene Coca Cola 1979
Please enable Javascript to watch this video
Way back in 1979 this Coca Cola commercial tugged hard at our heartstrings A nineyearold boy approaches the limping stonefaced strapping 64 football player after a game offering up some help then his Coca Cola only to dejectedly walk away after handing it over That is until Green calls him back smiles and throws a jersey at him In the aforementioned CBS special Green and Tommy Okon who played the boy reunite almost 40 years later to talk about the touching ad and reveal that they have remained friends ever since They were both in tears recalling the memories And you will be too once you watch the sweet ad


Talking Stain Tide To Go 2008

Its hard not to crack up watching this one Theres just something about it thats completely relatable To promote its new penlike Tide To Go stain removers the company got the message across perfectly by illustrating just how distracting a stain can be during one of the most stressful situations we encounter in life The job interview Hilarious


Wassup Budweiser1999
Please enable Javascript to watch this video
Chances are you cringe today if someone shouts Wassup with his tongue outstretched Thats sooo 90s right But back then Budweiser managed to create a pop culture phrase through this single ad which led to a series of others over the next few years The funniest followup came two years later and involved a group of Caucasian males with their much more er refined version called What are you doing Together both make this list
