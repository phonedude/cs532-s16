        What Hillary Clinton really said about TPP and the gold standard

                Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton took center stage at the first Democratic presidential debate Reuters
              
            
          
             
                  
     
              
      
        
      

      
        Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended her opposition of the TransPacific Partnership in the first Democratic debate of the 2016 race

Clinton announced last week that she no longer supports the international trade deal despite supporting it while serving as secretary of state  once calling it the quotgold standardquot CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper picked up on those words and asked Clinton about her reversal at the Oct 13 debate in Las Vegas

quotI did say when I was secretary of state three years ago that I hoped it would be the gold standardquot Clinton said quotIt was just finally negotiated last week and in looking at it it didn39t meet my standards My standards for more new good jobs for Americans for raising wages for Americans And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middleclass American and say lsquothis will help raise your wagesrsquo And I concluded I could notquot

Clintonrsquos phrasing  that she said she quothoped it would be the gold standardquot  implies that she was undecided on the TPP But that doesnrsquot exactly match up to her prior comments We found that her previous remarks actually gave the impression that she had confidence in the deal as it stood

In Australia in 2012 Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the USAustralia relationship Herersquos everything she said about the TPP in that address with the quotgold standardquot comment in bold

quotSo it39s fair to say that our economies are entwined and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the TransPacific Partnership or TPP Australia is a critical partner This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field And when negotiated this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world39s total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environmentquot

So it seems Clinton is saying the TPP does definitevely set the gold standard  as opposed to Clinton hoping it will

In other addresses around the same time she expressed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet a high standard In November 2012 remarks in Singapore she encouraged all nations quotwilling to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPPquot to join the deal

quotThe socalled TPP will lower barriers raise standards and drive longterm growth across the region It will cover 40 percent of the world39s total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions including for women migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia39s middle class and rebalance the global economy Canada and Mexico have already joined the original TPP partners We continue to consult with Japan And we are offering to assist with capacity building so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join We welcome the interest of any nation willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP including Chinaquot

Here are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013 quotexcitingquot quotinnovativequot quotambitiousquot quotgroundbreakingquot quotcuttingedgequot quothighqualityquot and quothighstandardquot To read more of her comments in full check out our previous article on this subject

As a presidential candidate Clinton has used more hedging language for example saying she has quotsome concernsquot and now she has said she outright doesnrsquot support the deal as it stands

In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices she wrote

quotBecause TPP negotiations are still ongoing it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement Itrsquos safe to say the TPP wonrsquot be perfect  no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be  but its higher standards if implemented and enforced should benefit American businesses and workersquot

In fairness to Clinton the TPP was still under negotiation when Clinton made the quotgold standardquot comment The partners only finalized the deal this year Itrsquos quite possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations when Clinton was at the State Department  something Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out to us for this factcheck The negotiations have been conducted in secret so itrsquos hard for us to assess that ourselves Also as secretary of state she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal

Our ruling

Clinton said when she was secretary of state she was reserving judgment but quothoped the TransPacific Partnership would be the gold standardquot

Shersquos twisting her 2012 remarks a bit Clinton said quotThis TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreementsquot which is a more confident claim than if she had said she quothopedquot it would meet that standard This is in contrast to more recent comments where Clinton said she had concerns about the deal and that she ultimately opposes it

The statement is distorting her previous comments We rate it Half True
