In a recent interview for Rolling Stone Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders argued that the key to victory for his campaign will be to turn out the vote As he told Rolling Stone 8220I will not get elected unless there are a lot of workingclass people who have turned their backs on the political system now getting engaged in the system8221

According to the US Census Bureau just 419 percent of votingage Americans voted in 2014 the lowest turnout rate since 1978 And while 618 percent of Americans turned out in the last presidential election in 2012 the longterm trend has been one of decline
 
But if voter turnout were to grow dramatically in 2016 it8217s not so clearcut that Sanders would be the winner of those votes The majority of today8217s nonvoters aren8217t disengaged partisans waiting for the right candidate to ignite their interest Rather the vast majority of nonvoters selfidentify as 8220moderates8221  if they have an ideological identity at all  This means the candidate most likely to benefit from greater turnout might be the one who best appeals to the deciding bloc in any presidential contest the center 

In Lincoln Park Strategies8217 latest national survey of 1000 Americans conducted Nov 1719 we found that among Americans who aren8217t registered to vote only 11 consider themselves liberal and just 13 consider themselves conservative A majority of unregistered Americans consider themselves moderate 51 and a quarter 25 don8217t know Among registered voters in contrast 27 consider themselves liberal 21 are conservative and 47 say they are moderate while just 4 say they don8217t know   In other words there8217s a 16point difference between the share of liberals among registered voters versus unregistered voters and an 8point difference between the share of conservatives 



Setting aside unregistered Americans who do not know their political ideology  assuming they are unlikely to turn out to vote  the remaining pool of unregistered potential voters becomes 67 moderate in its ideological makeup while the share of liberals increases to 15 and conservatives make up 18 



Another factor that makes it unlikely that turning out the vote will result in either a liberal or conservative 8220surge8221 is that many unregistered voters are considerably less informed about the differences between the various candidates  

For example our survey found that many unregistered voters do not see how the ideology of Bernie Sanders differs from that of Donald Trump8217s Indeed among Americans who are not registered to vote 17 think that Senator Sanders is liberal and 20 think that he is a moderate Similarly 17 think that Donald Trump is a liberal and 22 consider him moderate 

To reach the Americans whom Bernie Sanders is hoping will lead the country8217s political revolution Sanders will need to fight not just inertia from the nonvoting public to get them to the polls but a lack of knowledge about the issues central to his campaign And after all that he may still not be the candidate who benefits
