							Hillary Clinton last week lunged into her most flagrant fit of hypocrisy yet
With Bernie Sanders surging she took new aim at the rich  including their use of tax dodges
She told MSNBC We can go after some of these schemes 8230 the kind of misclassifying of income trying to make it look like its a capital gain when its really ordinary income going ahead and routing income through the Bahamas or the Cayman Islands or wherever
Huh Bloomberg News reported in 2014 on the Clintons use of a prime tax dodge They put their Chappaqua home into a residence trust in 2010 Such trusts can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes
Meanwhile the Clintons family wealth has grown bigtime thanks to firms with significant holdings in places like  the Caymans
As The Daily Caller notes Bill Clinton spent years as a partner in his nowex buddy Ron Burkles investment fund Yucaipa Global  registered in the Cayman Islands In five years Bill pocketed at least 10 million
In 2011 her hubby also earned at least 225000 in speaking fees from Whisky Productions for an event that will target the business community in Grand Cayman
Its a family thing Chelsea Clintons hubby Marc Mezvinsky is a partner in a hedge fund with multiple holdings incorporated in the Cayman Islands
And dont get us started on the whole clans use of the Clinton Foundation
A candidate luxuriating in the poshest glass house should think twice before throwing populist stones

      She knows that most of the people following her are not educated enough to know that she does the same thing through her trust and through the clinton foundation So she can make these statements and the people think she is taking from the rich and giving it to them in return for votes Shes all politician and not morals or interest in serving the people However some ideas to get votes may turn out to work for the people but that may be a side effect

      We democrats love Hillary and her Bill They will make a perfect pair in WH They will succeed even more if they hire Berney Sunders so that we get rid of those super rich and use their money to distribute them to 90 of Americans thus allowing them not working And the dream of Obama of making America a new country will be done in next 8 years And we should not allow Trump get elected so that another Obamas plan of allowing people to come to America will be accomplished as well

      I am getting so tired of these sanctimonious people accusing other people who hide their money in places like the Caymen Island or buying products from China I dont blame people for doing that You would be a fool not to The problem is allowing it As long as it is legal why not do it Blame it on our politicians for allowing it to happen Same with Walmart People keep criticizing Walmart but they are allowed to do it There is no law restricting what they do as long as the law allows them Who is really going to church these days anyway and they are the ones pickpocketing them anyway All this needs to stop but you cant blame people for doing it when it is allowed
