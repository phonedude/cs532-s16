for America the program that places newly minted college graduates in some of the nations most difficult classrooms for twoyear teaching stints is holding a summit this weekend in Washington to mark its 25th anniversary The list of speakers reads like a whos who of activists and leaders behind recent changes in education policy around the country from former DC Schools chancellor Michelle Rhee to Eva Moskowitz the head of the largest chain of charter schools in New York City The singer Janelle Mone will entertain at a glittery gathering of an estimated 15000 Teach For America alumni the organizations many donors will also be on hand And roaming among them is Gary Rubinstein a nationally known scold of TFA Rubinstein a former TFA volunteer who is in his 14th year of teaching math at Stuyvesant High School in New York City says he wants to force an honest discussion about TFA  including its weaknesses To that end he created a Twitter account TFA25FactCheck and a new blog and will attend the summit looking for opportunities to inject what he calls reality into discussions about the best ways to improve public education He is helping to organize a happy hour for those who share his concerns about TFA and said he will also hold an impromptu discussion during the threeday event after he said his requests to join official panels were spurned by TFA organizers   Gary Rubenstein a former Teach for America volunteer who is now a critic of the organization Courtesy of Gary RubensteinCourtesy of Gary Rubenstein   TFA no better than other teachers in elementary level study finds  Takirra Winfield a spokeswoman for TFA said the organization cant accommodate everyone who wanted to speak on panels but noted that it has included Randi Weingarten president of the American Federation of Teachers and frequent critic of TFA as well as others with diverse viewpoints We are focusing on progress for our kids and communities instead of engaging in a back and forth that at the end of the day is a distraction from the real issues Winfield said in an email She noted that on Sunday TFA will provide a brunch for those who want to discuss critiques of TFA Our thoughtful critics make us better Rubinstein said he will call out any examples of spinning or exaggeration he sees One example Rubinstein tweeted a photo of a graphic that was displayed at one workshop that showed the District as the urban district with the largest gains in math and reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress NAEP from 2011 to 2015 Rubinstein tweeted that DCs scores were so low that even after the gains it still was the worst performing of the major urban districts DC Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson was a TFA Corps member in New York in 1992 Im here to disrupt this said Rubinstein 46 as he walked largely unnoticed around the cavernous Walter E Washington Convention Center Rubinstein said TFA exaggerates the success of its program and alumni while at the same time overemphasizing the role of teachers contributing to a political climate that blames educators for the academic struggles of lowincome children  Harvard launches a different way to build a better teacher  TFA is so allied with this education reform this Waiting for Superman narrative that it ignores other factors said Rubinstein referring to the 2010 documentary that was critical of traditional public schools and featured Rhee as she challenged tenure and other union protections for teachers The film portrayed nonunionized charter schools as a salvation and followed families as they tried to win admission through a lottery The truth is schools need more resources Rubinstein said If theres a highpoverty school it needs way more resources  potentially breakthebank resources It needs smaller class sizes Im talking four students to one teacher But TFA doesnt talk about that Of TFAs approximately 50000 alumni 65 percent work in education or shape policy in some capacity  as teachers principals superintendents charter school executives or in local state or federal government according to the organization That has led to the proliferation of reckless policy changes such as the notion that teaching quality can be judged by student test scores or that charter schools are inherently superior to traditional schools Rubinstein said I really think education has gotten worse in this country because of these types of reforms Rubinstein said I hope TFA will start to explore other explanations for the achievement gap than the bad teacher narrative Rubinstein began publishing his criticisms on a blog five years ago Since then several TFA alumni have written negatively about their experiences saying that TFAs fiveweek training session did not adequately prepare them for teaching in struggling schools and that the twoyear commitment that TFA requires adds to the teacher churn in highneeds schools Those criticisms combined with pressure from teachers unions have led some jurisdictions to cancel plans to place TFA recruits in schools The organization has seen a downturn in recruiting although TFA executives blame that on a strengthening economy and the fact that new college graduates have more job options than they have in recent years But dings from Rubinstein and others have not gone unnoticed by TFA Late last year a nonprofit group loosely connected to TFA began a public relations campaign called Corps Knowledge to defend TFA against critics  Rapid response unit created to combat TFA critics  Corps Knowledge challenged Rubinstein in a post last year on its Facebook page called The Misanthropy of Gary Rubinstein in which it suggested that Rubinstein had given up on lowincome students to work at Stuyvesant one of the highestperforming public schools in the country It has not followed up with anything aimed at Rubinstein since   Lyndsey Layton has been covering national education since 2011 writing about everything from parent trigger laws to povertys impact on education to the shifting politics of school reform       The Freddie Gray case   Sign up for email updates on the trials Youve signed up for email updates on this story   Sign up
