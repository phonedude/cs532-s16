        Many consider Apples 1984 Super Bowl ad directed by Ridley Scott one of the best Super Bowl ads ever

   For lots of people Super Bowl Sunday isnt even about the football its about the commercials Over the years advertising spots during the Super Bowl have become more elaborate more talked about and more expensive than ever   CBS which is airing Super Bowl 50 this Sunday is charging advertisers between 48 and 5 million for a 30second spot Thats up from a 44 million average cost last year and 25 million a decade ago according to Kantar Media Last years game drew a record 1144 million viewers with even more expected this year   With the hefty price tag for television time advertisers are integrating social media and online advertising to try to maximize exposure And companies are even putting the ads on YouTube in advance of the Big Game   So what should we expect this year   Compared to last year were really seeing much more fun says Jeanine Poggi who covers the TV industry for Advertising Age This years Super Bowl will be a lot more starstudded she told NPRs Michel Martin Poggi says this years ads include about 40 celebrities up from about 28 last year   In this ad for Bud Light Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen say Americas shared love of beer will bring the country together

   If youve ever wondered what it would be like to see Jeff Goldblum sing and play a piano as it goes up the side of an apartment building heres your chance   
    
        
    
        
            

                
                    
                    YouTube
                
        

   Christopher Walken says socks can be exciting and so can the Kia Optima   
    
        
    
        
            

                
                    
                    YouTube
                
        

   This is after last year when most of the talkedabout ads took a serious tone   We actually were kind of dubbing it the Somber Bowl Poggi says There was cyber bullying domestic abuse   This Nationwide commercial from last year about a boy who got killed from preventable household accidents got a lot of backlash   
    
        
    
        
            

                
                    
                    YouTube
                
        

   Thats just depressing says Poggi who says that serious ads do tend to outperform humorous ones But if you have a Super Bowl filled with these depressing sad ads none of them stand out from each other   The Super Bowl is one of the few times advertisers can get a massive audience in the age of Netflix and hundreds of cable channels   And how do the modern ads stack up against some old favorites   Michael Hiltzik argued in the Los Angeles Times that no Super Bowl ad will ever top the 1984 Apple ad for the Macintosh computer which set the standard that Super Bowl ads should be different   
    
        
    
        
            

                
                    
                    YouTube
                
        

   Some lists put this 1979 Mean Joe Greene ad for CocaCola as one of the best maybe because many people still remember it   
    
        
    
        
            

                
                    
                    YouTube
                
        

   The Budweiser frogs ad from 1995 was a simple concept But at least you remember what it was for   
    
        
    
        
            

                
                    
                    YouTube
                
        

   And USA Today puts this McDonalds ad with Larry Bird and Michael Jordan at the top of its list
