2We fried up our Ore IdaBold and CrispySeasoned Fries in thefry daddy Fries are so tasty when they are hot fried and crispy If you have plain fries with no seasoningdont fretjust add some Lawrysseasoned salt after they are done cooking After you are done frying top with shredded parmesan cheese and parsley Drizzle with white truffle oil You can either drizzle the truffle garlic aioli on top of fries or use as a dip Or do both Both We did both Just do bothGARLIC ARTICHOKE BRUSCHETTA
1 can of artichoke hearts 85 ounces
1 block of softened cream cheese 8 ounces
1 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded parmesan cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons real mayo
2 teaspoons minced garlicjar
Sea salt to taste
Crush black pepper to taste
Parsley to garnish
Smoked paprika to garnish
Olive oil
1 loaf fresh french bread We used the precut slices
Directions
1 Place artichoke hearts in a food processor Mix until all the artichokes are mostly chopped Place artichokes in a bowl with cream cheese sour cream parmesan cheese mozzarella cheese mayonnaise and garlic Add some salt and pepper to your liking to the mixture
2 Preheat your oven at 350 Olive oil the bottom of the slices of bread and place on a cookie sheet Put the artichoke mixture on top of the bread and add some crushed black pepper on top
3 Put them in the oven for 56 minutes watching the bottoms When they just start to get golden on the bottom turn your oven on broil on low and get the tops bubbly This does not take long so keep an eye on the bread so it does not burn You could also precook the bread slices by themselves until they are crispy then add the dip on top and place in oven on broil for a few minutes until mixture is bubbly Either way its delicious
4 Take out of oven and garnish with shredded parmesan cheese parsley and smoked paprika
You can also try on these ideas for size
Use the delicious mixture you just made as a dip Instead of putting it on the french bread just put it in a baking dish and in the oven at 350 for about 2530 minutes
Or were you invited to a last minute sportsball partyWe have thrown it in the microwave in desperate situationsCooktilwarm and bubbly
Say what  you can even put this dip in a crockpot
