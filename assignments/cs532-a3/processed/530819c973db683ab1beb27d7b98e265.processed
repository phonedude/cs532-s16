Inhabitantsedit
Archeological excavations have discovered evidence and remains of Aleuts living on Agattu Island as early as 760 BCE5 Based on the number of simultaneously inhabited archeological sites on the island experts have estimate that the precontact population may have reached 5001000 individuals5 After Russian contact with the Aleutians in 1751 the population on Agattu declined precipitously Russian traders would stay multiple years at a time in the Near islands hunting sea otter Interactions with the Aleuts were sometimes violent A veteran Russian navigator was killed by the locals on Agattu in 17616 By the 1760s all Near Islanders had moved into a single village on Attu Island During World War II the villagers of Attu were interned in Japan and at wars end the survivors were resettled on Atka Island7
Geologyedit
Agattu is unique among the volcanic Aleutian Islands in being composed almost entirely of wellbedded sedimentary rocks These rocks were clearly deposited in water and are composed chiefly of amorphous silica and fine detritus derived from a volcanic terrain Igneous rocks are sparsely represented by intrusions of porphyry diabase and trap The entire island has been heavily glaciated8
