        Hillary Clinton says she and Bill were dead broke

        Hillary Clinton is walking the line between being remarkably successful and yet still in touch with the lives of ordinary people The former secretary of state and potentialnbsp2016 presidential candidate has found herself trying to limitnbspblowback to her claim that she and husband Bill were quotdead brokequot when they left the White House

She made the comment during an interview with ABCrsquos Diane Sawyer Sawyer pressed Clinton on a reported haul of 5 million in speaking fees

quotYou have no reason to remember but we came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debtquot Clinton said quotWe had no money when we got there and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses for Chelsea39s education It was not easy Bill has worked really hard And it39s been amazing to me He39s worked very hardquot

Republicans called the claim laughable and the next day Clinton clarified again on ABC that she and Bill had done very well over the past 14 years

quotWe have a life experience that is clearly different in very dramatic ways from many Americansquot Clinton said quotBut we also have gone through some of the same challenges many people havequot

We wanted to take a closer look at Clintonrsquos claim of being quotdead brokequot when their time in the White House ended after December 2000

The Clintonsrsquo balance sheet

Clintonrsquos 2000 Senate financial disclosure form via the Open Secrets website provides a rough view of the balance between the couplersquos assets and liabilities These forms only show amounts in broad ranges  from 15001 to 50000 from 50001 to 100000 and so forth  but under any set of assumptions the Clintons were in the red a problem driven by Bill Clintonrsquos enormous legal bills

Their highest possible assets totaled about 18 million while their lowest possible debts were nearly 23 million The most optimistic scenario left them in a hole of about 500000

But the federal disclosure form does not include homes used for personal use and the Clintons owned two In 1999 they bought a fivebedroom home in Chappaqua NY for 17 million In December 2000 just as they were leaving the White House they bought a sevenbedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington DC The price was 285 million

While those homes had mortgages which would increase the amount of the Clintons39 debt the family also had equity in them The New York Times reported that the Clintons put 855000 down on the Washington house for instance That equity would have covered the lowend debt estimate of about 500000

Point being Clintonrsquos 2000 disclosure doesnrsquot prove the Clintonsrsquo liabilities exceeded their assets when they left the White House

We reached out to Hillary Clintonrsquos office for more details and did not hear back

Were they dead broke

All this begs the question of whether someone who can afford to buy a 285 million house is quotdead brokequot We reached two accounting professors at Ohio State Universityrsquos Fisher College of Business one of the topranked schools in the country Assistant Professor Jeffrey Hoopes said to call the Clintons dead broke would be a stretch for how the term is commonly understood

quotAlmost any president leaving office can expect tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of future earnings as a result of their having been presidentquot Hoopes said quotSpeaking consulting board positions and so on are all very lucrativequot

Professor Brian Mittendorf said a balance sheet of assets and liabilities simply doesnrsquot paint a complete picture Mittendorf compared the Clintons to a medical school graduate saddled with huge debts but with the prospect of a very hefty income down the line

quotWhile one can claim to be technically broke creditors wouldn39t take it as such as long as future income streams could cover the liabilitiesquot Mittendorf said

In December 2000 at least one large bank saw the Clintons through that lens Whatever their balance sheet might have been Citibank lent them 1995 million to buy that house in Washington DC This was a safe loan By Feb 5 2001 Bill Clinton was commanding regular speaking fees of 125000 or more

Hillary Clinton herself did quite well in 2001 The book publisher Simon and Schuster paid her 284 million in royalties

By 2004 the Clintons had erased their debts and Hillary Clinton was ranked the 10thwealthiest member of the Senate with a net worth between 10 million and 50 million

Our ruling

Hillary Clinton said she and Bill were in debt and dead broke when they left the White House The public record shows that they possibly had more liabilities than assets but it doesnrsquot show that conclusively More important a balance sheet does not tell the full story and the experts we reached said the Clintonsrsquo earning potential had a real economic value that the financial sector traditionally acknowledges and is willing to bank on

A few weeks before they left the White House the Clintons were able to muster a cash down payment of 855000 and secure a 1995 million mortgage This hardly fits the common meaning of quotdead brokequot

We rate the claim MostlynbspFalse
