From veteran quarterback Peyton Manning to fifthyear linebacker Von Miller the Broncos boast a number of reasons on both sides of the ball why they can win the franchises third championship after disastrously losing to the Seahawks two years earlier in Super Bowl XLVIII

Denversindisputable advantage is its dominating defense
The Broncos led the NFL in total defense andpass defense and their 52 sacksduring the regular season were an NFL high The Broncos also ranked third in rush defense and fourth in points allowed 183Denver limited its opponents to2831 yards per gameandforced27 turnovers Miller led the team with 11 sacks and four more players registered at least five sacks this season

Despite having the No 1 defense in the league the Broncos face a new and unfamiliar challenge in Panthersdualthreat quarterback Cam Newton Newton rushed 153 times for 686 yards and 10touchdowns during the regular season and six of those scores wererecorded against teams ranked in the top 10 in total defense
The most rushing attempts a quarterback hadagainst Denvers stout defense this season was six by the Colts Andrew Luck and Chiefs Alex Smith who rushed for 34 and 33 yards respectively The Broncos lost both games
Opposite a fiercedefense is an adaptable Broncosoffense that simply refuses to quit
The Broncos wouldnt have made it to Super Bowl 50 if it wasntfor their versatilequarterbacksDespite being one of the most balanced teams in the league Denver wasnt immune toinjuries this season and found out firsthand just how important a reliable backup quarterback can be when Brock Osweiler was forced into the starting roleafter Manning went out with a foot injury
After spending six weeks on the sideline battling a torn plantar fascia in his left foot Manningmade an impressive return when he entered the Broncos regularseason finale against the Chargers and helped leadthe team to victory
BRONCOS Greatest of alltime  Roster breakdown  Five defining moments
Denver got by during his absence with a little help from Osweiler who went 52 as a starter in place ofManning and played a critical role in the Broncos earning the top seed in the AFC and securing homefield advantage throughout the playoffs with crucial comeback wins over the Patriots and Bengals
On the groundRonnie Hillman and CJ Anderson are a force to be reckoned with  they combined for 1583 yards and 12 touchdownsOverall the Broncos are 101 when the teamrushes for at least 100 yards and 110when Anderson gets at least 11 carries By perfecting their running game the backfield Broncos willhelp take some pressure off Manning That in turn would allow him to find the teams top targets via the pass wide receiversDemaryius Thomas 105 for 1304 yards and six TDs andEmmanuel Sanders 76 for 1135 six TDs and tight end Owen Daniels 46 for 517 five TDs
In what could be Mannings final game amid swirling retirement rumors Newton will lead an explosive Panthers offense against the powerfulpass rush of the Broncos as the No 1 scoring offense prepares to square off against the No 1 defense for just the second time in Super Bowl history
No doubt the Panthers Newton is a singular talent but if the Broncos defense can rattle the quarterback in his first time on this big of a stage then it gives Denver an opportunity A balanced Broncos offense supplemented by turnovers forced by the defense  particularly early on  is the recipe for Broncos success in Super Bowl 50
