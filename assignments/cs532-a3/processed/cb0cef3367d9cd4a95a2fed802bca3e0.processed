Moments into the first Democratic debate not beleaguered by the presence of Martin OMalley Clinton laid into her remaining opponent Bernie Sanders
Sanders has tried to paint Clinton the former secretary of state and first lady as a representative of the establishment he rails against He often notes sometimes without using Clintons name that she has taken millions in contributions from Wall Street and pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from banks
