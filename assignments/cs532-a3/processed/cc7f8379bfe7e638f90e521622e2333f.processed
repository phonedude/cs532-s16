picks Disagree Tweet us at Billboard with your commentsSuper Bowl 2015 All of Our Coverage10 Michael Jackson 1993Eager to keep viewers glued to their televisions the NFL whipped up the Biggest Freaking Halftime Show Ever starring Michael Jackson The King of Pop whipped viewers into a frenzy with a lipsynched medley of Jam Billie Jean and Black or White MJ then cued up a snippet of We Are The World as the crowd turned over cards revealing drawings by the children of Los Angeles And just in case viewers missed his message of harmony MJ concluded with Heal the World while surrounded by 3500 youngsters as a blowup globe deployed on the 50 yard line9 Aerosmith N Sync amp Britney Spears 2001Through Steven Tylers musical career has been recently sidelined by a stream of band and personal issues he and Aerosmith were firstround picks back in 2001 Besides the shows hardrocking headliners 2001s epic halftime opened with N Syncs Bye Bye Bye The two bands traded songs and verses until the stage exploded with the addition of Britney Spears Mary J Blige and Nelly for a showstopping rendition of Walk This Way8 Paul McCartney 2005A purported safe choice by the NFL following the previous years Nipplegate McCartney signaled the transition from contemporary pop acts to older rock gods performing at halftime Atop an Xshaped stage made of video projectors the Beatle first warmed up with Drive My Car He then followed up with Get Back before trading his guitar for a piano during a fireworksladen rendition of the Wings Bond theme Live and Let Die Saving his best for last McCartney signed off with Hey Jude during which the 84000 in attendance at Jacksonvilles Alltel Stadium all joined in for the iconic coda7 Janet Jackson amp Justin Timberlake 2004It was the day that the phrase wardrobe malfunction entered the American vernacular Debate about whether Justin Timberlake accidentally or accidentally exposed Janets little Jackson has raged since that Houston halftime FCC fines have been assessed thrown out and appealed in judicial court and the court of popular opinon will be in sessions for years But bedazzled breast or not you have to admit that JampJ put on a pretty kickass show Its a shame all anyone remembers is the last two seconds6 The Rolling Stones 2006Considering the fact that the veteran Brits are behind one of the bestknown kickoff jams Start Me Up it was natural that the Rolling Stones featured the hit which reached No 2 on the Hot 100 in 1981 during their 2006 halftime show On a stage built to look like the Stones iconic lips logo Mick and cos 12minute set was rounded out by Rough Justice and the classic I Cant Get No Satisfaction But in the postwardrobemalfunction halftime world the NFL opted for a fivesecond tape delay that allowed censors to mute parts of Start Me Up and Rough Justice deemed too sexually explicitNEXT Beyonc Madonna Prince amp More5 Beyonc 2013After her silhouette was lit on fire Beyonce emerged from a cloud of smoke with an inspired display of hits including Love on Top and Crazy in Love and multimedia indulgence during her Super Bowl XLVII halftime show performance And that was all before Destinys Childs longrumored reunion commenced when Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams shot out from under the stage like pistons to join Bey for Bootylicious Independent Women and Single Ladies During Beyonces reign on the halftime stage she was also backed by dozens of female dancers and band members including a killer horn section and innovative animation screens with duplicate Beys running wild PHOTOS4 Bruce Springsteen amp the E Street Band 2009In 2009 the Boss beckoned viewers to step away from the guar and put the chicken fingers down before proceeding to rock Tampa for the next 12 minutes Though Bruce turned down several prior invitations to perform at the Super Bowl Springsteens set was proof that good things come to those that wait The EStreet Band rocked through a foursong set of crowd favorites but the biggest hit came when Jerseys finest slammed into a TV camera with his crotch during 10th Avenue Freeze Out3 Madonna 2012Riding a huge buzz for her thenforthcoming album MDNA Madonna charged into her Super Bowl XLVI halftime performance as the quasigladiatorial captain of a cheerleading squad that included LMFAO Nicki Minaj MIA and Cee Lo Green Amid Roman soldiers Madge entered the field on a golden throne to belt out longtime favorite Vogue before being joined by LMFAO for a Party Rock AnthemSexy And I Know It infused take on her 2000 hit Music Sure the Material Girl slipped a bit while dancing in those thighhigh heeled boots but her Super Bowl gigs most talked about moment when MIA and Minaj joined her for new single Gimme Your Luvin It happened fast but everyone watching at home certainly saw MIAs mischievous middle finger However Madges epic Like A Prayer finale aided by Cee Lo and large robed choir ensured that the 12minute spectacle ended with the focus right back on the music PHOTOS2 U2 2002Less than five months after the tragedies of September 11 U2 brought the heartshaped stage from their Elevation tour to the gridiron The band kicked off with Beautiful Day but it was their 911 tribute that captured the most attention As they played Where the Streets Have No Name a scrolling backdrop featured the names of all of the victims who perished in the attacks and Bono finished the song by opening his jacket to reveal the stars and stripes in its lining1 Prince 2007Long known for eroticallycharged performances Prince was a curious halftime choice only three years postNipplegate While he did wield that purple unpronounceablesymbolshaped guitar in an unabashedly phallic way the ecstatic genius of Princes performance was the way he actually played the instrument The rocker powered through his own classics 1999 Lets Go Crazy and the classics of others Proud Mary All Along the Watchtower But the explosive coda was Purple Rain which had the stadium full of testosteronepumped football fanatics waving their arms and howling in falsetto
