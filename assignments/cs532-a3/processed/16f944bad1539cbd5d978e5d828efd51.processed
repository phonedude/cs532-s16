Ernie Davis a superb football player was living his dream as a rookie in the NFL Before he played one game of professional football he declared ineligible due to NFL doctors discovering Lukemia The movie takes a look back over his life and how he made it to the NFL 


A few Themes from the Movie

Determination

The movie starts off with Ernie around age nine When in the wrong section of town collecting bottles Ernie was faced by a   mob of white boys demanding he and his cousin Will give up there bottles or take a beat down Will ran Ernie on the other hand faced the boys detemined to get away He out ran the mob and kept his bottles 

Talent

The Heisman Trophy winner was a natural on the football feild With football coming to him naturally his talent eventually led him to Syracuse University and then the Cleveland Browns 

Fearlessness

It is safe to say that Ernie never backed down from a challenge When he first arrived to Syracuse an upper classmen made it clear he did not like Ernie This was done with a cheap shot passed off as a tackle Ernie returned with a same tactic

In closing The Express is a movie about having fulfilled your dream but not having a chance to enjoy it
