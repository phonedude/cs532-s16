				     nbspMorgan McCloyNPR           Which beer goes with guacamole And which brew adds a nice clean crisp finish to spicy wings Those are burning questions for anyone who wants to take his snack game to the next level this Super Bowl weekend And two craft beer experts who wrote the book on pairing have the answers Beer and food have loads of flavors in common and they can complement each other beautifully But most of us are just swigging and chewing mindlessly missing an opportunity to appreciate interactions between the two according to Julia Herz and Gwen Conley authors of Beer Pairing The Essential Guide From The Pairing Pros published in December  We want you to think about what the elements of beer are before tasting the food Conley tells us In the same vein when you taste your food do that exact same process Be involved in it be a participant instead of just being unconscious about it Herz is the craft beer program director of the Brewers Association Conley is a former microbiologist who is now the director of production and quality assurance at Port BrewingThe Lost Abbey in San Marcos Calif They teamed up for the book after years of running public beer and food tastings together Their guide includes everything from how to structure a tasting session to how aromas play into interactions between beer and food Trying to describe pairing is like describing color to a blind person How can a blind person know what youre talking about if they have no reference to that color So if Im pairing and enjoying food and drink as art forms then I want to be able to articulate what Im getting Herz says The interactions and the concepts in this book  a lot of people have never seen them documented in a way that allows them to verbalize it because the terminology is all over the board We wanted to finally provide some lexicon But you shouldnt just throw any beer at any Super Bowl snack and expect a touchdown We asked Conley and Herz to tell us which beer styles would go well with quintessential Super Bowl menu items Heres the rundown Beef Chili  Imperial Double IPA The pale malt in the beer goes with browned meat hops add herb notes that enhance the chilis flavor Guacamole  Hoppy American Pale Ale Citrus notes in the pale ale go with lime in the guacamole and toasted malt matches up with corn chips  Buffalo Wings  BohemianStyle Pilsner Hops in the beer cut the grease in the wings The beers slight sweetness also cuts the heat in wings and offers a crisp clean finish Cool Ranch Doritos  Imperial Red Ale  Caramel malt in the beer brings out the chips sweetness Hops in the beer can also help enhance herb notes in the chips Pizza  GermanStyle Pilsner  The beers bitterness goes with the gooey cheese and the grahamcracker flavor of the malt pairs with the pizza crust Most beer and food pairings go one of three ways Herz and Conley write Theres the home run one plus one doesnt just equal three  it equals five the middleoftheroad matchup not going to be remembered and talked about and the train wreck one plus one equals  negative one One example of the home run they say is the classic matchup of a Belgian dubbel ale with barbecue As for a train wreck Conley says she recently tried dark chocolatecovered pumpkin seeds with an imperial stout The roasted bitter characteristics of the chocolate clashed so bad with the stout and created an ashtray burnt characteristic says Conley Another wreck a saison running into Wensleydale cheese with cranberries Conley explains That can create a massive soapy taste  a terrible train wreck in your mouth But Conley and Herz also urge tasters not to fear train wrecks Such unfortunate pairings they write can be amazing learning experiences Some More Tips To get the most out of your pairings Herz and Conley say youll need to cover some basics  Scents  Make sure there are no scented candles or lingering aromas around particularly perfumes colognes or lotions Temperature  If you keep your beer ice cold or even at the more common 38 degrees let it warm up for 10 minutes or more before tasting Glasses  Use smaller drinking glasses if you have them Just 23 ounces of beer can be enough for each round of a tasting  The important thing Herz and Conley say is to focus on the process of tasting both your beer and your food Analyze their color and intensity savor the aroma and name the flavors youre experiencing Give yourself time between each bite or sip to pick up any lingering flavors It really is a very zen thing says Conley You are concentrating on what youre doing tasting and smelling Seeking that ideal and meditating on the interplay of flavors might end up being even more rewarding than watching the game Like they say about sports its all about how you play  Copyright 2016 NPR   Stay Informed The news on your schedule from MPR News Update       Email Address     Zip Code
