Bernie Sanders Democratic Senate colleagues have pretty much left him alone throughout his presidential run Most of them saw his campaign as quirky and idealistic certainly no threat to the candidate they overwhelmingly back Hillary Clinton
But now after his nearupset in Iowa and an expected victory next week in New Hampshire its beginning to look like open season on Sanders for Senate DemocratsStory Continued Below

    
        
        



 Theyre criticizing his platform as naive taking exception to his criticism of Clinton as a fake progressive and imploring the media to put the Vermont independent and selfdescribed democratic socialist under the microscope
quotYou need to start asking him questions about his plans and his background said Sen Jeanne Shaheen DNH Ask how hes going to address foreign policy and national security how hes going to pay for his higher education and health care proposals There are a lot of unanswered questions
Shaheen has begun making that argument in her home state as New Hampshire prepares for another referendum between Clinton and Sanders And shes being joined by a growing group of Sanders critics after he made the claim Wednesday on Twitter and the campaign trail that Clinton is a progressive some days yes Other days she announces she is a moderatequot

Hillary Clinton is a progressive and I dont think any other progressive gets to judge  and be the gatekeeper of progressivism said Sen Brian Schatz DHawaii who won a 2014 Senate primary running as the more liberal candidate We need to remember who our real adversary is and thats the tea party and what theyve done to the country
Some went further saying Sanders who caucuses with Democrats but identifies as independent isnt really a Democrat
quotHillarys a progressive in the way she views the issues every dayquot said liberal Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif Bernies a Democrat some days And thats a fact with evidence 
The number of Democratic senators willing to insert themselves in the increasingly divisive contest for the Democratic contest remains slim despite the fact that 39 of the caucuss 46 members have endorsed Clinton But it is growing
Even members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus of which Sanders is the only Senate member bristled at his attempts to label Clinton
quotI certainly think she is progressive enough One could ask progressive enough for whatquot said Rep Karen Bass DCalif quotAlthough there are a lot of positions that Senator Sanders has that I agree with in theory I also believe that we are not going to get them done in this current political environmentquot
For months Sen Claire McCaskill DMo seemed to be the only Democratic senator who would say what much of the caucus was thinking That Sanders is unelectable in a general election and has not been fully vetted by the voters Now she says more and more lawmakers will be speaking out
The Missouri Democrat who found herself on Clintons bad side after endorsing President Barack Obama in 2008 says her colleagues are not happy that they keep getting lumped into the quotestablishmentquot whenever Sanders dings Clinton for her long Democratic Party ties and deep party backing

All of us are laughing going like How did we become establishment McCaskill said Ive been fighting the establishment my whole life It feels weird that theyre dismissing all of the senators that are supporting Hillary Clinton by kind of lumping us into some category that most of us find distressing and unfair
Sen Tammy Baldwin DWis said the backing of 13 female senators shows that Clintons support isnt establishmentquot After all she said they are 13 of just 46 women senators to have served in the history of the chamber a case Baldwin made to Iowa voters last month while campaigning for Clinton
The backlash to Sanders Wednesday comments and his establishment jabs coincides with more targeted criticisms of the Vermont independent Prominent immigration activist Astrid Silva endorsed Clinton over Sanders this week prompting a Sanders spokeswoman to dismiss the endorsement as little other than a press hit
That raised the eyebrows of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid DNev who has remained neutral in the primary but felt compelled to respond 
Nobody needs to attack her this little girl that came across the river in a boat with a doll and rosary beads Im not going to let anybody mess with her no matter who it is Very personal for me nobody will mess with Astrid Ill fight back Reid said in an interview
Then theres foreign policy where Sanders has said he would seek to normalize relations with Iran as much as he can This strikes many colleagues as unrealistic
Youre never going to have a normal relationship  theyre openly hostile to us they openly finance attacks against Americansquot said Sen Ben Cardin DMd the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and a Clinton backer 
Despite the sharper criticism from some lawmakers the Democratic caucus is split over how hard to go after Sanders if at all Many lawmakers believe that attacking Sanders could divide the party at a time when unity against Republicans is needed

I dont plan on pointing out negative things about Bernie said Sen Sherrod Brown DOhio
Yet the fact that Sanders has not received a single endorsement from his Senate colleagues  and has just two House endorsements  speaks volumes Clinton supporters say From the liberal Brown to the moderate Joe Manchin the caucus is nearly united for Clinton 
Sanders supporters want quotto dismiss the fact that none of his colleagues have endorsed him but you cant McCaskill said He hasnt had the ability to get consensus or lead people
