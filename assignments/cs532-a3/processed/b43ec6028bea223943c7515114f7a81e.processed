              Nachos are nice pregame fare But for those interested in more substantial Super Bowl cooking for those who want to meet the game with gustatory violence to match what is happening on the field nothing less than loaded nachos will do  the cheese and chips accompanied by a fragrant meat sauce the fire of jalapeos the chill and silkiness of sour cream the tart excellence of a good tomato decent shredded lettuce thinsliced radishes Here is avocado there the awesome funk of chopped cilantroWant some bacon on there as well or a slash of hot sauce Go to Some will add beans Others black olives chopped raw onion Please doBut take care to layer well Layering is the key to loaded nacho perfection
