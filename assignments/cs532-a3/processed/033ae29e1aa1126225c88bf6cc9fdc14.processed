    The Senate will vote next week on legislation to crack down on North Korea after the country said it tested a hydrogen bombSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said the Senate will take up sanctions legislation on Feb 10 and have a final vote after up to seven hours of debateIts avery important piece of legislation that Im pleased to say the whole Senate thinks ought to be taken up and voted on and passed and it will be an important change in our policy toward this rogue regime the Republican leader said after setting up the voteThe move comes after Sens Bob Corker RTenn and Ben Cardin DMd the top two members of the Foreign Relations Committeesuggestedthat the Senate would take up the legislation next weekThe committee approved the legislation by voice vote last month after lawmakers worked to combine legislation from Sens Robert Menendez DNJ and Lindsey Graham RSC with a proposal from Sen Cory Gardner RColoThe Senate legislation goes further than a House billthat passed in JanuaryUnder the Senate proposal the Obama administration is required to sanctionanyone involved with North Koreas nuclear weapons program armsrelated materials luxury goods human rights abuses activities that negatively impact cybersecurity and the use of coal or metals in any of the activitiesPenalties would include freezing assets under US jurisdiction banning individuals from traveling to the United States or blocking government contractsMcConnells move will also help the legislation avoid any potential landmines that could pop up if a senator tried to offer a controversial amendmentsimilar to what happened when the Senate debated legislation allowing Congress to review the Iran nuclear dealCardin voiced concern that socalled poison pill amendments could get attached to the otherwise uncontroversial proposalThe question is what happens on the floor of the Senate he told The Hill last week I think Senator Corker and I can defend the bill on North Korea but if it gets into other areas you never know
