In 2006 the Bears defensive efforts failed to match the success of their 2005 season Nevertheless the team was still a notable presence in league finishing with the leagues third ranked and conferences topranked points allowed category4 The defenses success earned Rivera recognition among franchises looking for new head coaches The Arizona Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers interviewed him in January 2007 He was a candidate for the vacant Dallas Cowboys head coaching position a job that ultimately went to San Diego Chargers defensive coordinator Wade Phillips Rivera was named as a potential candidate to replace the fired Marty Schottenheimer in San Diego but the job was filled by Norv Turner the brother of fellow offensive coordinator Ron Turner Riveras offensive counterpart in Chicago567 After the announcement ESPN reported that the Bears were considering letting Rivera go This came after several other teams interviewed him and the negotiations between his representatives and the Bears were making little progress8 On February 19 2007 it was announced that Ron Riveras contract with the Bears would not be renewed9
San Diego ChargersEdit
The San Diego Chargers hired Rivera as teams inside linebackers coach after he left the Bears10 On October 28 2008 Rivera was promoted to defensive coordinator with the Chargers after the team released former defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell11 Rivera had used the 43 defense for most of his coaching career but adopted a 34 scheme with the Chargers
Carolina PanthersEdit
On January 11 2011 Rivera was named the fourth head coach of the Carolina Panthers He is the fifth Latino to be an NFL head coach following former New Orleans Saints coach Tom Fears former Oakland Raiders and Seattle Seahawks coach Tom Flores former New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts coach Jim E Mora and former Atlanta Falcons coach Jim L Mora
During his first year as head coach the Panthers went 610 and finished third in the division In 2012 the Panthers finished 79 and finished second in the division Following the 2012 season Rivera was expected to be fired12
Over the first 34 games of his coaching career he was known for exceptionally conservative decisionmaking that led to a 214 record in games decided by less than a touchdown Against the Buffalo Bills in Week 2 Rivera decided to kick a field goal while up 3 points and facing a fourth and one deep inside the Bills territory late in the fourth quarter The Bills proceeded to drive for a touchdown on their next drive scoring on a touchdown pass with less than 20 seconds remaining in the game13 With Carolina opening the 2013 season 02 reports circled that the front office was already performing background checks on new potential head coach candidates Rivera then changed his coaching philosophy and became a more aggressive coach13 Facing a 4th and 1 from the two yard line in the first quarter against the also 02 New York Giants in Week 3 Rivera went for the touchdown instead of a field goal A Mike Tolbert run found the end zone and Carolina ended up winning the game 38013
Over the next five games the Panthers went for a first down five times in situations where conventional strategy called for a field goal attempt They converted on four of them and ended each of those drives with touchdowns all in wins The lone failure was against the Cardinals when Brandon LaFell dropped a wide open pass across the middle from Cam Newton that would have resulted in a sure touchdown as well This sudden aggression in his playcalling earned Rivera the nickname Riverboat Ron after Riverboat gamblers14 Rivera has expressed discontent with the nickname however explaining he is a calculated risk taker not a gambler15 Nonetheless he has since embraced the nickname his Twitter nickname is RiverboatRonHC The Panthers went 111 to finish the season including a thenfranchise record eightgame winning streak to win the NFC South title and make the playoffs for the first time since 2008 Rivera was honored as the 2013 AP NFL Coach of the Year
In Riveras fourth season as the Panthers coach Carolina recovered from a 381 start to win its final four regular season games and clinch the NFC South championship for the second consecutive year The Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 2716 in the NFC Wild Card playoff game for the teams first playoff win since 2005
The teams momentum would continue in 2015 Rivera led the Panthers to the best season in franchise history and one of the best regular seasons in NFL history The Panthers started the season 140 easily the best regularseason start in franchise history They ultimately finished 151 their only loss in wk 16 in Atlanta to the Falcons 2013 a franchise record for wins in a season to clinch homefield advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time in franchise history They defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Playoffs by a score of 3124 and routed the Arizona Cardinals with a 4915 victory in the NFC Championship Game leading the Panthers to their second Super Bowl appearance Rivera is the fifth man of color to lead a team to the Super Bowl He was also recognized as the 2015 AP NFL Coach of the Year his second such honor of his career
