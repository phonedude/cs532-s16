Wings Fit For the Superbowl Spread

Superbowl season is upon us and wings are in the airnbsp
Chicken wings that isnbsp

Years back I drove the loooooooong distance to Catonsville from DC and I know I know tiniest violin in the world soak up the Superbowl with KoKo and his tribe But memories and blogs being what they are we can relive the excitement of these wings with a simple repost No driving no cooking for me involved

Comments



These wings tasted just like ones you would get from your local Wings n Things but somehow better because you made them yourself The down side of making them at home is the sheer quantity of vegetable oil required to fry them about 34 to 1 gallon of oil I would only use pure vegetable corn or other neutral high flash point oil definitely not peanut or olive oil to fry these wings You can save the oil to fry at most two more 8220batches8221 of wings but man it8217s not saving any corn
