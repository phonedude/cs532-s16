				The Super Bowl Indicator is a superstition that says that the stock markets performance in a given year can be predicted based on the outcome of the Super Bowl of that year It was discovered by Leonard Koppett in the 70s when he realized that it had never been wrong until that point This pseudomacroeconomic concept states that if a team from the American Football Conference AFC wins then it will be a bear market or down market but if a team from the National Football Conference NFC or a team that was in the NFL before the NFLAFL merger it will be a bull market up market

Accuracyedit
As of January 2015 the indicator has been correct 39 out of 48 times as measured by the SampP 500 Index  a success rate of 8112 However since a particular football league winning a Super Bowl and the US Stock market have no real connection this is just a coincidence Therefore there is no reason to expect it will work as a predictor of future bull markets3
