their first oneonone debate Hillary Clinton accused Bernie Sanders Thursday night of subjecting her to an quotartful smearquot while Sanders suggested the former secretary of state was a captive of America39s political establishmentThe two Democrats embraced a markedly more contentious tone than when they last debated before the year39s presidential voting began in Iowa and it signaled how the race for the nomination has tightened five days ahead of the firstinthenation primary in New Hampshire next TuesdayThe two argued over ideas over tactics and over who has the liberal credentials to deliver on an agenda of better access to health care more affordable college fighting income inequality and moreIt was Clinton who was the main aggressor saying Sanders could never achieve his ambitious and costly proposals Then she took after the Vermont senator for his efforts to cast her as beholden to Wall Street interests because of the campaign donations and speaking fees she39s accepted from the financial sectorquotIt39s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying outquot she saidSanders for his part suggested Clinton39s loyalties were colored by a reliance on big corporate donorsquotSecretary Clinton does represent the establishmentquot he said quotI represent mdash I hope mdash ordinary AmericansquotClinton may say the right things he suggested but quotone of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but walk the walkquotquotI am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have super PAC who39s not raising huge sums from Wall Street and special interestsquot he saidWhere Clinton aimed considerable criticism at Sanders the Vermont senator focused much of his fire on what he says is a political system rigged against ordinary AmericansHe said that when a quotkid gets caught with marijuana that kid has a police recordquot But when quota Wall Street executive destroys the economyquot and pays a 5 billion settlement he has no criminal recordquotThat is what power is about that is what corruption is aboutquot he saidClinton unwilling to cede the issue to Sanders insisted her regulatory policies would be tougher on Wall Street than hisquotI39ve got their numberquot she said quotthe Wall Street guysquotAsked if she would release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street interests and others Clinton was noncommittal saying quotI39ll look into itquot She had struggled a day earlier to explain why she accepted 675000 for three speeches from Goldman SachsClinton called Sanders39 sweeping proposals on health care and education quotjust not achievablequot while Sanders countered that Clinton was willing to settle for less than Americans deserveThe race for the Democratic nomination once seen as a sure thing for Clinton intensified this week after Sanders held the former secretary of state to a whisperthin margin of victory in Iowa39s leadoff caucuses The tone of their backandforth has become increasingly sharp and the candidates agreed to add four more debates to the primary season schedule including Thursday39s faceoff in DurhamIn fresh evidence of the tightening race Clinton reported that her campaign had raised 15 million in January mdash 5 million less than Sanders and the first time she39s been outraised by her opponent Her finance director called the numbers quota very loud wakeup callquotSanders has a big lead in New Hampshire polls but he was eager to lower expectations for his finish there casting himself as an underdogClinton for her part signaled her determination to at least narrow the gap before Tuesday39s vote Her prospects are much stronger in primaries and caucuses after New Hampshire as the race moves on to states with more diverse electorates that are to her advantageThe two renewed their running debate over who is the real progressive with Clinton accusing Sanders of quoting her selectively to diminish her credentialsOn foreign policy Sanders renewed his criticism of Clinton for her vote as a senator to authorize the war in Iraq a vote she later said was a mistakeClinton retorted quotA vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS We have to look at the threats that we face right nowquotSanders allowed that while Clinton had been secretary of state quotexperience is not the only point Judgment isquotOn a nagging issue Clinton was asked if she was sure nothing problematic would come of the ongoing investigation into her use of a private email account and server to handle official messages when she was secretary of state some of them later classified as top secretquotI am 100 percent confidentquot she saidWhen the fireworks had died out at the end of two hours the two candidates had some conciliatory words for one another with Sanders declaring quoton our worst days I think it is fair to say we are 100 percent better than any Republican candidatequotThe Durham debate was the first faceoff for Clinton and Sanders since former Maryland Gov Martin O39Malley dropped out of the race after a poor showing in IowaThe close result in Iowa was the latest twist in an election campaign that until recently had been dominated by the crowded and cacophonous field of Republicans who spread out across New Hampshire this weekDonald Trump who finished second in Iowa stepped up the pace of his campaign and acknowledged he should have had a stronger ground operation in Iowa Jeb Bush his campaign lagging brought in his mom former first lady Barbara Bush who praised him as quotdecent and honest and everything we need in a presidentquot___Benac reported from Washington Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman in Washington and Scott Bauer contributed from Madison Wisconsin___Follow
