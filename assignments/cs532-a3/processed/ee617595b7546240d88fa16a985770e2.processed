Americans who tuned in for the glitz and grandeur of last years Super Bowl adswere instead forcefeda sad smorgasbord Abused wivesand lost dogs cyberbullying and overeating even an insurance commercialwherea dead boy dreamed ofall the things hed never do But this year advertisers at Americas mostwatchedsporting event are swapping out the pall forwhat made the spectacleso popular in the first place Cutepuppies in costumes zany sight gagsand a parade of celebrities designednot to remind viewers of the worlds problems but to distract from them with fireworks If Super Bowl ads mirrorwhat corporate Americathinks the country wants to see right now one thing is clear We could all use a laugh Or at the very least a break from adispiriting news cycle and doomandgloompolitical season that hasfilled commercialswith foreign terrorists and domesticdread So on Sundayviewers returning to the TV gridiron after last years Somber Bowl will probably finda newly shinyhappy and ceaselessly upbeatadvertising universe in whichthe only political party is theBud Light Party and everyone makes it out of the adalive People dontreally care about all these weighty issues when  theyresitting around drinking a brew and eating chips saidRichard Kirshenbaum a longtime ad executive and chief of Manhattanad agency NSGSWATThey want to be entertainedThey love seeing the Super Bowl iconic ad work the Clydesdales thecelebrities They love sex They love a goodjoke Mostlythey just want to have some fun Watch all the 2016 Super Bowl ads released so far The feelgoodrenaissance of the Super Bowl ad executivessay was a conscious creative decisiondesigned towin back viewers fatigued by despairand eagerto laugh and buy again Election years are guaranteed to swim inmudslinging attacks and commercial bummersthis year has certainly delivered including with ads for Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio that detailhow ISISis beheading people and burning them in cages The present is a pretty scary time  San Bernardino Paris the stock market cratering They all have left opena market for escapism in entertainment said Brad Todd a Republican admaker and media strategist Political campaignsareresponding and perhaps contributing tothat angst withalarmingTVmontages but companies aregoing 180 degrees in the other direction because theyre hoping viewers are looking for an escape Telling jokesat Americas biggestcampfire doesnt come cheap The averagecostto air a30second Super Bowl ad has doubled since 2008 to about 5 million But companies who land a gag during theSundaymatchupofthe Carolina Panthers andDenver Broncos are guaranteeda viewership that most companies can only dream ofLast years game drewan average of114 million viewers the biggest audience in TV history The bowl last year quickly became infamous for its unrelenting pageant of depressing scenes Nissans ad played Cats in the Cradle over the taleof an absent fatherwho missed his sons

about nightmares Some ads even went apocalyptic Phoneaccessory maker Mophies ad centeredonafinal reckoningof tsunamis and looting all because Gods phone battery diedBut the biggestbuzzkill came fromNationwidewhose grim tableauof the way children die frompreventable accidents as one executivesaidsucked the oxygen out of every Super Bowl party in America The pendulum shifted away from these humorous ads to where the brands all piled on with theseinspirational emotional messages  which is fine except when youvegot 10 of them doing it said Peter Daboll chief executive of Ace Metrix an advertising analyticsfirmIt gotso heavy last year that by the end you just wanted to see you know chimps in a car or something No apes have hit the roadin any of the corporate campaigns revealedin the days before kickoff but virtually all of the ads released so farhave been bubbly agreeableand troublefreeDachshunds in hotdog costumes run majestically across aprairie for Heinz condiments Dan Marino and Alec Baldwinplan a raucous partywith help from the Amazon EchoAxe themens groomingbrand swaps out its typical call to machismo for an ode to selfesteem asking Who needs a sixpack when you got the nose    Helen Mirren warns against drunk driving in Budweisers Super Bowl ad Budweiser   Even the calls to serious topics are fringed with humor ABudweiser antidrunkdriving adstarsHelen Mirren a selflabelednotoriously frank and uncensored British ladyslinging insults at any tipsy viewerwho would dare pick up the keysSo far the lone reference to politics has involved comedians Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen yanking on Spanx to represent what their campaign pins callthe Bud Light Party Helen Mirren elegantly eviscerates drunk drivers in Budweisers Super Bowl ad The starkest shift in tone may come fromthe National Football League itself Last year stained by thedomesticabuse scandals of players Ray Rice and AdrianPeterson the league aired a haunting publicservice announcement in which a woman presumably assaulted by her husband feignsordering a pizza while calling911 This year the NFLs ad focuses onsinging choirs of Super Bowl babies conceived in the afterglow oftheir parents teamvictories    The NFL celebrates all the children that were possibly results of a hometowns Super Bowl victory in an extended version of the ad that will air during the big game NFL   Plenty of selfserious ads have found success at the big game Perhaps the most famous Apples 1984 ad depicted modern civilization as a brainwashed dystopiaBut viewers of Americasbiggest advertising juggernaut have often blanched at ads that are too preachy or dolefulANational Retail Federation survey last year found that 77 percent of Americans sawSuper Bowl ads asentertainmentwhile only 10 percent said they influence me to buy the advertisersstuff Going lightheartedmayofferanadded buzzbuilding benefit for advertisersin the age ofsocial mediaMany companies analysts said believe its easier topersuade viewers to share their ads with something cute like scampering wiener dogs rather than a reminder of their own mortality How House Hunters became the most unstoppable juggernaut on TV Opting for a highspiritedad bringsits own risks Namely paying for a 30second joke thats notactuallyfunny or that creates just as many problems as an overly wrought tearjerkerspot Funny is a strange thing Itsvery subjective Daboll said If you makean ad that appeals to a 14yearoldMountain Dewdrinker theres a good chance thats going tooffend their parents in some way But at the very least a cheerier touchwill help the companies separate themselves from the dark and dreary landscapes of political adsAnd thats a good thing ad execs say The companies arenttrying to run a countryso why not have some fun They cant solve the problems facing us with a consumer product said Todd the Republican admaker You cant stop ISIS with a beer  Drew Harwell is a national business reporter at The Washington Post       The
