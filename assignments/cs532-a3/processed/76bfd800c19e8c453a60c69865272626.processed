An estimated 189 million people will tune into Super Bowl 50 this Sunday While the events a great excuse to get together and eat all of the food a whole other tradition may help you and your friends fare better when it comes to happiness and health
This year trade in the pigskin for some puppy fur No not in a sadistic way  were just saying you should be watching the Puppy Bowl on Animal Planet at 3 pm Sunday instead of the Super Bowl Youll reap all of the benefits of a social activity without any of the bad stuff that taints thenbspothernbspbig game
Need a little convincing Below weve outlined 12 reasons why watching the Puppy Bowl is the right thing to do
1 Youll feel instant happiness
Spending time with animals is shown to boost humans happiness and health and just petting a furry friend can reduce stress levelsnbspEven if you dont have a pooch to cuddle up to just looking at cute animalsnbspcan improve your mood and even better your focus The Puppy Bowl is obviously the next best thing to having a pet at home
2 Youll have more time for healthier activities

Youll need two hours to watch the Puppy Bowl in its entirety The Super Bowl on the other hand will have you glued to the tube for about four hours All of that sitting and that many hours of constant snacking isnt good for your body or your brain Why not play fetch outside with your dog instead
3 Youll be able to go to bed on time
The average Super Bowl game ends around 1015 pm eastern timenbspnot counting the postgame coverage likely forcing you to start your prebedtime rituals later in the night and stealing away extra sleep before you start the work weeknbspThat could throw off your whole week Theres no late night with the Puppy Bowl which ends at a solid 5 pm ESTnbsp
4 You wont be cheering on injuries or concussions

Tail wags squeaky barks and fine a little nibbling are the only risk factors here
5 You and your friends will be on the same team
Team Dog
6 You can adopt a player

Animal Planet coordinated with more than 40 animal shelters and rescue organizations across the country to make up this years two Puppy Bowl teams So in essence youre making the world a better place by watching this beloved sporting event and bonus research shows youre also boosting your own wellbeing through such an act of kindness Could you say the same for football
7 And you can still catch Beyonce

As mentioned above the Puppy Bowl will be over in time for the Super Bowl halftime show and isnt that the best part of the Super Bowl anyway Studies show that listening to upbeat music can put you in a happier mood so combine halftime with the joyful boost youll get from the puppies and youllnbspreallynbspbe peppy Also Beyonceacute
8 You can pun up a storm without judgment
Line barkersnbspRufferee What a gas Puns are inherently hilarious and laughter is proven to decrease those pesky stress hormones and can even boost your immune system keeping you healthy all winter longnbsp
9 A bird is covering the event
Hope there is no FOWL play during PuppyBowl Get it TheGeicoGecko Cuz I39m a bird PunFunmdash meepthebird meepthebird February 3 2016

Meepthebird is the official livetweeter of the pawsome show Cant say any human sports announcer has ever been as entertaining as this little fella
10 You might avoid the flu
Seriously A recent study found that Super Bowl parties up the likelihood that youll catch the flu Its not surprising if you think about it Mass amounts of people communal bowls of chips and lots of drinking Pass Were not saying not to serve snacks at your Puppy Bowl viewing but chances are youll be too distracted by the cuteness to share as many germsnbsp
11 All of the players are guaranteed eye candy

Um just look at that face
12 You might reduce your chances for heart attack
Research shows that diehard sports fans are at higher risk for heart attacknbspUnless youre an aggressively staunch supporter of Wrinkles the sharpei and have an emotional investment in his success on the field you likely wont have a health issue watching the Puppy Bowl
The bottom line

Football may be Americas pastime but you certainly cant beat a mans best friend
