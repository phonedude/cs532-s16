All the
world weapons now are in the Middle East rich people are preparing their
passports and poor civilians are preparing their empty stomachs for more
hunger games and more crazy blood

The TV
screens shine with tears and sadness instead of development and hope which they
wait for it a long time millions of innocent children came by mistake to this
sad area of Earth
to die or
live with disability

Hey
friends all over the world

Prays
are not enough to stop the madness in the Middle East we need your loud voice
to support the sound of mind logic and peace Yes we have many strange ideas
which need discussion chance to meditate but surely not war that may begin
here at a time nobody knows where it ends
