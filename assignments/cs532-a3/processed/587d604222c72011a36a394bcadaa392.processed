What can make a Carolina Panthers team photo before the Super Bowl even better Everyone dabbing Every player and staff member Wait a minute 
Its ALMOST perfect There is one tiny flaw
Enhance
  
      
        
        
          
      
  
  
      
        
        
          
      
  
  
      
        
        
          
      
  

Star Lotulelei isnt dabbing 
Even Greg Olsen who infamously didnt dab in a teamwide dab is doing it Get with the program Lotulelei Maybe hes just very focused on Sundays game No time to play around
There are actually a few players who didnt dab Theres also a staff member thats doing something that quite cant be described as a dab
