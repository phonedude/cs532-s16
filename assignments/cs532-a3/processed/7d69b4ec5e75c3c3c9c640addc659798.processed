Super Bowl 50 8211 What8217s the plot Who is going to win






















The Super Bowl is one of the biggest sporting events in the world It8217s certainly the biggest sporting event in the United States This year the game is between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers and will be held at 630 on Sunday February 7 and televised on CBS Watching any football game is more fun if you understand who the key characters are and what compelling plots and subplots there are It also helps to know some of the basic rules of how football works Dear Sports Fan is here to help you with both For learning the basics of football start with Football 101 and work up to Football 201 To learn about the characters and plot read on and stay tuned for more posts throughout the week
What8217s the plot of Super Bowl 50
The Panthers are expected to win For a Super Bowl which matches the top seeds in each conference or half of the NFL and therefore should be a relatively even matchup this belief is remarkably widely held One way of telling this is to look at the line Vegas set for the game and what happened to it If you8217re not someone who understands football betting this post provides good background The line opened was first set with Carolina as a three point favorite suggesting that Vegas thought Carolina was three points better than Denver Over the two weeks between when this line was set and now so many people bet so much money on Carolina that they actually moved the line so that Carolina was favored by five or five and a half points Remember that the goal of a linesetter is to get half the money on each team so that no matter who wins the bookies can basically pay the winners on one side with money from the losers on the other and pocket the transaction fees from both sides When too much money comes in on one side like it did for Carolina Vegas will move the line so that it8217s more favorable to bet on the team getting fewer bets Even if you think Carolina is going to win the game it8217s much more attractive to bet on them when they only have to win by four points Carolina by three means they need to win by four for a bet on them to pay out than when they have to win by six points for you to win The line moving so far is a sure sign that most people think that Carolina is going to win fairly easily So why are people so sure We8217ll examine the game in two phases 8212 when Denver has the ball and when Carolina does 8212 and try to explain the challenges Denver faces on both sides
Denver8217s offense is likely to struggle against Carolina for one main reason their quarterback Peyton Manning is a shell of his former self Manning is 39 years old nearancient for a football player and he had neck surgery a few years ago This has left him with a severely underpowered arm for an NFL quarterback for a normal person he8217s still a super hero and with little to no feeling in the fingers of his throwing arm That he8217s able to play at all is incredible but it doesn8217t change the fact that his shortcomings will become his team8217s shortcomings Manning finds it difficult to throw deep down the field to his wide receivers Alas that8217s the strength of one of his top two receivers Demarius Thomas who is now less effective More importantly opposing defenses know Manning is less effective throwing downfield than he used to be and they set themselves up accordingly The Panthers who also have one of the best oneonone defenders in the league won8217t waste too many players defending deep passes This leaves them free to concentrate on stopping or limiting the effectiveness of the two other things an offense can do run and pass short Carolina8217s defense is hell on offenses trying to do these things at the best of times but they8217ll be downright Cerberuslike against a team they know can only do these things Carolina has two excellent giant defensive tackles who will disrupt the Broncos running game mostly by making it impossible for Denver8217s offensive line to create clear areas for their running back to sneak through When a running back does sneak through or when the Broncos circumvent the Panthers linemen by completing a short pass the ballcarrier is unlikely to get far because of the Panthers swift linebackers who will flow toward the ballcarrier during this game with a ferocity and speed matched only by you or me headed toward the chip and dip at our Super Bowl parties It8217s hard to imagine Denver scoring many points on offense because it8217s hard to imagine how they8217ll find ways to gain more than five to seven yards on any single play
Denver has made up for their deficits on offense all year by having the best defense in the league Alas for Denver supporters it seems like Carolina was designed specifically to thwart everything Denver is best at on defense Denver excels at attacking their opposition8217s quarterback They8217ve been able to hit tackle sack and fluster almost every quarterback they8217ve come across They haven8217t played anyone like Carolina8217s quarterback Cam Newton though Newton is not only enormous 6821758243 245 lbs but he8217s also a normally unflappable person on the best streak of his career If that weren8217t enough he is also an expert executor of the 8220readoption8221 offense This tactic looks like a normal running play but gives the quarterback the option to look at how the defenders are reacting read them and then decide because they have the option to hand the ball off to the running back or keep it himself and run or throw it At best this tactic slows down opposing defenders At worst it leaves them bewildered and frozen in their tracks Having the readoption in their back pocket and a physical unflappable quarterback to run it will make Carolina resistant to Denver8217s defensive edge rushers Denver has also been able to shut down opposing wide receivers all year with their combination of great defensive backs Unfortunately Carolina8217s best passcatcher is not a wide receiver but a tight end 8212 Greg Olsen Denver did a great job on New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski in their last game but it is an area they8217ve been relatively vulnerable to all year Denver still has a great defense that will find ways to make life hard for Carolina but because of how Carolina8217s offense works they will be less affected than nearly any other team would be
Who is going to win
Usually there8217s more suspense at this point in the post and the football season but given the thrust of this article it8217s hard to generate much The Carolina Panthers are going to win I just hope the Broncos can put up enough of a fight to make the game interesting I think they will Their formidable defense will find ways to frustrate Carolina8217s offense who it must be admitted have not faced much adversity so far this year Given a few lucky bounces and perhaps a lucky injury or two the Broncos could just sneak through and find a way to win in a low scoring game8230 but they won8217t Panthers 22 Broncos 16
