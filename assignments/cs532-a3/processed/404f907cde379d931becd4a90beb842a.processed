Hey y8217all
I8217ve never gotten political on my blog but today I am
This will most likely be the one and only time I post about a specific politician unlessthis politician ends up winning the presidency Then I might write a second post where I write IN CAPS AND EXCLAMATION POINTS AND HEARTS
However I8217m feeling the Bern as I believe Bernie Sanders is one of the most honest hardworking and intelligent presidential candidates America8217s had in a long time and I want to share only just a few reasons as to why I8217m voting forhim
1Bernie believes that black lives matter

2 Bernie was a civil rights activist and organizerin his youth and participated in the 1963 March on Washington
3 When asked about Islamphobia in America by a young Muslim woman Bernie asked her to come down to the stage hugged her and responded with 8220I will do everything I can to rid this country of the ugly stain of racism that has existed here for far too many years8221

4 Bernie believesin police cameras and demilitarizing and diversifyingpolice forces
5 Bernie believes in restoring the Voting Rights Act
6 Bernie wants to make public universities tuitionfree by imposing a Wall Street tax
7Bernie believes in automatically registering all Americansto vote once they turn the age of 18
8 Bernie wants asinglepayer universal health care system

9Bernie 8220filibustered8221 for eightandhalf hours against Bushera tax cuts specifically the provisions that benefited highincome earners
10 In 2015Bernie introduceda bill to raise theminimum wage from 725 to 15 an hour by 2020
11 Bernie wants to invest 1 trillion in fixing our crumbling roads public transit and waste plants which will provide jobs to Americans particularly veterans

12 Bernie wants to reverse NAFTA and bring jobs back to America
13 Bernie believes men and women should be paid equally
14 Bernie wants to expand funding to Planned Parenthood

15 Bernie believes that every employeeshould have 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave two weeks of paid vacation and seven days of paid sick days
16 Berniedoes not ask for money from billionaires or Wall Street He evendonated his check from notoriously douchey pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli to an HIV clinic
17 Because Bernie flies coach

18 Bernie wants to break up big banksand end the practice of paying out big bonuses to CEOs He also wants to reenactGlassSteagall a 1933 act that separated risky trading from conventional banking
19 Bernie has been a supporter of gay rights for decades
20 Because Bernie says things like this

21 Bernie opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq
22Bernie was instrumental in pushing 2014 legislation that added billions of additional dollars to the US Department of Veteran Affairs He also believes in supporting our veterans by offering them excellent health care and getting their benefits to them quickly
23 Bernie believes in the Iran Deal because

24 Bernieis serious about climate change and has a full plan on how he wants to combat it This plan includes transitioning away from fossil fuels and investing in clean energy

nbsp
25 Bernie believes in treating immigrants fairly and humanely while creating a respectful system of legalization he promises to use executive order if Congress prevents him from doing so
And on the fun side he looks like Doc Brown he was mayor of one of the most hippie cities in America Burlington Vermont and he released a folk album

										I8217m a little disappointed in this article It8217s my first time to this blog I really like a few of your other post on medium I think about 7 items on the list are good The rest have pros and cons And quite honestly many have huge hidden cons under what might sound good under the surface Take for instance free college Colleges need to be reformed and made more efficient There are already open courseware programs where MIT and many other universities offer many classes can be taken for free Funding all universities and making them free would not work as well as people making a benifit analysis Education about college choices are much more highly needed Trade programs are quite honest in higher need than free college My main point is not to say it8217s bad it8217s to say many improvements canand need to be made as a prerequisite to making things free I don8217t want to beat up on this post too much because I think your post is sincere8230 It just seems there isn8217t a real understanding of all of the negatives of these positions

										David8217s points are spot on with my own beliefs and the primary reason I will not vote for Bernie College tuition is the largest waste in America right now Universities have been allowed to jack up tuition while all building their own little versions of ancient Rome They are the most inefficient institutions in the world 
I actually worked in a marketing department at one of the largest universities in the country and I can tell you that we had twice as many employees than we needed and our jobs were to promote programs that had no business being pushed to students My own job was pointless and a total waste I very happily resigned when I realized how much of my life I was wasting working for a place that really didn8217t8217 need me Budgets are never audited or scrutinized It8217s ridiculous 
I can not support a man who wants to support such waste with my tax dollars Universities need reform NOW And throwing them more money that8217s backed by the feds and our tax dollars is not the answer 
I8217ve read up on Bernie8217s ideas and most of them are fairly simplistic8230

										Dawn it wouldn8217t be free I suggest you educate yourself on his policies and maybe look up other nations that provide free university and healthcare to their citizens to see the systems they already have in place While you8217re at it consider checking out how American taxpayer money gets mismanaged and run some numbers to see if we can better spend it for the American people and not the richest of the rich
And on the topic of complaining about 8220free stuff8221 well public school is 8220free8221 Should we get rid of that institution Should only children whose parents can pay for them to go to elementary school receive a basic education What about 8220free8221 emergency services Should only people with enough disposable income be able to call the police department or have a fire in their house put out We already provide services to the people 8220for free8221 through their taxes Please spare us your nonsense and get a clue before you return

										Totally agree Come and visit any Northern European country and see that the ideas that Sanders are proposing are working here like clockwork Here in Germany everyone is entitled to health care and university education even in remote areas the public transport system is amazing as is the quality of the roads Everyone is also entitled to 24 days vaccation and both partners are entitled to take up to 14 months when they have a baby In comparison everytime I visit the US I am shocked at the quality of the highways the nonexistent public transport system and the fact that 10 days vaccation is a luxury

										He is marvelous  I saw him in NH and he took time spoke with us not at us  Asked the audience questions and let them answer  If you listen to the language that comes out of the candidates mouths it is such a clear difference  Clinton consistently says when she wins such and  such will happen Bernie says when WE win such and such will happen  As to that ridiculous everything is free charge included with the snarky learn about economics posters here is a link to the pdf of the letter drafted and signed by 170 top economists starting with Bill Clinton8217s Secretary of Labor Robert Reich  Enjoy that plate of crow  httpsberniesanderscomwpcontentuploads201601WallStLetter1pdf
