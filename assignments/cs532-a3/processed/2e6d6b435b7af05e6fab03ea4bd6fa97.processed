White Supremacists More Dangerous To America Than Foreign Terrorists Study Says




06242015 0151 pm ET




























Julia Craven
Politics Reporter The Huffington Post






















Nine people were added to a long list of lives taken by domestic terrorism when Dylann Roof allegedly began shooting inside a historic black church in Charleston South Carolina on June 17
At least 48 people have been killed stateside by rightwing extremists in the 14 years since since the September 11 attacks  almost twice as many as were killed by selfidentified jihadists in that time according to a study released Wednesday by the New America Foundation a Washington DC research center The study found that radical antigovernment groups or white supremacists were responsible for most of the terror attacks
The data counters many conventional thoughts on what terrorism is and isnt Since Sept 11 many Americans attribute terror attacks to Islamic extremists instead of those in the right wing But the numbers dont back up this popular conception said Charles Kurzman a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Kurzman is coauthoring a study with David Schanzer of Duke University set to be published Thursday that asks police departments to rank the three biggest threats from violent extremism in their jurisdiction 
Law enforcement agencies reported they were more concerned about the activities of rightwing extremist groups than Islamic extremists in their jurisdictions about 74 percent versus 39 percent due to the menacing rhetoric used by some of these groups  and that they were training officers to take caution when they saw signs of potentially violent individuals Kurzman and Schanzer found 
Muslim extremism was taken seriously in many of these jurisdictions that we surveyed but overall they did not see as much of an issue with Muslim extremism as with rightwing extremism in their locations Kurzman told The Huffington Post He added that its hard to get a definitive statistical picture of plots and acts of violent extremism since that definition tends to vary and data for incidents nationwide is hard to come by 
The accused Charleston shooter is currently being investigated under domestic terrorism charges by the Department of Justice  a move that acknowledges the long history of antiblack terrorist attacks 
Americas first federal antiterrorism law known as the Third Force Act or the Ku Klux Klan Act which was passed by Congress in 1871 caused nine counties in South Carolina to be placed under martial law and led to thousands of arrests The Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional in 1882
 
David Pilgrim the founder and director of the Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University told HuffPost in February that the actions of foreign extremist groups are no better or worse than the historic violence against AfricanAmericans by domestic actors
Theres nothing youre going to see today thats not going to have already occurred in the US he said If you think of these groups that behead now  first of all beheading is barbaric but its no more or less barbaric than some of the lynchings that occurred in the US
Pilgrim said he found it offensive that after Sept 11 some Americans bemoaned that terrorism had finally breached US borders
That is ignoring and trivializing  if not just summarily dismissing  all the people especially the peoples of color in this country who were lynched in this country who had their homes bombed in this country who were victims of race riots he said evoking lynching victims who were often burned castrated shot stabbed  and in some cases beheaded 
And while most officially acknowledged antiblack terrorism cases occurred during the eras of slavery Reconstruction and Jim Crow as recent news demonstrate this type of terrorism is still an ongoing concern

The Charleston church killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that still taints our nation  This senseless violence fills me with outrage disgust and a deep deep sadness  The hateful killing of nine people praying inside a church is a horrific reminder that while we have made significant progress in advancing civil rights in this country we are far from eradicating racism Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and their congregation

My heart and prayers go out to the entire Charleston community and the families and loved ones of victims in this horrific hate crime as gun violence again grips our nation Mass murder and gun violence have killed children and educators in their Sandy Hook school moviegoers in Colorado and men and women in their workplaces and neighborhoods across America Last night gun violence invaded yet another sacred place  a site of ultimate sanctity and safety We are far beyond saying enough is enough and in danger of being numb to the scourge of gun violence plaguing our country Numbness to gun violence is consummate complicity

Rep John Conyers DMich
The brutal killing of nine innocent AfricanAmericans at the historically black Emmanuel AME Church in South Carolina including pastor and State Senator Clementa Pinckney is an unspeakable and horrific tragedy by any measure  These individuals simply gathered to worship and study the Bible in a sanctuary and place of refuge as they did every week but were senselessly killed  My most heartfelt condolences go out to all of the families and friends of the victims as well as the entire community 
 
It is my hope that all levels of state local and federal law enforcement work together to capture this brutal killer before any more senseless violence occurs  I commend the Department of Justice for their swift determination to open a federal hate crimes investigation

I appreciate the swift engagement by the Department of Justice to monitor the situation and to assist in any way possible  Today we stand with the people of Charleston and with the brave law enforcement officers and agents who are working to bring to justice the person or persons responsible for these heinous acts

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio D
This was an absolutely troubling and heart wrenching moment The fact is that nine innocent lives are lost Our hearts go out to the people of Charleston Our hearts go out to the members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church We in this city feel the pain of people anywhere in this country anywhere in this globe because were so connected to each and every part of the country and the world There are so many people here who hail from South Carolina and its a very very painful moment for all of us I want everyone to know theres no place in New York City for this kind of hatred and that we through the NYPD have increase our resources directed at protecting AfricanAmerican churches in this city as a precaution

Vice President Joe Biden amp Dr Jill Biden
Hate has once again been let loose in an American community And the senseless actions of a coward have once again cut short so many lives with so much promise Our hearts ache with sorrow with the entire Emanuel AME Church family as they seek solace and comfort in the shadow of a gunmans act of pure evil and hatred Our love and prayers are with them

We last saw Reverend Clementa Pinckney less than a year ago at a prayer breakfast in Columbia He was a good man a man of faith a man of service who carried forward Mother Emaunels legacy as a sacred place promoting freedom equality and justice for all We pray for him and his sister as we do for the seven other innocent souls who entered that storied church for their weekly Bible study seeking nothing more than humble guidance for the full lives ahead of them 

We have no doubt the coward who committed this heinous act will be brought to justice But as a nation we must confront the ravages of gun violence and the stain of hatred that continues to be visited on our streets in our schools in our houses of worship and in our communities

As Mayor Riley made clear all of Charlestons heart bleeds todaybut the overwhelming display of unity will bring forth the citys healing We will never forget those innocent souls who lost their lives We will be there with all the strength and support and prayers we can offer to the families who now grieve And as a nation we will come together

I commend law enforcement officials for their work to apprehend the suspect in the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston South Carolina There are no words to express the anguish and shock felt by people across the nation from this massacre As the son of two preachers I know the sanctity and security the church offers for people of faith It is unimaginable that someone would commit such an act of violence in a place of worship that resulted in the loss of nine lives

My prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who were killed and for the Charleston community as they begin the healing process
