    Super Bowl 50 was supposed to be a chance to show off Levis Stadium Instead Super Bowl attendees will walk into a twoyearold stadium that is widely hated by San Francisco 49ers fans while NFL stadium and city planners grit their teeth and hope for the best

It wasnt supposed to be this way Back in the heady days of 2012 it was pitched as ATampT Park to the south a dazzling new theater to showcase all thats best about the Bay Area It hasnt worked out that way
There are caveats of course Anything would feel corporate and sterile after damp windy beersoaked championshipbedecked Candlestick The 49ers are far from the first team to move to the suburbs And Levis does have a lot of stateoftheart amenities wifi good food If your benchmark for judging a stadium is whether its better than the old one then Levis Stadium largely succeeds
But man what a disappointment Shall we count the ways
Theres thenbspscrewedup turf Theres the fact that half the 13 billion stadium is positioned such that anyone sitting there stands a good chance of being baked to death beneath the Santa Clara sun Theres the humdrum reality of having a stadium an hours drive south of the city its team is named for Theres the traffic  oh the traffic  that turns 101 and 280 into parking lots Theres the fact that the actual parking lots around the stadium are somehow worse fewer and more expensive than Candlesticks to the point that the stadium had tonbspbuy overflow parking spots from the neighboring Great America The scoreboardsnbspblind pilots flying into San Jose International
I am never going to be able to please everyone in this room much less the 70000 people in the stadium the 49ers vice president of stadium operations and security said during a 2014 town hall I may never be able to please you and for that I am sorry

  
  
    
  







At times 49ers CEO Jed York and the rest of the Niners leadership have seemed almost pathologically committed to alienating fans This week Levis Stadium made some nonSuper Bowl news the stadium canceled an upcoming Girl Scouts sleepover to hold a more profitable concert instead From thenbspSan Jose Mercury News

The Niners previously had signed a contract to host Girl Scouts from across Northern California as a reward for the girls who sell the most cookies during the fundraising sales season that began this week The girls would be able to run through the stadium tunnel and burst through a banner like the players hang out with 49ers cheerleaders the mascot and the team band watch movies and eat pizza on the 50 yard line and see their names on the Levis Stadium big screen in May

Instead the 49ers canceled on the Girl Scouts  on the Girl Scouts who were there to celebrate selling cookies nbspin favor of the notyetannounced concert which would allow the team to sell thousands of tickets parking permits and concessions Its not even the first PR headscratcher of 2016 in January the team wasnbspsued by a disabled man who was kicked out of the stadium with his service dog in November A local youth soccer league isnbspalso suing after its fields were seized by the NFL for Super Bowl broadcasts
Then there are the fan incidents which have solidified an image of Levis Stadium as an unpleasant if not outright dangerous place to watch football The 2015 season began with a Vikings fan being beaten in the parking lot while a group of Niners fans looked on In 2014 another fan was beaten in a mens room leaving him with severe brain damage
And it hasnt helped that the 49ers  backtobacktoback division champs the first time they took the field at Levis and seemingly on the cusp of a new dynasty  imploded Jim Harbaugh was fired Colin Kaepernick regressed to the mean and most everybody else left San Francisco fans so happily accustomed to ticker tape championship paradesnbspthese days spent this year watching a grim 511 season unfold and they have been something markedly less than optimistic about the hiring of Chip Kelly
Thatnbspburial ground they considered building a parking lot on top of Totally inconsequential Definitely
