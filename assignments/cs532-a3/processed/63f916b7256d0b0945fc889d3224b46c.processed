This weekend thousands of corps members alumni and staff will converge in Washington DC for Teach For America8217s TFA 25th anniversary While it is a time for celebration it is also an opportunity for critics of TFA to debate its value
As one of TFAs charter corps members I may be admittedly quick to defend an organization that not only shaped my career but truly altered the course of my life My experience teaching in South Central Los Angeles ignited a passionor more accurately a furythat continues to this day
But given the crude criticisms launched at TFAespecially that its ulterior motive is schoolsystem privatizationI thought it was a good time to sit down with Wendy Kopp and discuss the origin and vision of TFA
Wendy prioritized teacher diversity from the inception of Teach For America
More than 75 percent of public school teachers are women even more than a decade ago and an even higher percentage is white
What message do we send students when they dont see themselves among those who represent knowledge learning and leadership
TFA is much more diverse than the teaching force overall Nearly 50 percent of this years corps are people of color compared to less than 20 percent in the teaching force as a whole And as is widely known all corps members go through a highlyselective process based on academic success commitment to equality and leadership ability
While many like me do leave the classroom after the twoyear commitment we are still fighting to transform the system at a national level to serve all children equally
I personally hope to teach children again but for now I am committed to teaching adults about the stakes involved in letting our school system continue to operate as it does
