	To say that the story of Thomas Davis is a great tale of perseverance does not quite do it justice The man who is planning to play this weekendrsquos Super Bowl with a broken arm has fought adversity his entire sporting career and shown the focus and will to push past it Much like a blade of grass breaking the surface of the Earth Thomas Davis pushed through resistance he has faced He has come out the other side as a victor and is now just one win away from being a Super Bowl Champion
	
	Davis faced long odds from the beginning of his football career playing at RandolphClay High School in rural Georgia Though he was a very successful foursport athlete and played as many as eight different positions for his high school football team Thomas Davis had no offers to play Division 1 college football It was not until UGA defensive Coach Brian VanGorder saw Thomas Davis at a basketball practice that he got his one and only Division 1 offer He had the motivation and the drive to keepcompeting and kept at itnbspHe had a dream and the dedication and determination to get there
	
	He went on to resounding success at UGA as a linebacker and safety earning AllSEC honors and being drafted in the first round by the Carolina Panthers During his fifth year in the NFL however Thomas Davisrsquo medical issues began First it was discovered that he has an abnormality that causes him to have both two coronary arteries on the same side of his heart Luckily he was able to avoid having surgery due to his excellent health Unfortunately not long after learning this is when Thomas Davis suffered his first torn ACL The surgeon used some of his hamstring tendon to strengthen the ligament but it tore again during that same offseason Not to be deterred Davis went in for another surgery this time taking tendon from his left knee to try and prevent future injury In 2011 for the third time in three years Thomas Davis tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee
	nbsp
	He could have easily called it quits and retired There had never been an NFL player who had come back from 3 ACL tears in the same knee Instead Davis chose to revive and thrive to continue competing He vowed to come back strong from his injury and inspire hope among others And come back strong he did This year was his fourth straight season eclipsing the 100 tackle mark and he even earned his first Pro Bowl and AllPro honors He was also acknowledged for his community service work winning the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 2014
	
	Though he is having a wonderful year in typical Thomas Davis fashion this season is not without its obstacles Davis broke his arm in the Panthersrsquo NFC Championship victory and had surgery almost immediately Instead of creating more shortages voids and obstacles and making himself a victim he stood resolute and was able tonbsptap into his motivation to keepcompetingnbspMotivation is a key component to highlevel competition And as always Thomas Davis changes the way he looks at things and the things he looks at change So of course a broken arm isnrsquot going to stop him Davis is adamant he will play in the Super Bowl proving once again that the only person who manifests obstacles voids and shortages is the only person who can overcome or release them as wellnbspThat person is You
