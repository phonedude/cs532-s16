DLTKs Crafts for KidsSuper Bowl Sunday

The Super Bowl as I understand it is the American football championshipnbsp It is played once per year and the game decides who the
	winner of the NFL National Football League is for that year
More importantly Super Bowl Sunday has grown to be a great American tradition with friends and families gathering to cheer on their favorite team
For those of you who are curious here in Canada we have a similar game called the Grey Cupnbsp It decides the winner of the CFL
	Canadian Football League and occurs in late Novembernbsp
