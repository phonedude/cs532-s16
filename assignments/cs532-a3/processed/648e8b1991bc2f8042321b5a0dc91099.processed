  In April amid growing speculation that she would run for president Sen Elizabeth Warren  gave a pivotal speech titled The Unfinished Business of Financial Reform In it Warren laid out what the next Democratic president could and must do to complete the task of postcrisis financial reform
Specifically Warren said the next presidents agenda should

  
  
    
  



Defend DoddFrank against attempts to weaken or compromise it
Scale up enforcement investigations and convictions When big financial institutions are not deterred from breaking the law then thats what they will do
Tackle the shadowbanking sector which created runs and panics in the shortterm debt markets that spread the contagion across the financial system
Create a targeted financial transactions tax
Break up the biggest banks First cap the size of the biggest financial institutions then create a new GlassSteagall Act that rebuilds the wall between commercial banking and investment banking

Warren didnt wind up running for president But her five points are a good rubric for evaluating Hillary Clintons newly released plan to tame Wall Street Clintons agenda is a very detailed and comprehensive dive into financial reform It is broad covering parts of the financial markets that arent often discussed If anything it goes into such footnoted specifics that it can be overly wonky But it fits into the Warren framework well enough to compare and contrast the two approaches
Using the Warren criteria Clinton gets points on the first four but approaches the fifth by working through DoddFrank rather than against it Bernie Sanders gets major points on the last two but hasnt gotten specific on tackling shadow banking and the broader financial sector Rather than stronger or weaker were left with two different ways of prioritizing financial reform with Sanders focusing on eliminating the threat of the largest banks and Clinton looking to the financial markets as a whole
Test 1 Defend DoddFrank

Dodd Frank

  

Republicans are united in wanting to weaken or eliminate DoddFrank Major 2016 contenders such as Marco Rubio Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina have called for the outright elimination of the law without specifying any alternative So rallying against this is the first test
This is a pretty easy test for a Democratic candidate which Clinton like Sanders passes Clinton has sent three important signals to financial reformers First she wrote a letter pushing back on recent attempts to change the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau an important shortterm priority
Second her fact sheet emphasizes DoddFranks Section 956 which is the requirement to limit incentive pay for executives at large financial firms Section 956 is crucial to changing the nature of CEO pay at major banks so that it rewards longterm thinking and can be revoked if a firm fails To the chagrin of reformers it has stalled in rule writing Clinton would prioritize finalizing it

  
  
    
  


Third and most important in the fact sheet Clinton warns against efforts to roll back DoddFranks financial reforms in the upcoming budget and debt ceiling negotiations while vowing to veto any legislation that attempts to weaken the law and would fully enforce its protections One of reformers biggest worries at the moment is that this Decembers budget chaos could allow Republicans to push through major deregulations and that the president and Democrats would allow it Clinton is making a direct challenge to President Obama who may be called on to veto a budget if lobbyists are successful in their sneak attacks on reform
Test 2 Increased enforcement

Some bankers  like exGoldman Sachs bond seller Fabrice Tourre  faced civil charges after the financial crisis but they were the exception

  

Clinton wants to enforce financial regulations by leveling charges against individuals as well as corporations Following the criticism of regulators leveled by Warren and others the Clinton plan would have the Department of Justice curtail the deferral of prosecutions a tactic used often to the benefit of banks and other firms facing criminal charges Clinton would have the SEC forgo these agreements in cases of egregious or repeated lawbreaking and misconduct and require that firms admit wrongdoing Another important change would be the SEC curtailing large penalties and restriction on activities for repeat offenders a process all too common now This broken window style of policing is unpopular for community policing but is being emphasized in financial policing Restrictions on repeat offenders in particular are a core demand of Warrens
Clintons plan would also make funding for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission CFTC and SEC independent so that like other regulators they would not be subject to the booms and busts of congressional dysfunction This would give them the ability to better enforce the rules of the financial sector
Warrens agenda goes a bit further than this and takes the fight to the Federal Reserve arguing that the Fed should require votes on all major enforcement and supervisory decisions and that Fed governors should have independent staff This is a response to the lax supervision and enforcement the central bank displayed during the foreclosure crisis Clinton focuses on the other banking regulators and the Department of Justice but doesnt touch on the Federal Reserve in her plan
Though Bernie Sanders has been vocal about abuses in enforcement so far he hasnt laid out specifics
Test 3 Shadow banking

Gary Gensler a key influence on Hillary Clintons plan

  

Many reformers including the Roosevelt Institute with its Rewriting the Rules report have demanded a comprehensive policy agenda on shadow banking the network of lending and borrowing that takes place outside the formal banking sector Warrens speech calls for it to be a priority leaving the details to be determined later Thats a reasonable way to start the conversation since it is a difficult topic but eventually people need to start putting the specifics on the table
The Clinton fact sheet does exactly that with a detailed description on everything from stronger capital requirements for brokerdealers to requiring more disclosures for private equity
This section clearly reflects the influence of Gary Gensler the former CFTC commissioner and Goldman Sachs banker who fought with Obamas Treasury secretary Tim Geithner over making financial reform stronger The section discusses the international coordination of derivatives a topic that dominated the end of Genslers tenure at the CFTC According to reports his efforts to fight for the toughest regulations on this end also led to major conflicts with Obamas next Treasury secretary Jack Lew
Consistent with his approach of focusing on the biggest banks so far Bernie Sanders hasnt released a plan to deal with shadow banking
Test 4 Financial transaction tax

The NYSE trading floor

  

Hillary Clinton proposes a tax to combat highfrequency trading HFT by targeting orders that get canceled This is a worthwhile thing to combat but Clintons proposal would not raise much money since it only applies to HFT and would shrink the entire market substantially by design Its also not clear if it will make a dent on HFT unless it is broader or paired with efforts to regulate how often trades are made by say requiring them to batch up every 100 milliseconds
A transaction tax on the financial sector as a whole could raise as much as 50 billion a year according to the Tax Policy Center The Sanders campaign proposes such a financial transaction tax as a way of combating HFT as well as a way to pay for free college So this targeted versus expansive approach is a clear difference with Sanders taking a more aggressive approach
Test 5 Breaking up the banks

Paul Volcker whose namesake rule is at the crux of Hillary Clintons plan to limit big banks

  

Clinton unlike Warren or Sanders doesnt call for breaking up the banks by size and by business line through a new GlassSteagall Act Clinton also doesnt limit the Federal Reserves emergency lending further than it has been limited since DoddFrank as Warren wants to do But she does have a different approach
Clinton would instead build on the reforms in DoddFrank Instead of direct limitations her plan includes tax surcharges on the largest banks which are designed to slim them down President Obama proposed such a tax in 2010 but it was designed to raise revenues This would instead supplement capital requirements which have become the most practical way of pressuring the largest banks to downsize as GE Capital recently did It is not clear how aggressive this tax would be in practice but it is a different way of combating size
DoddFranks Volcker Rule  which separates hedge funds from commercial banking  has been described as the Obama administrations replacement of GlassSteagall And as Matt Yglesias described yesterday Clintons plan would bolster the rule by removing loopholes including the one introduced during last years budget fight Strengthening the Volcker Rule is a different approach to separating financial business lines one that sees hedge funds as more of a threat than the mingling of commercial and investment banking
Sanderss plans are more traditional He has breaking up the banks as the first two main items on his Wall Street agenda webpage He is a supporter of GlassSteagall and was also an early supporter of the SAFE Banking Act which would have broken up banks to be around 500 billion in size His newest bill the Too Big to Fail Too Big to Exist Act would ask regulators to break up banks they deem too risky explicitly including the biggest globally significant banks in the US like Citigroup JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs
Where should we aim

High We should aim up high

  

Stepping back there are two clear stories about whats wrong in the financial sector Bernie Sanderss agenda is based on the idea that DoddFrank did little to combat the threat of the largest financial institutions and we need to focus directly on them as both a political and an economic threat
Clintons approach looks to the financial markets as a whole Their focus on the largest banks is driven by turning up the regulations introduced in DoddFrank rather than going completely outside the framework The core of what they introduce that is new is meant to frame the problem of finance as broader than any group of large institutions
There are pros and cons to each approach Theres a real sense that slightly higher capital requirements could force the largest banks to reduce their size a process politically easier than breaking up the banks directly Depending on specifics the Clinton tax could do this Theres little reason to do only half a financial transaction tax as Clinton does especially if it isnt clear the moderate approach would be enough to put a dent in HFT The continued focus on GlassSteagall hangs oddly over the debate since the primary housing and financial crisis occurred outside the traditional commercial banking sector and future worries are as likely to be in opaque corners of the financial markets
