        Noah Caruso 17 calls South Philadelphia home Known for cheesesteaks pizza and bakeries South Philly is a closeknit largely Italian American neighborhood where much of the population has traditionally shared the same background culture and race Though an influx of immigrants has made the area more diverse in recent decades South Philly like the rest of the city remains highly segregated Carusos predominantly white community was echoed at his middle school Christopher Columbus Charter School where he says all of his teachers were white like him as were virtually all of his classmates It was against this backdrop that Caruso enrolled in Science Leadership Academy SLAa public magnet high school in the cityand landed in the freshman English class of Matthew Kay his first black teacherNow a rising senior Caruso looks back with appreciation on his ninthgrade year in Kays class Hes the most inspiring teacher I ever had by far Caruso said recalling Kays emphasis and commentary on fraught topics such as presentday racism He definitely pushed us to really think about these social issues that werent talked about before in my life because everyone grew up in the same area he continued We were all white  and everyone had the same opinion Caruso recalled a class in which Kay had students watch a scene from American History X a graphic 1998 film about neoNazis and white supremacy in America The teacher Caruso noted didnt hold back in expressing his perspective on the persistence of prejudice in the country It was one of many discussions with Kay that Caruso said opened his eyes to all of these things I never even thought about before  It inspired me to want to do something about it We were all white  and everyone had the same opinionThe importance of recruiting and retaining more teachers of color for students of color is wellreported and deeply researched Most teachersover 80 percentare white and surveys suggest that wont change anytime soon Among the ACTtested graduates in 2014 who said they planned on pursuing an education major 72 percent were white compared to 56 percent of all tested students Yet nonwhite children are now believed to make up a majority of the countrys publicschool population Studies show that academically nonwhite teachers produce more favorable outcomes for students of similar backgrounds emotionally and socially these educators serve as role models who share students racial and ethnic identity What hasnt gotten much attention however are the potential gains for white students The call for more teachers of color has grown more urgent in recent years because of Americas changing demographics In an increasingly multiracial multicultural society some education experts question the impact on white students world views when the face of teaching almost always mirrors their own Gloria LadsonBillings an African American professor of urban education at the University of WisconsinMadison broached this subject in a recent essay for Education Week responding to the apparent decline in nonwhite teacherswhat some observers have described as a disappearance crisis I want to suggest that there is something that may be even more important than black students having black teachers and that is white students having black teachers It is important for white students to encounter black people who are knowledgeable she wrote What opportunities do white students have to see and experience black competenceIn public schools where roughly 90 percent of the countrys children are enrolled the lessons students learn are often skewed because of who is delivering the instruction and what kind of curricula and learning materials that instruction entails Not only is the vast majority of the countrys teaching force white but Eurocentric attitudes also tend to filter into classrooms Some scholars including the Temple University African American studies professor Ama Mazama even attribute the notable rise in homeschooling among black families in part to the predominance of Eurocentric school curricula and teacher perspectives American childrens literature is also often limited to white characters and narrativesJust 23 percent of Chicagos publicschool teachers are black down from 40 percent in 2000Anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests that teachers of color can help disrupt what are often onesided portrayals of the world and offer invaluable insight to students from different backgrounds After all while Millennials see themselves asand are widely believed to bethe most tolerant generation in American history beneath the facade of a colorblind generation remains a deep underclass wrote the Demos researcher Sean McElwee in an Al Jazeera oped earlier this year Millennials are not as racially progressive as the narrative suggests One study in 2007 found that youth aged 10 through 19 had just as much implicit racial bias as older generations didand compared to some age groups even more of itIn Los Angeles Joel Laguna a Latino middleschool English and history teacher incorporates discussions of his own ethnicity into classroom lessons in an effort to deepen his students cultural understanding According to Laguna achieving that is possible in a classroom community where all his students many of whom are white feel validated Laguna previously taught at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles which he calls the quintessential Mexican American school virtually 100 percent of the student population is Hispanic and lowincome There he would talk in class about his childhood as an immigrant and his personal experiences he said would instantly resonate with his students Now at Thomas Starr King Middle School located in the Silver Lake area Laguna has a much more diverse crop of studentsracially ethnically and economicallywhich he says lends itself to much different fruitful classroom exchanges on social issues like immigrationRelated

Introducing these topics into class discussions is a tricky balance because I dont know how much these kids especially white kids are being exposed to these issues or discussing them at home Laguna said As a Latino teacher I am trying to be that role model and at the same time trying to open that door While many white students in the country are certainly aware of and sympathetic to the challenges faced by people of color many others Laguna suggested arent This past spring during the height of the Baltimore uprising Lagunas students led a twohour discussion that examined racial profiling A lot of the white kids were quiet he saidbut they were listening As the conversation progressed a white student asked why all of the models she sees on billboards are white too It was at that moment Laguna noted that I knew we were going there with these kids

As a teacher of color Laguna feels a responsibility to humanize subjects like immigration to ensure that all students not just those whove experienced it firsthand understand the issues complexities And when it comes to the white students in his class who he says have had less exposure to different cultural realities Laguna believes hes making inroads regarding their perception of people of color He recounts a lesson last year on undocumented immigrants most of whom work in lowwage jobs According to Laguna one of his white students responded Well if you want a better job you have to work harder Laguna didnt take offense to the comment the boy he suggested simply hadnt had an opportunity to challenge his own preconceived notions What Ive developed over time is asking Why do you think that Laguna continued Middle school is all about planting seeds he saidJuanita Douglas a veteran African American teacher at Lincoln Park High School in Chicago shared similar experiences Douglas said shes frequently the first black teacher many of her students have ever had about 28 percent of the schools students are white compared to 9 percent of students districtwide As an honors history and law teacher she sees her role as helping all of her students sharpen their writing and oralcommunication skills But achieving these goals can be tricky especially when it comes to her white students said Douglas citing the challenges she often faces in connecting with them and reconciling any differences in perspective Ill have white kids come up to me and say 2 Chainz has a new song and I have to stop them and say Im sorry Im 50 years old and I dont know who 2 Chainz is While Douglas recognizes their need to connect she stresses that Im not black and cool  their image of blackan image influenced by pop culture and rap music Im black and a teacherDouglas typically starts the school year discussing the concept of racial identity and harnessing what students have in commonwhat else defines themother than their race The idea is to get students to ask themselves Who am I as a human being Douglas said Once we get that settled then we can move into education She also seeks to engage her classes in activities in which students from other schools also participateacademic events where the vast majority of attendees arent white for examplein an effort to teach them both academic lessons and lessons about life Thats reality Sometimes you might be the only white person she said This world is increasingly becoming of color My students should be comfortable with their other schoolmatesAccording to Douglas whos the only black teacher in her department Lincoln Park employed 25 black teachers back when she started working there 15 years ago today only eight remain This is a trend seen across the Chicago Public Schools Just 23 percent of the districts teachers are black down from 40 percent in 2000 I dont think people are willing to say that teachers of color are important for all students Douglas said criticizing what she described as the Chicago districts failure to recruit a more diverse staff I think they think the black teacher is in place just so the black students have someone to talk to  A diverse teaching force can benefit society and all studentsAs a teacher of color he feels a responsibility to humanize subjects like immigrationThe societal advantages of more teachers of color become clearer when considering the racial socializationor the processes by which people develop their ethnic identitiesof white adults including the parents who may stumble in communicating racial understanding to their children A Public Religion Research Institute study on American Values circulated last summer following the shooting in Ferguson showed that 75 percent of white Americans have allwhite social networks This selfsegregation could help explain the racial divide over Michael Browns death and why it was seemingly so hard for many whites to understand what transpired in Ferguson Their worldview was restricted to mostly white friends and family And in a 2014 study researchers found that the messages that white teens received from parents regarding race were contradictory and incomplete concluding that schools are a crucial link in building productive and genuine relationships between whites and people of colorThis finding tracks with the experience of Matthew Kay Carusos English teacher in Philadelphia Kay who just completed his ninth year in the classroom is purposeful and precise in his teaching style Informally and without fuss he seeks to challenge misguided perceptions of black peoples work ethic and dismantle preconceived notions about black men According to Kay by interacting daily with people who come from different backgrounds white students who harbor stereotypes and prejudgments may be able to chip away at those convictions

If they come into the class feeling black people are dumb thats not going to survive contact with me or my black students for very long anyway he said I want white students to know that we work hardthat we have intellectual curiosity In his daytoday dealings with students Kay also fights the widespread centuriesold narrative that black men are driven by anger and frustration I am affectionate and caring  I think its important that the students see we have the capacity to love I think its important that my students see that black men have the capacity to loveUnderpinning it all Kay said are his close relationships with students and his ability to offer them a safe space to investigate and reflect on any racial privileges they enjoy without being made to feel morally deficient for having white skin These kinds of relationshipbuilding opportunities he said are lacking in too many schools and are seldom encouraged in undergraduate teaching programs In reality that should be 60 percent of what you learn he arguedKay practices this principle in the classroom and also as the founder and coordinator of the Philly Youth Poetry Movement Slam League which took the top prize this summer at an international youth poetry competition One of his white students and poets Veronica Nocella 17 describes her relationship with Kay as one that really transcends the classroom Nocella says she got into slam poetry because of him adding that she was going through a tough time when she got involved and that the experience has been lifechanging The slampoetry program Nocella said offered an environment where I felt the most human Nocella one of Kays students says that hes helped her discover slam poetry and express tough experiences shes had Lee MokobeOf course integrated and diverse student bodies are just as important as interracial studentteacher pairings when it comes to building a more racially literate generation Greta Haskell another student at SLA where the demographics closely reflect those of Philadelphia said learning alongside students of color helps actualize the new perspectives she gains from nonwhite teachers Last December Haskell participated in a diein at SLA to protest the nonindictment in the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases If I went off to college as a white student and didnt know how to interact with people not like me I wouldnt feel prepared Haskell saidThe racial composition makes the school a place where students listen to each other and absorb what the other students are saying and make sense of it said Larissa Pahomov an SLA teacher of color who serves on the schools diversity committee And according to the education professor Genevieve SiegelHawley white students are more likely to have a concrete understanding of racial and social injustices and less likely to be prejudiced when theyre immersed in racially diverse schools Still the push for diverse schoolswhich in part because of housing segregation are uncommon nationwidetypically highlights an array of benefits for students of color rather than that for their white counterparts Teacher diversity must be accompanied by systemic practices that support all educatorsIndeed combined with an integrated student population a diverse teaching staff can work to dispel myths about people of color and ultimately improve race relations Yet while teacher diversity is helpful at an individual level there are limitations to its potential systematically cautioned Thomas M Philip an education professor at UCLA whose work focuses on racial ideology and teachers Philip warned that putting the onus on teachers of color to carry the burden of discussions on larger historical and political issues carries significant risks ranging from exceptionalism and tokenism to individualizing an institutional responsibility Part of the pattern is that people who experience the brunt of racism are called upon to engage these conversations while those who privilege from it are let off the hook leading to a problematic dynamic in which black teachers are expected to talk about Ferguson while an honest conversation about whiteness and privilege isnt expected from a white teacher Philip saidTeacher diversity Philip stressed must be accompanied by systemic practices that support all educators in constructively navigating issues of race racism and racial justice To do otherwise he said is to allow some to abdicate their role in engaging the same issues deeply and profoundly The unique strengths and perspectives of teachers of color are more likely to be beneficial for students if all educators particularly white teachers and administrators embrace the responsibility to work for racial equity and justiceNevertheless the immediate and longterm payoff of pairing teachers of color with white students is evident Cedar Riener a cognitive psychologist and professor at RandolphMacon College in Virginia treasures his education in DC public schools for providing him with diverse teachers Compared to other states DC has one of the highest percentages of nonwhite teachers in the country In 2008 roughly twothirds of its teacher workforce was black My nerdy black chess coach and artistic black English teacher each undermined my own unconscious prejudice in their own ways he said ways I didnt realize at the time in middle school and high school

        The passing of Antonin Scalia roils the presidential campaign and could leave the Supreme Court deadlocked until 2017 Will the Senate even consider a replacement nominated by President Obama
        
        
            The sudden death of Antonin Scalia an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on Saturday morning will shake up American politics like few events in recent memory reshaping the 2016 presidential campaign and potentially leaving the Supreme Court deadlocked for more than a year13

In the short term President Obama will have to decide who to nominate to replace the voluble conservative jurist and the Republicanled Senate will have to decide whether to even consider the presidentx2019s pick in the heat of the election campaign Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately signaled that an Obama nominee would not get a vote this year x201CThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justicex201D the Kentucky Republican said in a statement x201CTherefore this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new presidentx201D CNN reported Saturday evening that Obama intends to nominate a new Supreme Court justice setting up a potential confrontation with Republicans that would play out both on xA0Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail13

        The number of American teens who excel at advanced math has surged Why 
        
        
            On a sultry evening last July a tall softspoken 17yearold named David Stoner and nearly 600 other math whizzes from all over the world sat huddled in small groups around wicker bistro tables talking in low voices and obsessively refreshing the browsers on their laptops The air in the cavernous lobby of the Lotus Hotel Pang Suan Kaew in Chiang Mai Thailand was humid recalls Stoner whose light South Carolina accent warms his carefully chosen words The tension in the room made it seem especially heavy like the atmosphere at a highstakes poker tournament13
13
Stoner and five teammates were representing the United States in the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad They figured theyx2019d done pretty well over the two days of competition God knows theyx2019d trained hard Stoner like his teammates had endured a grueling regime for more than a yearx2014practicing tricky problems over breakfast before school and taking on more problems late into the evening after he completed the homework for his collegelevel math classes Sometimes he sketched out proofs on the large dryerase board his dad had installed in his bedroom Most nights he put himself to sleep reading books like New Problems in Euclidean Geometry and An Introduction to Diophantine Equations13

        Does his faith influence his judicial decision making
        
        
            March was a hugely important month for religion and the Supreme Court and a pivotal moment for Justice Antonin Scalia the subject of a fat new biography Too bad we couldnx2019t talk plainly about what was and is at stake In a country historically averse to political debates about competing faiths nowhere is frank discussion of religion more taboo than at the US Supreme Court x201CReligion is the third rail of Supreme Court politics Itx2019s not something thatx2019s talked about in polite companyx201D as Jeff Shesol the author of a book about the New Deal Court put it He was speaking with NPRx2019s Nina Totenberg in 2010 when John Paul Stevens was looking at retirement and for the first time in American history there was the prospect of six Catholics three Jews and no Protestants on the highest court in the landx2014a watershed almost too x201Cradioactivex201D Totenberg remarked even to note And beware of venturing any further than that as the University of Chicago Law Schoolx2019s Geoffrey Stone did in a controversial 2007 blog post suggesting that the Supreme Courtx2019s five conservatives likely derived their abortion views from Catholic doctrine Scaliax2014a devout Catholic and the current Courtx2019s longestserving conservativex2014announced a boycott of the school until Stone leaves the faculty13

        Einsteinrsquos gravitational waves rest on a genuinely radical idea
        
        
            After decades of anticipation we have directly detected gravitational wavesx2014ripples in spacetime traveling at the speed of light through the universe Scientists at LIGO the Laser Interferometic Gravitationalwave Observatory have announced that they have measured waves coming from the inspiral of two massive black holes providing a spectacular confirmation of Albert Einsteinx2019s general theory of relativity whose hundredth anniversary was celebrated just last year13
13
Finding gravitational waves indicates that Einstein was once again right and opens a new window onto energetic events occurring around the universe But therex2019s a deeper lesson as well a reminder of the central importance of locality an idea that underlies much of modern physics13

Coming from Planet Android I wasnx2019t as put off by the larger dimensions as everyone else in the technosphere seemed to be But I was as usual put off by one thing that both the Apple product and its archnemesis from Google shared the unpocketability of the phone particularly by females13
13
This isnx2019t a new problem for women Our skinny jeans have pockets but there is no way an object bigger than a standard issue ID card fits in the front and everyone knows that slipping a phone in your back pocket is an invitation for a treacherous dive into a toilet or a backflip resulting in heartbreaking shatters Purses have enclosures that were once suitable for the flip phone generation but have since become too snug for newer models Throwing it into the main compartment seems risky at best13

            Meryl Streep at the Berlin film festival this week was asked whyx2014given OscarsSoWhite given that itx2019s 2016 given that come onx2014she had convened an allwhite panel to judge this yearx2019s festival entrants Invoking the rhetoric of an American president who had visited Berlin in the course of the last century Streep dismissed objections to her panelx2019s monochromism x201CThe thing that I notice is that there is a core of humanity that travels right through every culturex201D she said x201CAnd after all wex2019re all from Africa originally you know Wex2019re all Berliners wex2019re all Africans reallyx201D13

This wasnx2019t terribly surprising When Streep was asked last year in the course of promoting her extremely feminist film Suffragette whether she is herself a feminist the actor replied that no she isnx2019t Instead x201CI am a humanistx201D she said x201CI am for nice easy balancex201D 13

            As it stands the international coalition is far from winning the information war against the Islamic State Its air strikes may be squeezing the group in Iraq and Syria and killing many of its leaders but that has not halted the selfproclaimed caliphatex2019s ideological momentum Indeed at the end of 2015 it was estimated that the number of foreigners travelling to join militant groups in Iraq and Syriax2014predominantly the Islamic Statex2014had more than doubled in the course of just 18 months Whatx2019s more while these figures may be striking sheer numbers are less important than intent when it comes to the organizationx2019s actual threat to the world As we have already seen it takes a very small number of people to unleash great terror whether in Iraq Syria or elsewhere13

        Ben Stillerrsquos followup to his own comedy classic is a downright bummer no matter how many celebrity cameos it tries to cram in
        
        
            You donx2019t need to go to the theater to get the full experience of Zoolander 2 Simply get your hands on a copy of the original watch it and then yell a bunch of unfunny topical lines every time somebody tells a joke Thatx2019s how it feels to watch Ben Stillerx2019s sequel to his 2001 spoof of the fashion industry Zoolander 2 takes pains to reference every successful gag you remember from the original and then embellish them in painfulx2014often offensive almost always outdatedx2014fashion Itx2019s a film that has no real reason to exist and it spends its entire running time reaffirming that fact13

13
The original Zoolander to be fair had no business being as funny as it wasx2014it made fun of an industry that already seems to exist in a constant state of selfparody and much of its humor relied on simple malapropisms and sight gags But it was hilarious anyway as a candid snapshot of the fizzlingout of x201990s culture Like almost any zeitgeist comedy it belonged to a particular momentx2014and boy should it have stayed there With Zoolander 2 Stiller who directed cowrote and stars tries to recapture the magic of 2001 by referencing its past glories with increasing desperation perhaps to avoid the fact that he has nothing new to say about the fashion industry or celebrity culture 15 years laters13

Many people in this world would find my behavior rather strange Thatx2019s because Americans are exceptionally promiscuous when it comes to professing their love In the United States x201CI love youx201D is at once exalted and devalued It can mean everything  or nothing at all This is not universally the case13
