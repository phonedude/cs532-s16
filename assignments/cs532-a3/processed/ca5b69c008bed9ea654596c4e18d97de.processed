 This 50th Super Bowl on paper looks like a good one with the No 1 seeds from both conferences taking to the field at Levis Stadium this Sunday at 630 PM ET It only took minutes for many of the sportsbooks to put up a line on Super Bowl 50 it opened with Carolina as a small 3point favorite The money flooded in on the NFC champs over the next few hours driving line up to 45 by nights end and by midweek the point spread on the game hit 6 The total line hasnt had much of a ride opening at most shops in the 45 to 455 range and has since fallen to 44 or 445 depending on the bookmaker
The Panthers come into this game off of 4915 beat down of the Cardinals in the NFC title game for their 17th win of the season to go with just one defeat by NFC South foe the Atlanta Falcons The public loves this NFC Champion with them not only racking up the Ws but also tallying 13 spread covers in their 18 games this season Carolina hasnt just squeaked out the wins the margin of victory has been by 7 points or greater in 66 of their matches this season So their ability to extend margins isnt in question but the strength of their schedule does
Carolinas regular season opponents finished with a combined winloss record of 107149 in the regular season which translates to a 4179win percentage If we back out the games against the Panthers the number improves to 106134 but still a subpar 4415 Carolina played just four regular season games against teams with a winning record and those teams certainly werent elite playing the 106 Seahawks 97 Texans and the 97 Redskins

The Broncos were in control for most of the AFC Championship game against the Patriots and in the end they hung on to clinch a 2018 victory which was decided by a missed twopoint conversion The defense pounded the Pats QB Tom Brady with knockdowns on a high number of his drop backs  Denver QB Peyton Manning saw his numbers regress from his previous game against the Steelers but he looked more comfortable as his offensive line plus the play calling did a bang up job limiting the pressure Keep in mind that both his playoff starts were against two of the top three sack units in the league with only Denver itself having more
The Broncos went 115 on the season but they didnt impress against the spread with a juice losing 772 regular season versus the posted line  While they did have fewer victories than Carolina they faced a vastly superior group of opponents in comparison  Denvers competitors totaled a combined 150106 for a strong 5859 WL percentage and with the exclusion of games against the Broncos they would have a 14694 WL record good for an impressive 6083 winning percentage

Run Defense
Both of these clubs rank in the top 4 for rushing yards allowed per game with Denver allowing just 836 while Carolina allows 884 RYPG The Broncos 33 yards leads the league in fewest yards per carry and the Panthers are also solid in this category with 39 YPC
Carolina had half time leads of 14 points or more in six of their last nine regular season games which had their opponents getting away from the running attack which would skewed the numbers On the season the Panthers opponents matched or exceeded 25 rushing attempts on six occasions eclipsing the 100yard mark in five of those games The Broncos said at the beginning of the season that the running game was going to be a key component of their offense and they accomplished that in the last nine games handing the ball off 25 or more times in seven of the games and falling one yard short of hitting the century mark 99 yards vs NE in eight of the nine contests
I see Carolina getting their yardage in the run game as well Denvers YPC is outstanding but they did allow seven teams to run for 100 yards although only Kansas City in the first match 144 yards on 50 YPC and Minnesota 113 yards on 54 YPC to run for over yards and surpass 40 YPC Carolina is a step below those two clubs managing just 43 YPC versus the Chiefs and Vikings 47 They did however grind out 2282 rushing yards to finish second in the league in that category

Pass Defense
The Broncos lead the league in fewest passing yards allowed per game at just 200 while the Panthers were a more than respectable 11th allowing 235 yards through the air which was just 10 yards fewer than the 4th ranked team What I believe is a better indication of a quality pass defense is the yards per attempt statistic and they both excelled in that category allowing a league best 62 yards per with only decimal points separating the two squads
Over the regular season both teams faced their share of top flight pass offenses but the Broncos did a superior job against teams in that category  The Steelers lit them up for 354 passing yards back in Week 15 but Denver was playing without both starting safeties and arguably their top back up in that contest Every other opponent on the regular season schedule was held to 262 yards or fewer
Carolina allowed only three teams to surpass 300 yards passing in the regular season but what is concerning is that only Arizona with Carson Palmer and his injured finger were the only team that didnt pass for at least 296 yards in their last four including playoffs games The good thing for the Panthers is that Mannings arm strength isnt the same as it used to be which lowers the probability of getting lit up by the deep ball

Summary
I was very tempted to take the underdog Broncos here but I believe there is more value in the total Carolina loves to run the ball leading the league in attempts per game with a fraction under 33 and I dont expect them to have a high percentage of passing plays Only the Steelers and the Patriots late in the AFC title game had any kind of success against the Broncos pass defense and the Panthers certainly dont have the talent at the receiver position to compare to those clubs Unlike Arizona Denver doesnt need to dial up blitz packages to get pressure on the QB something that Newton has been killing this season
The Broncos as mentioned have been giving their running backs a lot of action over their last nine games averaging 2988 carries per match and will need to stay with it to slow down their opponents pass rush Manning has been very careful with the ball throwing a lot of high percentage short passes and there is no reason to think that hell continue that in this game

Free Carolina Panthers vs Denver Broncos Prediction
The Broncos just dont give up a lot of points with only New England and Pittsburgh scoring over 20 points against them in their last nine games The Panthers have allowed over 20 points three times in their last 10 games but all three of the opponents had superior passing attacks compared to Denvers unit Both teams have proven that they need to stick with a game shortening running attack to have any shot at winning
