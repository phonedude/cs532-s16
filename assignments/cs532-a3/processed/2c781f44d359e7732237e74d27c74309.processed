On Sunday evening millions of people willgather around their TV sets to watch Super Bowl 50 The game features the Denver Broncos taking on the Carolina Panthers andkickoff is scheduled for630 ET
For those of you who aren8217t going to be around a television Sundaynight but still want tofollow along with the action we8217ve put together a list of ways you8217ll be able to do so using an iPhone iPad Mac and otherdevices
Your options this year are fairly straightforward CBS is hosting the Super Bowl and it will be streaming the game for free via its website and mobile appsno cable subscription required Unfortunately Verizon still holds exclusive rights for streaming NFL games on smartphones but you8217ll be able to accessthe free broadcast almost anywhere else
How to watchthe Super Bowl on iPhone

As in years past live streaming for the Super Bowl on the iPhone and other smartphones is limited to Verizon customers here in the United States So if you want to watch the game on your handsetin any kind of official capacity youll have to go through them Fortunately for those of you who are VZW subscribers this is supereasy to do and free for most folks You8217ll just need to grab the NFL Mobile app from the App Store
Of course there areotherways to watch the big game on your iPhoneand byother waysI mean hackyworkaroundsFor instance you could open the CBS website on a desktop computer and then remotely connect to it from your smartphone using a VNC app ThoughI can8217t imagine quality would be very good Or you could use aSlingbox or other DVR with similar functionality to stream the game to your phone but this can get very pricey if you don8217t already own one Finally if all else fails I don8217t imagine it8217s going to be too difficult to find a nonofficial stream of the game online somewhere
How to stream the Super Bowl on iPad

Gettingthe Super Bowl on your iPad is a much simpler task Just download theCBS Sports app from the App Storeagain you won8217t need any kind of login credentials In addition to live game coverage the app will alsooffer stats breaking news highlights and other contentI8217m sure there will beother options but I can8217t imagine you8217ll find a better way to watch the game on your tablet than this
How to watchthe Super Bowl on Apple TV

Luckily CBS also has a CBS Sports app on Apple TV so you8217ll be able to watch the game through it Folks who have the new fourth generation Apple TVwill have to manually search for it and download it but like its mobile counterpart it8217s free and doesn8217t require a cable subscription
How to stream the Super Bowl on PC or Mac

Watching the Super Bowl on your Mac or PC is also extremely easy Just navigate yourself to the CBSSportscom website As with the iPad app expect to find uptotheminute stats news and game highlights in addition to the live stream
Other ways to follow the Super Bowl action

If you don8217t really care about watching the Super Bowl live but want to make sure you follow enough to participate in the water cooler conversations at work the following day I have a few recommendations for you The first is YouTube Google8217s popular video sharing service has a special section for Super Bowl commercials so you cansee each of the high budget commercial spots before they go viral
The secondisthe official ESPN app This will allow you to check the score of the big game at your leisure and quickly access important information like who has gotten hurt which player made the big play and more Yes there are a number of sportsnews apps in the App Store but I like ESPN because it8217s welldesigned and very accurate
Finally I recommend Twitter For all of its problems I think Twitter makes for a great way to follow live events like the Super Bowl You8217ll see realtime reactions from fans exathletes and other experts and often times reporters will break newsthink injury reports and other onfield issueswell before you see them on air I know it8217s tough to find these kinds of tweets unless you8217re already following the right people but if you just search the site for terms like SuperBowl50 Broncos Panthers or variations of these words you8217ll likely stumble across some great content
Again the Super Bowl kicks off at 630 ET on Sunday night at Levi8217s Stadium in Santa Clara California If you think we missed something significantparticularly for international users I8217m not very familiar with nonUS NFL licenseslet us know in the comments below
