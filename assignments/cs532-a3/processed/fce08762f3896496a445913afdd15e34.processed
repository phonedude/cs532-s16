    A new report shows misconduct and false confessions helped land innocent people in prisonmdashBy Stephanie Mencimer  Wed Feb 3 2016 856 AM ESTTweetEmail Sean LeanShutterstockCall it the Serial effect According to a new report from the University of Michigan Law Schools National Registry of Exonerations 2015 set a record for the number of wrongly convicted Americans who finally found justice There were 149 people last year who were either declared innocent or otherwise cleared of the consequences of their convictions or guilty pleas Many had served some lengthy prison timemdashthe average exoneree had served nearly 15 yearsmdashfor crimes they did not commit

The data in the report paints a disturbing portrait of a criminal justice system riven with errors and official misconduct Among the lowlights

	Innocent but pleaded guilty An extraordinary number of the exonerations came in cases in which the defendants had pleaded guilty 65 out of 149 more than in any previous year since the registry started in 1989 These were mostly drug cases but also included eight homicides Those who pleaded guilty to crimes they didnt commit tended to be mentally ill intellectually disabled or under the threat of an even longer prison sentence should they try to go to trial
	Nocrime crimes Seventyfive exonerations came in cases where it turned out no crime had even been committed A number of these were old murder cases involving arson They brought to mind the sad story of Cameron Todd Willingham whom Texas executed in 2004 for allegedly murdering his three children through arson despite significant evidence that the forensic arson investigation that led to his conviction was mostly bogus Those same sorts of bogus fire investigations played a role in five of six of the homicide cases that led to exonerations last year in cases where officials ruled that no crime had been committed In those cases the defendants were luckier than Willingham The fires that led to their murder convictions were shown to be accidents not arson and their convictions were vacated
	False confessions In 27 of the exonerations in 2015 including 22 homicide cases the defendants confessed to crimes they hadnt committed Many of these people were juveniles mentally ill or intellectually disabledmdashprecisely the folks currently overrepresented on death row
	Official misconduct Prosecutors and cops dont come out looking good in the new report Official misconduct was a factor in 75 percent of the homicide exonerations a number thats even bigger in the cases where there were false confessions Eightytwo percent of those were the product of misconduct by cops or prosecutors
	Death penalty errors Five of the exonerees in 2015 were death row inmates three of whom had been there more than 20 yearsmdashmore evidence of serious flaws in the capital punishment system



	National Registry of Exonerations


The exonerations were clustered in jurisdictions where local prosecutors had made significant efforts to reform their practices to prevent wrongful convictions The largest number came from Harris County Texas where a new assistant district attorney in the postconviction review section discovered that a lot of the cases coming through her office involved defendants whod pleaded guilty to a drug crime only to have lab work come back months later showing that the stuff cops had seized from the defendants wasnt actually a controlled substance

Washington Post columnist Radley Balko has dug into this issue and found that Harris County isnt the only place with the problem The field tests cops use to test for drugs are notoriously unreliable and theyve mistaken everything from chocolate chip cookies to cheese and tortilla dough for drugs Nonetheless the false guilty pleasmdashusually made under pressure and the threat of even longer prison sentences from a jury trialmdashoften arent thrown out when later testing finds an absence of drugs In 2014 the Harris County district attorneys office launched a Conviction Integrity Unit to try addressing such problems The result is a startling number of drug crime exonerations just from that one officemdash73 of them so far

Such units within prosecutors offices offer hope for reforms to the criminal justice system But the new report suggests they have a mixed record that can depend largely on the drive of an individual prosecutor rather than systemic support Harris County has shown lots of promise as has a unit in Brooklyn which has been responsible for the exoneration of 16 murder defendants in the past two years A more discouraging example came in New Orleans which launched a Conviction Integrity Unit during the district attorneys reelection campaign in partnership with the local Innocence Project According to the report the unit kicked off in January 2015 worked on a single exoneration and gave it up a year later

Media accounts and shows like Serial and Making a Murderer have raised awareness about the problems with the criminal justice system and the prevalence of wrongful convictions but the report urges caution before declaring victory quotAs with climate change the significance of the issue of false convictions is now widely acknowledged despite committed doubtersquot the authors write quotIn other respects we are far behind We have no measure of the magnitude of the problem no general plan for how to address it and certainly no general commitment to do so Weve made a start but thats allquot
