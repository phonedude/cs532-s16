    Whats happening in Flint Michigan is unconscionable
A city of 99000 people  56 percent AfricanAmerican 40 percent living below the poverty line  has spent nearly two years with poisoned water
Nearly two years of boil orders foul smells and false reassurances that the water was safe to drink
Nearly two years of having residents concerns dismissed and belittled by the state government
RELATED An American Disaster The Crisis in Flint
Now thousands of kids may have been exposed to harmful levels of lead which can irreparably harm brain development and cause learning and behavioral problems The rate of lead poisoning among children has nearly doubled since Flint approved a stateappointed emergency managers plan to switch their water source And even now that the state is finally launching a belated response Flints undocumented immigrant community is reportedly afraid to get the help they need
Flint isnt alone There are a lot more Flints out there  overwhelmingly lowincome communities of color where pollution toxic chemicals and staggering neglect adds to families burdens
We need to face some hard truths about race and justice in America After 250 years of slavery 90 years of Jim Crow and decades of separate but equal our countrys struggle with racism is far from over Thats true in our criminal justice system In our education system In employment housing and transit And tragically its true in the very air our children breathe and in the water they drink

    Life in Flint A logistical financial and health nightmare  
  
    As officials search for shortterm fixes and longterm answers Flint residents are living like refugees  with no timetable for returning to normal  

Whats happening in Flint today happened 10 years ago in predominantly lowincome AfricanAmerican and Latino areas of Washington DC Lead leached into the water there for four years In highrisk neighborhoods the number of toddlers and infants with lead poisoning more than doubled
In Baltimore families have received settlements for the lifelong health effects of childhood lead poisoning And now private companies are going around getting people many of whom are permanently disabled to sign away hundreds of thousands of dollars in future payments in exchange for a few thousand dollars right away Its an outright abuse of vulnerable people who have been hurt too many times already
Near San Francisco where housing prices have skyrocketed many lowincome families live in moreaffordable Richmond California Richmond is 26 percent AfricanAmerican and 40 percent Latino and the housing prices are low for a reasonbecause the city is surrounded by oil refineries chemical companies and eight Superfund sites Its no surprise that the city has the highest hospitalization rate for asthma in all of Contra Costa County
Twenty seven schools are within 1 mile of a highrisk chemical facility in the Manchester neighborhood of Houston  a neighborhood that is 85 percent Latino In Manchester rates of childhood leukemia asthma and bronchitis are all above averageThe children who go to public schools there are 56 percent more likely to get leukemia than kids who live 10 miles away
RELATED The Flint Water Crisis A Timeline
And lowincome white communities are by no means immune In 2008 525 million gallons of toxic coal ash which contains lead and thallium among other toxins spilled in Tennessee covering 3000 acres of land destroying 12 homes and flowing into the Tennessee River which provides drinking water The long legacy of coal mining has left Appalachia and other coal regions pockmarked with toxic sites in need of cleanup
Environmental justice cant just be a slogan  it has to be a central goalCities are full of lead paint in lowincome housing lead embedded in the very soil from the days of leaded gasoline Already AfricanAmerican children are twice as likely to suffer from asthma as white children  and climate change will put vulnerable populations at even greater risk
Im not new to this fight As first lady I worked with the EPA to bring attention to the link between air pollution and child asthmaIn the Senate I made this a central issue fighting for more support for lead paint and soil remediation in New York and across the country pushing the EPA to establish indoor air quality standards for schools and working across the aisle to call for a national program tracking the health effects of pollution At the State Department I took the fight for environmental justice worldwide with the Clean Cookstoves Initiative
    Environmental justice cant just be a slogan  it has to be a central goal
    

And as president I will make environmental justice a central part of my comprehensive commitment to lowincome communities of color  by pursuing cleaner transportation ambitious steps to reduce air pollution dedicated efforts to clean up toxic sites more resources for lead remediation and greener more resilient infrastructure Because clean air and clean water are basic human rights  and our rights shouldnt change between ZIP codes
Communities and kids across our country have been bearing the burden of environmental racism for too long Its harming their health their educations every aspect of their lives and futures We can no longer accept the status quo  and as president I never will
Editor8217s note This is an oped and should not be taken as an endorsement of Hillary Clinton8217s candidacy or views MSNBC has reached out to Bernie Sanders8217s campaign to see if he too wishes to contribute an oped
