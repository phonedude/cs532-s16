  Boxing  At MY Age  
        nbsp

I like to mix up my cardio and muscle strengthening practices to keep my muscles guessing and my metabolism burning and confused 8220Incorporating musclestrengthening exercises two to three times per week and some extra intensity cardio and strength a day or two a week will stimulate strength gains fitnessand calorie burn8221 says Jennifer Sacheck PhD associate professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University She explains how strengthbased exercises slow the effects of aging by defying the 35 loss of muscle that happens every year after age 30 if no strengthbased fitness is practiced Muscle building also promotes bone density which can be an issue as you age

So what new workout class did I choose Boxing of course Well kind of boxing It8217s a circuit workout called 9Round 30 min Kickboxing Fitness You can go whenever it works for your schedule versus most classes which happen at predetermined times The workouts start every 3 minutes After starting you switch stations every 3 minutes and the trainerexplains that days exercise It differs every day

I burn between 200300 calories most times during the 30 minute rotation I get to punch heavy weight bags with my hands that are wrapped and protected by boxing gloves I kick the bag with my feet working all zones including arms shoulders abs core gluten legs and calves It8217s a huge stress reliever and also comes with access to the Internet 9Round community and dieting tips

I also love that you may see men or women from age 16 to 80 Every one is working hard and leave sweating and feeling powerful There is no boxing contact with your face just good old hard work See if it8217s in your community Your first workout is free 9roundcom
