				A spokesman for Sen Ted Cruzs presidential campaign announced Thursday it has raised 3 million since he won the Iowa caucuses Monday night

Campaign manager Jeff Roe tweeted out the news also sharing that the Texan has received 10 million through 182000 contributions since January 1 Cruz currently has just under 19 million cash on hand



10M from 182000 contributions averaging 55 has been raised since January 1 thru last night 3M since 10 pm on February 1 Thank you Jeff Roe jeffroe February 4 2016






Cruzs beating out GOP frontrunner Donald Trump has given him the attention of super PACs and individual donors However the win and increase in donations do not guarantee another victory
