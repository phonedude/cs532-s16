Here are the most talkedabout exchanges between Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at MSNBCs debate in Durham NH on Feb 4 Jenny StarrsThe Washington Post   Usually on debate night we track what people are searching for on Google as a way of assessing what people are curious about as the candidates tussle In that regard Bernie Sanders eked out a narrow victory getting more search attention both nationally and in New Hampshire where it counts ahead of Tuesdays primary     The biggest spike came once the debate was over Weve seen in the past that personal comments can drive search interest so its possible that part of this interest was spurred by curiosity about Sanderss immigrant father mentioned in the candidates closing statement Whats particularly interesting though is what New Hampshirites want to know more about for each of the candidates Google has a page dedicated to the debate on which they list the five trending questions for both Sanders and Hillary Clinton in the state These are the top five questions for each Clinton 1 How old is Hillary Clinton 2 Who can beat Hillary 3 Where is Hillary Clinton today 4 Will Hillary win 5 How much is Hillary Clinton worth Clinton is 68 years old shes worth a lot of money and today she was in New Hampshire The other two questions are about if she can win and if not to whom she could lose Consider those questions in light of the questions people had about Bernie Sanders Sanders 1 Where will Bernie Sanders be speaking 2 Why Bernie Sanders 3 Who would be Bernie Sanders VP 4 How to donate to Bernie Sanders 5 Where can I see Bernie Sanders in NH The first and fifth questions like the question about where Clinton is are for people to go hear from the candidate Why Bernie Sanders is a question about why his candidacy should be considered But none of that matters once you get to No4 The fourthmostGoogled question about Bernie Sanders is how can I give him money Sanders has more than3 million individual contributions from more than a million donors Hes taken in money at a faster pace than Barack Obama did in 2008 and in January outraised Clinton Getting a voter to try and figure out how to give is a dream come true for any campaign Having it trend on Google Insane This is New Hampshire the state where no matter how the next few months unfold Sanders will do better than almost any other There are a lot of ways to explore the differences in the questions asked about Sanders and Clinton in New Hampshire and getting more people interested in searching for more information in general is a win But theres no greater victory for a campaign than getting a voter to take action In that regard Sanders won by a mile         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close
