	While Im not much of a sports fan I am a fan of any organized activity which involves a uniform involving branded colors logos and design  oh and extremely blingy jewelry for the victors
I was fortunate enough to be invited on a semiprivate tour of the NFL headquarters in NYC last summer and learned more about football than I thought possible I learned which teams are owned by women Chicago Bears owned by Virginia Halas McCaskey and the Detroit Lions owned by Martha Firestone and that the Super Bowl ring design is decided by the ownership and management of said team who also decide just how many diamonds will be in each ring and whether a lower cost version will be made available for office staff and even a super affordable version for fans
And while I did see all 49 designs I didnt get to try any on
Since Super Bowl 50 is rapidly approaching we thought it would be a good idea to give fans some ideas of how to dress for the big game whether or not their teams are playing
STICK TO THE BASICS
A really safe bet when dressing for a Super Bowl party is to stick to team colors So say that youre a Denver Broncos fan leaves time for fans to cheer you can wear a pair of indigo colored jeans with a bright orange top In this way youre giving a nod to the team of the moment without going the full face painting route
FEMININE FOOTBALLERS
Who says that you have to look gruff to support your favorite team Touch by Alyssa Milano yes that Alyssa Milano offers a fashionable alternative for women football fans theres a full line of official NFLPAlicensed fashion tops and hoodies that feature many of their favorite players names and numbers and prices range from 3080 This cute tee can also be worn under a jacket to the office or paired with your full team regalia

ADD ONE BRANDED ITEM
In case you missed it it really is more accepted to wear your favorite team jersey and colors not just during football season but year round Is your obsessive fandom of the subtler variety Team socks are more of a wink to your team spirit than a fully committed outfit

UNEXPECTED BLING
Maybe you dont happen to have a Super Bowl ring just lying around your apartment but you can have some fun with the idea of football inspired jewelry This cute belly button ring gives a nod to the football madness without a serious commitment or go for a charm bracelet that hints at your favorite team instead of pummeling someone with your favorite
 
A CUTE HANDMADE ACCESSORY
From frilly team color scarves to warm woolen headbands you can mix and match accessories in team colors to create the effect of team inspired wear without the expensive price tag
 
GO UGLY
Remember that ugly NFL sweater you wore last Christmas Im almost certain that you can get at least one more wearing out of it without being mocked mercilessly by your friends
 
HOLD YOUR HANDS HIGH
Apparently Jimmy Fallon endorsed this recent launch by Dicks Sporting Goods Hands High apparel which feature logos in the armpits of sweaters and apparels to show off your team spirit while doing the wave Super cute and with only one other small logo wearable during the year as well
