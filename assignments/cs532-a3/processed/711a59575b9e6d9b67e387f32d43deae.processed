A few Iowa precincts that ended their caucuses with the flip of a coin have led to an avalanche of terrible coverage much of it outright false Raise your hand if youve seen coverageclaiming that Hillary Clintons narrowIowa Caucus win was determined entirely by coin tosses which her camp somehow won every single time they happened If you have youve seen some of this bad reporting

Maybe you sawChuck Toddclaiming that Basically were talking a coin flip may have decided the presidency Maybe you saw an outlet like Fox News makingsimilar claims but then thats Fox News Maybe you saw a Bernie Sanderssupporting outlet angry that the caucus results could supposedly have gone the other waywith a different call of the coin In most of these cases reporters were confusing countylevel delegates for state delegate equivalents but county delegates and state delegates are two very different things with the county level being worth much much less when it comes to finally awarding Iowas national delegates the ones that decide who will be the Democratic presidential nomineeThe Des Moines Register explains


The delegates that were decided by coin flips were delegates to the partys county conventions of which there are thousands selected across the state from 1681 separate precincts They were not the statewide delegate equivalents that are reported in the final results

The statewide delegate equivalents that determine the outcome on caucus night are derived from the countylevel delegates but are aggregatedacross the state and weighted in a manner that makes individual county delegate selections at a handful of precincts count for a tiny fraction of the ultimate result


You may also have seen the widely repeated claim that there weresix coin flipsMonday night and Clinton won them alla claim almost always included in pieces that confused county delegates and state delegate equivalents but also in pieces attempting to explain the delegate differencesBut heres the realityNo one knows how many precincts were decided by a coin toss


Iowa Democratic Party spokesman SamLau said seven coin flips were reported statewide and Bernie Sanders won six of them

The Des Moines Register has identified six coin flips through social media and one in an interview with a caucus participant Of those seven Clinton was the apparent winner of six Its unknownif there is any overlap between the coin flips identified by the Register andthe coin flips the state partyconfirmed


Monday yielded an incredibly close outcome and its alluring to think it came down to chance in the most literal sense But that allure doesnt excuse the terrible reporting and outright misrepresentation thats been so widely repeated
