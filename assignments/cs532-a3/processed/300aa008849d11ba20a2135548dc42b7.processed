    Hillary Clinton needed to land a punch She didnt

Sen Bernie Sanders headed into the final Democratic debate before Tuesdayrsquos New Hampshire primary with somewhere between a 16 and 30 percentage point lead against Hillary Clinton depending on which cheaply conducted poll with an unprofessionally large margin of error you choose to trust Wersquore going to wager that what Sanders has in spite of the shakiness of the polls is a significant lead and one that doesnrsquot appear to be wavering following Clintonrsquos narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses

That meant that if Clinton wants to either win the New Hampshire primary or place above a wellspun bar of expectations singledigit loss she needed to land a number of serious blows against Sanders Thursday night She did not

On the issue of whether she is a ldquoprogressiverdquomdashsomething Sanders and his campaign have quite aggressively questioned in word and tweetsmdashClinton reiterated the retort she debuted in Wednesday nightrsquos CNN town hall Since when did you become the ldquogatekeeperrdquo of progressivism ldquoUnder his definitionrdquo she said ldquoPresident Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street Vice President Biden is not progressive because he supported Keystone Even the late great Sen Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for the Defense of Marriage Actrdquo





 



  One of the reasons Sanders did so well was the favorability of the debate subjects during prime viewing time
  
  





As she is wont to do Clinton was trying to bang Sanders over the head with President Obamarsquos popularity among Democrats Sanders was able to respond in a measured way that reinforced his belief that he does not in fact hate President Obama ldquoWe are in much better shape today than we were seven years ago although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago Thatrsquos the fact Do I think President Obama is a progressive I do I disagree with him on a number of issues But I think hersquos done an excellent jobrdquo






One of the reasons Sanders did so well was the favorability of the debate subjects during prime viewing time Several segments in the first hour were devoted to Wall Street Clintonrsquos closeness to the financial sector and her paid speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs which she delivered as she said when she hit the ldquospeaking circuitrdquo following her tour at the State Department






Clinton rather than coyly trying to deflect the importance of those speeches tried to hit Sanders the hardest she has in any debate so far ldquoIrsquove tried to keep my disagreements over issues as it should berdquo she said But now itrsquos time to get nasty






Time and time again by insinuation there is this attack that he is putting forth which really comes down to you know anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought I just absolutely reject that senator I really donrsquot think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you Enough is enough If yoursquove got something to say say it directly You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities and Irsquom very proud of that I think itrsquos time to end the artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks and letrsquos talk about the issues that divide us














  
  
  
  





Sanders was visibly taken aback by the ldquoartful smearrdquo language But if she thought this was going to deter him from making the attack any longer This is Famously OnMessage Bernie Sanders and all she did was present him an opportunity to talk about the corrosive effects of lax campaignfinance regulations that allow corporations to buy the government






ldquoLets talk about why in the 1990s Wall Street got deregulatedrdquo he said ldquoDid it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions Well some people might think that had some influencerdquo He continued on with similar examples about the governmentrsquos similar acquiescence of pharmaceutical companies and the fossilfuel industry ldquoThere is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system In my view itrsquos undermining American democracy and allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this countryrdquo






In one of Clintonrsquos worst moments of the debatemdashbecause now if it already wasnrsquot itrsquos going to hang a cloud over her headmdashwas her response to a question from moderator Chuck Todd about whether she would release the transcripts from all of her paid speeches She has previously laughed off such questions when approached with them on the rope line Perhaps she should have prepared a better answer when she was asked about it on live television because her answer was ldquoIrsquoll look into it I donrsquot know the statusrdquo






This does not mean that Sanders had a perfect night The sum total of his foreign policy platform remains Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq war in 2002 In one especially dicey moment he was asked directly about what his policy in Afghanistan was and he responded with a line about how he would not send ground troops to Iraq or Syria On Wall Street he still does not have an answer for his vote for the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act which deregulated derivativesmdashhe speaks about his support for GlassSteagall instead which is a much different issue Itrsquos also a questionable attack from Clinton considering her husbandmdashwhose economic and jobs growth record she proudly touts in her stump speech as a credential for her campaignmdashsigned the package that included the CFMA and in general shepherded through plenty of financial deregulatory measures But if he canrsquot answer it she might as well keep saying it

But there was nothing Clinton introduced Thursday night to seriously wound Sanders and he was able to parry her more occasionally aggressive posture Sanders needs to maintain his strong New Hampshire lead and hope to use the 11 days following the primary when he would be the reigning winner to sway more voters in more diverse states to his side Itrsquos a tough strategy But if it doesnrsquot work out it wonrsquot be because of his performance Thursday night
