             Pick a team
          First thing to do is pick a team to support having an interest in who wins will make watching the match far more excitingBut which one to go forIf you like young energetic and exciting sportsmen then why not back the Carolina PanthersTheir quarterback the highest profile player Cam Newton has a history of doing some eyecatching things during a game 
          
          Or if you like fairytale endings why not back the Denver Broncos Their 39yearold captain Peyton Manning is regarded as one of the best players everHe missed most of this season because of injury and this could be his last game a win would be the perfect way for him to retire

           Get a basic idea of whats going onNow were not going to lie the rules of American Football are a little bit complicatedBut if you get the gist of whats happening on the field then thatll helpEach team is split into two units an attacking one called the offense and a defensive one called the defence
          The team which has control of the ball will have their attacking players on the pitch and the team without it will have their defensive players onYou score by carrying the ball into the oppositions end zone thats called a touchdownWhen your team is in control of the ball you have four attempts to advance it 10 yards up the field If you succeed youll get another four attempts and that keeps happening until you score or you fail then the other team gets control of the ball   
          Eat lotsSuper Bowls last some time probably around four hours from start to finish Its because theres normally a pause between each of the attempts the teams take to move the ball called a playSo that means youll have a lot of down time between the action eating goes hand in hand with watching this sport for that very reason It means you can tuck in to hotdogs and popcorn our preferred combination without missing much of the game itselfPlus eating will give you the energy to stay awake good news as kick off is around 1115pm UK time
          Become a counsellor UKbased NFL fans are really passionate about the gameYoull be able to spot the Broncos and Panthers fans at your party a mile offTheyll be decked out in their team colours blue and orange for Denver black and light blue for Carolina and will be engrossed in the match
          When a team starts losing then why not try to console a distraught fan And trust us they will be distraughtCarolina havent been in a Super Bowl since 2004 and Denver lost badly in their last appearanceWinning this time for both sets of fans is a big dealCelebrity spotting 
          If all else fails then try to keep tabs on all the celebrities youll see on screenNot only are Coldplay and Beyonce performing at halftime but therell be tonnes of Alist Hollywood stars in the stadium watching The only trouble is therell be so many you might lose countBut most of all have fun and good luck getting up for work on MondayFor more stories like this one you can now download the BBC Newsbeat app straight to your device For iOS go here For Android go here
