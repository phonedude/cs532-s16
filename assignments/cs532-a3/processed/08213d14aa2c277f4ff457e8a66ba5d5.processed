			Ingredients2 tomatoes diced with seeds removed12 onion finely chopped13 cup of fresh basil minced1 clove of garlic minced1 teaspoon of Italian spices4 tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil1 cup of grated mozzarella cheese12 slices of baguette breadSalt and pepper to taste I use sea salt or fleur de selInstructionsIn a bowl stir all the ingredients except for the cheese and bread Set asidePlace the slices of bread on a baking sheet brush each slice with olive oil Grill in the oven until golden brown just on sideRemove baking sheet from the oven and turn you slices of bread so the grilled part is on the bottom Add about 1 tablespoon of the tomato mixture to each piece of breadTop with grated mozzarella cheeseReturn to the oven and grill until cheese is melted31
