                When it comes to the Super Bowl not even a broken arm will keep dedicated players from participating in the championship game And now with 3D printing players can compete with relative comfort and minimal impact on the injury Take for example the Carolina Panthers Thomas Davis who broke his arm a few weeks ago in the NFC title game and is now slated to play in Superbowl 50 on Sunday thanks to a successful repair surgery and a new 3Dprinted arm brace                
                

            
                Davis an AllPro outside linebacker for the Panthers broke his arm during the AFC title match against the Arizona Cardinals Davis was hurt in the second quarter when he hit Darren Fells following a catch He underwent surgery for an ulna bone fracture the day after the injury As part of the repair procedure Panthers head team physician Dr Patrick Connor inserted a plate with 12 small screws into Davis forearm                
                

            
                Related With just a few pictures of your feet Wiivv can make you a pair of custom 3D printed insoles                
                

            
                To protect the forearm during Sundays big game Davis will be wearing a 3Dprinted arm brace designed and developed by 3D printing company Whiteclouds reports CNet According to Scot Perone of 3D Elite a 3D printing company that specializes in athletic braces and helped with the Davis project the personalized brace is comprised of a protective 3Dprinted plastic polymer and is lined with Poron XD a shockabsorbing material that will protect the arm from ingame impacts                
                

            
                The brace was printed using 3D scans of Davis arm after the injury and was sent to the player this week for testing The linebacker was on the field this week with the Panthers in San Jose ahead of Sundays big game and was a full participant in the teams most recent practice which lasted for 1 hour and 15 minutes Davis reportedly selected the 3Dprinted brace after testing three other more traditional ones He chose the custom printed model for its toughness Speaking to Charlotte Observer reporter Jonathan Jones after the Panthers Wednesday practice Davis said he quottook every opportunity that I could to bump it against something and really see how it feelsquot                
                

            
                If Davis plays with the brace he will become the first NFL player to wear a piece of 3Dprinted equipment in an official league game Not only will he make history with the brace it also wont hold him back from competing at his maximum ability quotIts going to be something thats definitely manageable thats not going to affect my way of playquot Davis said to the LA Times following the practice session
