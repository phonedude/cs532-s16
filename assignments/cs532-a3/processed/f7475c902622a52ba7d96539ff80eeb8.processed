Hillary Clinton has womens issues on her agenda Does any other candidate





Megan Carpentier








It took 90 minutes for CNN to ask a question about women at the first Democratic debate Thats scary for a candidate whos said theyre vital to her win
































On a stage full of mostly men womens issues somehow just didnt come up

Hillary Clintons gender was exactly the nonissue in the first Democratic debate of the lookingupagain 2016 election that she always wanted it to be in her failed 2008 race to return to the White House
There was no need to prove that shes tough enough to be president
There was no need to answer questions about whether shes likable  let alone listening to condescending swipes about how shes likeble enough as she did from Barack Obama nearly eight years ago
On Tuesday in Las Vegas there was nobody asking her how as a woman she keeps so upbeat It was just Clinton on a stage with her four male opponents  even the ones polling around 1 against her  and everyone going toetotoe on everything from foreign policy to her damn emails to mass incarceration to income inequality
Clintons gender was finally taken as a matter of course in the campaign after months and months of mentioning what a proud grandmother she is But a strange thing happened all the way inside the Wynn hotel gender issues hardly came up at all unless Clinton brought them up herself
Though she gave the last of the debates opening statements Clintons was the first mention of women that wasnt a reference to a candidates wife or daughters I believe in equal pay for equal work for women but I also believe its about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world as well as the second and yes finally fathers will be able to say to their daughters you too can grow up to be president
After that Bernie Sanders brought up but flubbed his reference to paid family leave identifying it only as something that ought to be offered to mothers




 

You see every other major country saying to moms that when you have a baby were not going to separate you from your newborn baby because we are going to have  we are going to have medical and family paid leave like every other country on Earth


Which well research shows that equal amounts of parental leave is better for women in the work force fathers at home and children in general 
Lincoln Chafee invited voters to break down his record on a womans right to choose And sure he got 100 rating from Naral in 2004 but dropped to 65 in 2005 after voting for the confirmations of US supreme court justice John Roberts and conservative federal judge Janice Rogers Brown
Then it was nearly an hour until womens issues came up again when host Anderson Cooper asked a question about income inequality and Sanders mentioned pay equity in passing 
Clinton later used a question on Social Security to talk more at length about women who are dependent on lower Social Security checks because of past income inequality and some womens reliance on a husbands income
She also made the next reference to women in the debate I cant think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president but Im not just running because I would be the first woman president But it wasnt until after a series of questions on climate change and energy policy that host Dana Bash asked the first question about womens issues of the debate  more than 90 minutes into a 2hour deabte
Bash asked Clinton to respond to Republican candidate Carly Fiorinas criticism which is common across the Republican party that mandating paid parental leave will kill small businesses 
Clinton responded that statemandated programs in California hadnt killed off small business and that We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses 
Clinton then smartly pivoted to her own personal experience




 

I remember as a young mother you know having a baby wake up who was sick and Im supposed to be in court because I was practicing law I know what its like And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face particularly working moms


In Bashs followup she asked Clinton to respond to critics of expanding the size of government and Clinton made the only reference to Planned Parenthood of the entire debate They dont mind having big government to interfere with a womans right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood which earned solid applause
Sanders on the other hand responded to the same question by doubling down on his earlier statements that its women who should stay home with the kids and thus be the recipients of paid parental leave Every other major country on Earth every one including some small countries say that when a mother has a baby she should stay home with that baby 
In his response Martin OMalley  with his only direct statement about womens issues  mentioned both the expansion of paid leave in Maryland when he was governor and the fact that paid parental leave can help include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country and make sure that women arent penalized in having to drop out of the workforce
OMalley later closed his portion of the debate by congratulating his fellow candidates for not denigrating women  which well thats a pretty low bar 
But that was it when it came to womens issues at the first of six Democratic debates no fullthroated defense of reproductive rights no discussion of how access to abortion is becoming tantamount to the right to have one no mention of campus sexual assaults during the debates about university education no mention of girls in Stem or sexual harassment in Stem at public universities which has been in the news no real discussion of Planned Parenthood or the threatened government shutdown nothing about the Hyde Amendment or contraception access in the health care or even which women should or would be considered for potential cabinet positions 
It was as though women in America had become a side issue something brought up in passing voters not unique from the masses
And that in the end might be the most harmful thing for Clinton in 2016 having staked a bunch of her campaign thus far on the idea that womens issues are national economic issues and that they can carry her to the White House the mostly male moderators of the first Democratic debate of the primary offered her only one question about womens issues to answer and then only threequarters of the way through the debate 
If shed intended to convince the political establishment that womens issues werent just about women Hillary Clinton may have failed And that doesnt bode well for the year ahead
