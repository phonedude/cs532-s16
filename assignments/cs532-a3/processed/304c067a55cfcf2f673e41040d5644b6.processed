Super Bowl 50 An Environmental Sustainability Champion

    February 7th 2016 by Adam Johnstonnbsp
While AFC champion Denver Broncos and NFC Champion Carolina Panthers will play for all the marbles this Sunday at Levi8217s Stadium Super Bowl 50 is an environmental sustainability champion of its own
While earlier Super Bowls including Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford New Jersey in 2014 and Super Bowl XLIX last year in Glendale Arizona chartedprogress this year8217s edition is leading the waySince opening up in 2014 the home of the San Francisco 49ers garnered a lot of buzz for its hightech initiatives including stadiumwide WiFi Yet its green initiatives reallyput this stadium on the map

It8217s the first NFL stadium to have Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED Gold certification LEED acknowledges the best practices in making buildings environmentally efficient while helping to endorse renewable energy and being more costeffective
San Francisco 49ers Vice President of Stadium Operations Jim Mercurio toldSports Illustratedearlier this weekthatwaste reduction planning in developing Levi8217s Stadium was key in achieving the LEED Gold standard Mercurio said 64 of all consumer waste is recycled and87 of durable goods in the stadium is also recycledMercurio said fans have developed a better understanding of waste reduction in delivering environmental sustainabilityin the past two decades
8220What we asked people is if you arent going to walk the distance to where weve placed these bins put it in those bags Mercurio says Sure it cost more for the 49ers but they saw it as part of an education as well And while theres always room for learning to be more environmentally friendly he says it is almost comical to see how far along folks have come Twenty years ago if trash even made it into the container that was one thing Mercurio says Now they separate Fans are sophisticated and looking to educate
Solar energy is also a key playerwithin the Levi8217s Stadium green team NRG installed 375 kW of peak solar power capacity usingover 1150 panels What8217s even more impressive is the current solar energy system can produce enoughclean energy for every 49ers home game at Levi8217s Stadium NRG8217s solar installations arealong the NRG bridges which point towards the stadium from the red parking lot The other section of solar panels are on the terrace overshadowing the stadium and Silicon Valley
SunPower Chief Executive Officer Tom Werner said the company is very happy to support its business partners in championing sound environmental and economic decisions by going solar
8220This year8217s big game is making environmental history as fans root for their favorite team playing in the NFL8217s first LEED Gold certified stadium featuring SunPower high efficiency solar panels8221 Werner said
Sustainability in the NFL is continuing to grow 10NFL venues have a joint 85 MW in solar power capacity The Baltimore Ravens and Atlanta Falcons are also building solar systems With solar energy continuing its strong growth the NFL is capitalizing on the greening of professional sports movement No longer can pro sports leagues ignore climate change due to extreme weather NFL andSuper Bowl 50 are showing what is possible in developing an environmental sustainability plan It8217s the wave of the future for pro sports A wave which everyone needs to catch for our combined futurenbsp

            708217000 people who droveflew there or nearby but wait the stadium has as much solar as a few dozens homes
Sure it8217s better than nothing but really calling the event 8220sustainable8221 Please

            The stadium might be sustainable but the event certainly was not It trashed the city and pushed homeless people out of their encampments Fireworks trash made it as far as the beaches and I can only imagine the amount of singleuse everything consumed SF should be ashamed

        

    
    
        
            
                Benjamin Nead
            
        
        
            This is the trend The cities get sold on the idea that sporting events like this are going to be great moneymakers for them and in reality it8217s only a money loser    
httpwwwbizjournalscomphoenixblogbusiness201510glendalelikelylostmoremoneythanitmadeonhtml
Now these mega games are wrapped up in a greenwashed package and it turns out the the social and ecological ramifications are worse than having no event at all

        

    


    
        
            
                Omega Centauri
            
        
        
            Its a good highly visible and symbolic start But covering the quantity of energy used by the stadium during a handful of home games won8217t come close to balancing the energy books Annual consumption of the organization is going to be dominated by the day to day usage and transportation There is a very very long way to go is they want to become carbon neutral

            Well originally they were planning to shut down the streetcar lines and tear down the wires and only relented under extreme political pressure8230 I can8217t call them champions of sustainability when they considered stuff like that

        

    
    
        
            
                Riely Rumfort
            
        
        
            Think about how many SUVs are traveling todaycross country to the game or to a party how many Ovens Microwaves TV sets how many trucks of fooddrinks How much money is spent by all involved in advertising4 million for 30secs viewing paying players plane tickets consuming fans
If it were cancelled and all funds involved spent on renewables we could probably power a state 100 

        

    
    
        
            
                Benjamin Nead
            
        
        
            Yes and then there was the way the homeless were pushed around to make way for the game which from what I8217m reading is 35 miles away from downtown San Francisco
