Hundreds of protesters were gathered on the sidewalk across from San Franciscos temporary Super Bowl City around 430pm on Wednesday when a few organizers began assembling tents Decorated with slogans such as We have a right to rest and Tackle homelessness the tents were supposed to establish a Homeless Super Bowl City in protest at the fan village that has transformed several downtown plazas parks and city streets into a gated exhibition for NFL sponsors
Within minutes hundreds of police officers in riot gear surrounded the crowd and ordered them to take down the tents or risk having them confiscated 
You have one minute to disassemble the tents a police captain announced over a loudspeaker 
That is what they tell us when were on the street said Lisa GrayGarcia an activist with Poor Magazine GrayGarcia who goes by the nickname Tiny said that earlier in the day San Francisco police officers had similarly confiscated 30 tents from a homeless encampment with only one minutes notice
Just days before one of the countrys largest sporting events is set to take place with eyes on the San Francisco Bay Area Wednesdays protest highlighted tensions in the city that have persisted since long before the Broncos and the Panthers knew they were going to the Super Bowl
Residents and many elected officials have reacted with outrage to the news that San Francisco will foot the bill for nearly 5m in costs to host the week of festivities that precede the big game Thats in contrast to Santa Clara the small city about 45 miles south where the championship itself will be played which struck a deal that requires the Super Bowl host committee to reimburse it for its costs 
That information which came by way of a government budget analysis that dryly noted that the NFLs 2013 revenues of 92bn exceed San Franciscos total annual budget added insult to injury for residents of the city already feeling inconvenienced and alienated by an expensive starstudded spectacle that is increasing traffic disrupting public transportation and shutting down streets 
While different San Franciscans have used the occasion of the Super Bowl to protest about a variety of issues  including the installation of tacky Super Bowl statues the December police killing of Mario Woods and recent rate cuts for Uber drivers  the outpouring of anger on Wednesday was focused on the plight of San Franciscos homeless residents

San Francisco has the resources to end homelessness because of the tech industry and were using it instead for these big bread and circuses events said Jordan Gwendolyn Davis who attended the protest 
Instead of taking down the tents Davis and other protesters held them in the air as the crowd listened to speeches from various activists and later marched around the perimeter of Super Bowl City  a compromise the police accepted 
Davis joined the protest because she had experienced homelessness She lived on the streets for the six months when she first arrived in San Francisco she said during which time she slept under a highway overpass She later found shelter at the citys new Homeless Navigation Center and was eventually able to move into permanent housing
The citys approximately 7000 homeless residents have been thrown into a state of even greater instability and uncertainty by the big event following remarks made by Mayor Ed Lee last August 
Theyre going to have to leave the mayor said then referring to the homeless people who hang out along the Embarcadero where Super Bowl City has been erected
Jennifer Friedenbach the executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness estimates that about 60 homeless people typically spend the day or night in the footprint of Super Bowl City but the widely reported comment touched off a wave of fear and rumors within the homeless population citywide that their encampments  usually in outoftheway locations such as highway underpasses  would be cleared out in time for the arrival of Super Bowl tourists
Rumors and misinformation have persisted as assurances from the mayor that the homeless would be provided with alternative shelter are drowned out by reports of police and other city workers disassembling tents and telling homeless people to leave their locations

Dozens protested what they say is San Francisco mayor Ed Lees plan to push homeless people out of where Super Bowl festivities are being held Photograph Eric RisbergAP


Were hearing over and over from homeless people that theyre being cleared out and told to leave during the Super Bowl said Friedenbach Folks are already in crisis because theyre homeless Its really destabilizing for them to have to move somewhere else or feel threatened
Balil Ali a homeless resident of San Francisco said I dont even call it the Super Bowl I call it the toilet bowl Were throwing a penalty flag on Ed Lee for unnecessary roughness on the homeless
One positive outcome from the Super Bowl however is the surge of support for homeless residents from housed San Franciscans Many if not most of the protesters at Homeless Super Bowl City were not in fact homeless Friedenbach explained that participating in an evening protest is a challenge for those staying in shelters where curfews can be as early as 6pm or on the street where abandoning ones tent or belongings can leave one vulnerable
I think its disgusting that human beings arent able to sleep to rest to meet their basic needs in a city that has been a sanctuary to so many people said Lizzie Locker as she held a tent aloft Locker said that while she was not homeless shes been close in part because of the citys rising rents 
Like many of the protesters Davis was angered by the intensity of the police response You would respect this response if we were terrorists but were just protesting
The cost of policing and public services for the Super Bowl was an added sore point Many protesters carried signs stating that either the 5m the city is spending on the Super Bowl or the millions sponsors will shell out for television ads during the game could house 500 people immediately
