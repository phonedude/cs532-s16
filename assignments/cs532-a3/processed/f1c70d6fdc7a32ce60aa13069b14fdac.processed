Steps


Method 1

For Crown Cap Bottles







1Edit step1
Examine your environment for suitable edges crevices slots holes and shapes that might allow a bottletop to be inserted






	







2Edit step2
The easiest method is using a pair of strong scissors Open the scissors and place them slightly off parallel facing in toward the bottle against one of the ridges of the crown Cut through one of the small ridges and continue in a circle until the cap can be removed








3Edit step3
Use a spoon bigger is better put the small tip of the spoon under the cap your hand around the neck of the bottle and pop Its like a lighter but much easier and much quicker








4
Try opening the bottle with a lighter Its not as easy as youd think but its a knack which converts swear by Flatsided lighters work best


Grip the bottle firmly holding the neck in a thumbsup manner with your thumb on the cap Your fingers should be wrapped around the neck of the bottle the top finger should leave a lighters width from the cap




Insert the lighter bottom between your top finger and the bottom of the cap aiming above the centre of the bone between your knuckle and first finger joint such that the lighter is perpendicular to the finger bone




Tighten your grip of the bottle and wrap that lighter lever around your finger If youre holding the bottle right the cap will pop off Try it a few times to get the grip right and it wont hurt











5
Super or stupid Party trick The key is leverage and not impeding ie touching the cap in any way except for the lever Use the largest knuckle of the index finger as the fulcrum for your lever google fulcrum and think of the Bic lighter as the lever see below This method can easily forcefully and loudly launch the bottle cap more than 10 feet 30m in the air depending on the bottle Ive gotten some good loud launches with Samuel Adams but most any pry off beer cap will do Do NOT agitate the bottle  it is NOT necessary Due to the possible forceful ejection of the cap be aware of your eyes and face  a bottle cap to the eye could cause permanent damage The old style fullsize Bic lighter which is somewhat oval shaped works well due to its dimensions and its tendency to grip the underside of the cap with limited slippage








6Edit step6
Try vending machines These are useful because they have a handy recessed coin return Stick the cap in there and push down firmly Use only strong metal installations





7
Try household items It may be a hunt to find something effective

Belt buckles work if they are the right shape A spatula will work if you use the side




A common fork is a quick and easy method Using one of the forks teeth as a lever push the grooves of the crown up and away from the cap one at a time




Childrens ice skates may also work The best skates for this purpose are the expensive ones with hollow sections in the blade Unfortunately most people dont have those sort




Car seat belt latches are the right shape for opening bottles This is not recommended If an alcoholic beverage is spilled in the car it could lead to some very interesting questions if you are pulled over




Metal nail clippers can be used to crimp off the lid Open the clipper end as wide as possible wedge one edge under the cap and pry upwards You should hear the compressed air being released Go around the cap until it falls off
Use the door handle that is located on the side of the door that is not open apply pressure at an angle and voila its open for you




A peeler such as one you would use for a potato works alright Hold the neck hold the peeler upside down an upward curve unlike when you peel a potato Get the curve under each edge and pry each one off one by one It should spin but not come off Then take the peeler still upsidedown put it under one of the edges and keep pushing should pop right off




Take two bottles it is possible to open one of them  simply use the side of the cap as the lighter described above but be careful if you dont use the side of the cap you might ending up opening the top one



A paint can opener the metal ones with the ring on the end work really well Just put the nub at the top of the inside of the ring under the cap like a regular bottle opener
The side of a regular radiator is usually rather efficient and spilling your beloved beverage is not too much of a problem Just place the stickingout part of the cap on the sharp edge of the radiator and pull down quickly and sharply
Hotel hangers the kind you cant steal simply place the bottle under the bar insert the cap into the hanger where its connected to bar and pop like a normal bottle opener
A rubber jar opener  simply squeeze tightly over the cap twist and pull

A hammer works great Turn it upside down pry the forked end under the cap edges and work your way around the cap EASY and safe if youre comfortable using a hammer




You can actually open a bottle using a piece of computer paper thicker the better Fold the paper in half as many times as you can then hold the bottle in a similar manner as you would if attempting to open the bottle with a lighter Tightly wedge the corner of the folded paper under the cap edge and using as much force as you can pry open the cap It may take a few attempts rotating the bottle each time to loosen the cap edges around the bottle This method will certainly impress your audience though it is one of the more challenging ways to open a bottle Watch your hands it is very easy to nick one of your knuckles holding the paper on the crown edge










	









Method 2

Metallic Objects







8Edit step1
One great tool is a staple remover Insert the two teeth upwards underneath the cap and pull up Repeat this a couple times around the cap and it comes off no problems








9Edit step2
Also consider using the prongs from a lamp or other electrical device The prongs slip easily under the cap Work around the edge and the cap can easily be removed








10Edit step3
Try sticking the bottle into a door jamb at the metal plate Close the door and twist the bottle down and you might not lose any contents A potential stained carpet from a spill reduces this methods attractiveness








11Edit step4
Alternatively place the edge of the bottle cap on any edge preferably metal Hit it with the palm of your hand Dont use wooden edges or you ruin them








12Edit step5
A wedding or class ring is an ideal way to remove a soda or beer bottle cap Warning Gold wedding rings may be pulled out of shape using this method  you risk the wrath of your spouse by doing this Simply hold the bottle in the nonring hand and place the ring hand palm down over the bottle cap Hook the ring on the edge of the cap farthest from the palm of your hand with the proper pressure the cap will pop off Depending on the shape of the ring you may experience some pain on the top of the ring finger and opening many bottles in a row may result in swelling so use common sense If it hurts too much or your finger swells stop








13Edit step6
Note that you can pry off the cap with virtually any strong metal with an edge that you have handy Simply grab the neck of the bottle with the top of your hand even with the bottom of the cap Lay the spoon handle knife blade sharp edge facing away or whatever across the third knuckle on your first finger Hook under the edge of the cap and pry up If the metal is wide enough it doesnt put enough pressure on your hand to actually hurt








14Edit step7
You can use the back edge of a Chefs knife use a knife with a wide enough blade so that the sharp edge is not on your skin the handle of a serving spoon tongs a stainless bowl closed scissors a stapler a screwdriver a putty knife a cocktail strainer handle Even a car key can work eventually but youll probably tear up your cuticles pretty badly If you dont care about the finish on the item a hairbrush handle a ceramic coaster a remote control a soup spoon a hardcover book a CD case again anything with an edge








15Edit step8
A pair of standard handcuffs make a good bottle opener and often a simultaneous conversationstarter Push the single strand swinging part of the handcuff through the ratchet and hold it so that there is a gap of about 34 19 cm between the double strand and single strand Rest the single strand against the top of the cap and hook the bottom of the double strand under the cap Use the handcuffs to lever the cap off Use only goodquality NIJcertified handcuffs as cheaper novelty handcuffs may be damaged by this process






	









Method 3

The Rubber Band Method







16Edit step1
Wrap a rubber band around the metal cap








17Edit step2
Twist as hard as you can if you still cannot turn the cap wrap a thin cloth around it and try again






	









Method 4

The Key Method







18Edit step1
Hold the bottle tightly in one hand by the neck so that the tip of your thumb is pushing up against the little bumps on the cap








19Edit step2
Take the key in the other hand and put it between your thumb and the cap so that key is jammed up under one of the bumps on the side of the cap Try different teeth on the key and pick one that you can get under the edge of the cap








20Edit step3
Pressing the key under the cap as hard as possible with the tip of your thumb twist the key to pull the side of the cap away from the bottle








21Edit step4Once a bump is pulled out turn the bottle a tiny bit and pull out the next bump








22Edit step5
Keep going around the cap pulling out the bumps As you go the space under the cap gets bigger and it gets easier to get the key point under the cap








23Edit step6
After going about halfway around you should be able to remove the key and keeping your same grip on the bottle push the cap off with the tip of your thumb






	









Method 5

Opening Wine Bottles







24Edit step1
Push the cork into the bottle It works although it is difficult with older wines which may have penetrated the cork Use a blunt instrument for maximum pressure If you wish to ensure no spillages do it in a sink No one likes cleaning wine off carpets






	









Method 6

The Thermal Expansion Lighter Method







25Edit step1
When heat energy is added to a material the particle collisions speed up and travel farther apart therefore weakening the attractive forces in the substance Thus the substance expands Applying this knowledge of thermodynamics the crown cap metal can be removed Run the flame of a lighter around the cap of the bottle then use something else to pry the lid off knife counter etc This will make opening the bottle much much easier than simply trying to pry the lid off Remember though the mouthneck of the bottle may temporarily be hot










Method 7

The Knife Method







26Edit step1
Hold the bottle pointing neck downwards from the base foil removed








27Edit step2
Rest a table knife blunt edge leading against the neck








28Edit step3
Slide the knifes blunt edge down the neck until it clicks against the glass ridge that marks the start of the foil area Do it again slightly more forcefully again and again until you hear the click sound change to a crack You have neatly severed the glass neck but the cork keeps it in place








4
Wearing your gloves twist the severed glass end off hopefully taking the cork with it Blow any glass dust off into the sink








30Edit step5
If the cork did not follow the glass end you must get a pair of pliers or similar to remove the cork since the glass is chipped and may be sharp










Method 8

The Screw Method







31Edit step1
You will need a deepthreaded screw such as a decking screw a screwdriver a hammer and a prying surface at relatively the same height as the wine bottles top








32Edit step2
Drive the screw into the center of the cork leaving a small 12 inch13 centimeters amount out








3
Use the hammer against the prying surface to pull the cork out of the bottle by the screw head


Even better yet just screw a screw into the cork until it clearly penetrates the cork Now just pour the wine through the cork Voila We are drinking now It may pour slowly but you wont get hurt If you need a screw unscrew one from something in your house and then put it back afterwards Drink the whole bottle or seal the top with bubble gum your choice










Method 9

The Banging on the Wall Method







34Edit step1
Take a kitchen rug and fold it so that its just a bit larger than the bottom of the bottle








35Edit step2
Put the rug over the bottom of the bottle and then holding the rug in place bang the bottom of the bottle against a wall The movement of the bottle should be in the direction of its longest axis and perpendicular to the wall








3
Keep doing that increasing the force of the blows and the cork will slowly ease out of the bottle


If you dont have a kitchen rug handy a thick sneaker may be used instead Simply take off your or a friends shoe and place the bottle of wine in the sneaker so the wine bottle is sitting snug inside of the sneaker Holding the wine bottle steady inside of the shoe drive the shoe into a wall banging it as flat as possible A few good blows against the wall should get you on your way Beware the cork may pop out completely spilling the wine everywhere Keep an eye on the cork once it is sticking out of the bottle enough to grab stop the slamming and simply use your hand to pull out the cork
This doesnt work with all bottles and the wine may feel a bit bubbly after that  leave it open for a few minutes to settle before drinking if you can wait that long
There might be a problem with the wooden houses that are common in the USA Works well with brick houses that are mostly used in Europe An alternative to a wall is a door frame  it must be a solid flat surface










Method 10

The Chain Link Fence Method







37Edit step1
Most if not all chain link fences have a very thick pole with several metal rings around it either at the corner or at the end These rings provide an angled lip which are ideal for opening bottles








38Edit step2
Angle the bottle so the rim of the cap is on the lip of the ring and the neck of the bottle is pressing against the outside of the ring





39Edit step3
Strike the bottle neck with your other palm in a downwards motion that pushes the bottle down Continue until the cap pops off Remember that the bottle will come down with some force so keep it straight Also the cap will likely shoot off somewhere be careful not to injure yourself or others Enjoy your freshly opened bottle
