              Chicken wings are low carb paleo Are chicken wings diabetic friendly Yes and yes

How to make low carb paleo chicken wings
Naked chicken wings are paleo and diabetes friendly

nbsp
I ate chicken wings throughout my youth and adultyearsWhen I was diagnosed with diabetes I knew I had to give up some of the foods I8217d eaten all my life
low carb paleo chicken wings
nbsp
Soon after a diagnosis I realized that the 8220ADA Way8221 of 8216Carb up and Shoot Up8217 was harmful I began to lower carb intake and increase animal fats and meats I was ELATED when I learned I could eat many of my favorite foods from my past8230 like low carb paleo chicken wings
nbsp
The Devil is in the Details
Yes chicken wings can be low carb paleo and truly diabetes friendly if you use quality spices and real butter 8230 but they can also be sugary glutenous 8216junk8217
It8217s all in the preparation If you buy in a restaurant I always make sure to tell them that I am diabetic and that I need to make sure there is no breading and NO sugar
In other words I want these sugar free and NAKED  Naked chicken wings is the term we use for breadingfree wings I rarely eat chicken wings in restaurants for this reason
Note Most restaurants will fry their wings in vegetable oils I avoid vegetable oils
However the great news is8230 you can make these easily at home by baking and broiling Yes it takes time and effort but it is a simple process
nbsp
Low Carb Paleo Chicken Wings
While many were preparing carb and sugar rich 8220treats8221 for the Super Bowl gatherings 8230 I prepared a very low carb paleo and diabetic friendly meal including chicken wings
nbsp


Separating the leg from the wing tips
First you can either cut your own wings or buy them precut I prefer to cut my own  You want to separate the drummette from the wing tip Once they are cut you simply place them on a broiler pan and sprinkle with your favorite seasonings
In the picture above mine are ready to go into theoven with only pepperand cajun spice 
nbsp
Baking and Broiling

IF you are in a hurry you can simply broil the wings on one side until proper crispiness flip and repeat
I prefer to bake  350 degrees for about an hour then broil for 510 mins until crispy 
Next I turn the wings over and repeat the process my family prefers their wings very crispy we do not like them 8220wet8221 My youngest son said as a child 8220I don8217t like them slippery8221 Good man  I really like them dry and wet
We are headed for the home stretch
nbsp
Chicken Wing Coatings
Slap Ya Mama
It will not be long now and succulent spicy wings will be YOURS  
When you place the wings under the broiler for the last time begin to prepare a large glass bowlfor the final step To do this add your favorite pepper sauce  I use Texas Pete  a few tablespoons of butter and your favorite spices The spices I used are black pepper red pepper paprika and Slap Ya Mama cajun spices
nbsp
Once the wings have reached perfect crispiness remove from the oven and begin placing the wings in the saucespice bowl I used a large plastic spoon to turn the wings to make sure they are evenly coated
I usually can8217t wait so I begin to dig in almost immediately8230 however the seasonings will soak in to the wings and they will actually taste better after sitting 8230 just microwave to reheat
Note A large plastic tub with a lid works great for the coating process you can shake rattle and roll the wings for maximum coating BUT after coating remove the lid If you leave the lid on  the heat and moisture will build up and 8220wrinkle8221 the wings
That8217s it8230HOPE YOU ENJOY 
nbsp
Chicken Wings Nutritious and Delicious
Chicken wings are full of healthy fats and proteins If you use truly healthy means to cook spice and coat them8230 they can be an important food for you
My family and friends love these low carb paleo chicken wings  It8217s a win win win
