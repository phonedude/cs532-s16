Comments         The NY Jets can learn one major concept from both teams that are in Super Bowl 50 Itrsquos so simple that if followed it wouldnbspyield incredible results fornbspthe future The Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos are set to face off in the big game With a ton of coverage these past few weeks every angle you can think of being discussed it all comes down to two of the best teams of the year battling it out for their chance to hoist the Vince Lombardi trophy Stay connected with The Jet PressFollow TheJetPressWhen it comes to the Jets they had a chance to make some noise in the NFL Playoffs last season All the cards aligned just right for them to control their own ticket into the postseason All they had to do was ldquowin and get inrdquo against their AFC East rival Buffalo Bills Unfortunately as we all know the Jets fell flat and lost Plus to add more insult to injury it was against their exhead coach Rex Ryan No matter what anyone says I truly believe last season was a success for the Jets They went 106 compared to their 412 of last season and overachieved in their first year under a brand new leadership regime More from The Jet PressNY Jets Top 5

Spotlight Chris Ivory1d ago One major theme the Jets can take away from both the Panthers and Broncos that has really plagued this team for decades now is not having a true franchise quarterback that is elite enough to carry this team to greater heights The Jets came very close but in the end failed to have that one consistent quarterback that lasted for more than a decade in bringing results year in year out Or at the very least a truly dynamic gamechanging quarterback that got better every passing season Looking at Peyton Manning and Cam Newton respectively anyone can easily see the impact they bring to their teams Whether itrsquos a pure gunslinger like Manning or a hybrid dualthreat kind of athletenbsplike Newton these are two quarterbacks that have consistently improved over time and put their teams in a position to win plenty of football games Both teams over the course of the past few years were also smart enough to continue building support around theirnbspfranchise quarterbacks Whether it was bringing in better offensive linemen or receiving targets it all comes down to who is under center and what playmakers around him can push the envelope to get to where they are now More Jets How to throw an awesome Super Bowl 50 bash Overall the Jets need to finally have their franchise quarterback in place and committed to push this teamnbspto its true potential Whether itrsquos Geno Smith Bryce Petty or someone in the future the time is now to look at the success of both Super Bowl 50 teams and realize it all comes down to who is quarterbacknbspHopefully the cards align sometime in the future that the Jets can finally enjoy major success with having a franchise quarterbacknbspestablished and ready to take care of business          Please enable JavaScript to
