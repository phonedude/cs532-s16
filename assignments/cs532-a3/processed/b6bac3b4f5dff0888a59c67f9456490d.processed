JustificationThis species is classified as Critically Endangered because it has a small population which is likely to be declining owing to continuing habitat destruction and degradation in its small range Its prospects are currently uncertain as statistics on forest loss on Anjouan are unreliable However recent evidence suggests that it can adapt to humanaffected forest areas where large trees remain and a recent study suggests that the population may be considerably larger than previously feared Given this new information the species may warrant downlisting in the future

Taxonomic noteOtus rutilus Sibley and Monroe 1990 1993 has been split into O pembaensis following Fry et al 1988 O capnodes following Dowsett and ForbesWatson 1993 and more recently into O madagascariensis and O mayottensis following Rasmussen et al 2000 and O rutilus with species limits accordingly revised    
Identification2022 cm Small eared darkcoloured owl Two colour forms both are barred streaked and vermiculated one is dark ashybrown and the other paler rufousbrown with pale grey facial disc bordered black Both frequently seen together Voice Distinct drawnout whistle often repeated and separated by short interludes  



Distribution and populationThis species was rediscovered on Anjouan  Ndzuani in the Comoro Islands in June 1992 after an absence of records dating back to 1886 At least several tens of pairs probably 100200 pairs were estimated to survive in 1999 R Safford in litt 1999 and although a survey in 1995 produced a maximum estimate of only 96 individuals Moorcroft 1996 differences between these two estimates may be due to sampling techniques Surveys in 2006 found the bird to be abundant in suitable habitat and encouragingly found individuals in degraded habitats down to 300 m and it has also been sighted at sea level H Doulton in litt 2006 2010 C Marsh in litt 2007 2009 This survey estimated the population to be somewhere between the two previous estimates at 50100 pairs C Marsh in litt 2007 2009 Surveys carried out in 20102011 suggested that the species may be frequent in degraded forest with habitat modelling giving a potential range of 934 km2 Density was estimated at 053 birds per hectare 044063 95 CI meaning that the total population may be significantly higher than previously thought and possibly as high as 4950 individuals 36416632 95 CI however further work is needed to confirm this K Green in litt 2010 2011 Lloyd 2010 Field surveys from MayJuly 2010 dry season and November 2010April 2011 wet season estimated the population at 3466 individuals 26544526 95 CI during the dry season and 5464 individuals 42327054 95 CI in the wet season Green et al 2015 Densities were estimated at 055 individuals ha1 042072 95 CI and 087 individuals ha1 067112 95 CI for the dry and wet seasons respectivelyPopulation justificationThe population has been estimated at 50100 pairs C Marsh in litt 2007 2009 however surveys carried out in 20102011 suggested that the species may be more widespread and frequent in degraded forest with habitat modelling giving a potential range of 934 km2 Density was estimated at 053 birds per hectare 044063 95 CI meaning that the total population may be significantly higher than previously thought and possibly as high as 4950 individuals 36416632 95 CI K Green in litt 2010 2011 Lloyd 2010 A recently published paper that collected data in 20102011 estimated the population at 3466 individuals16026544526 95 CI160during the dry season and 5464 in the wet season16042327054 95 CI160Green et al 2015 The population is currently precautionarily maintained in the band 50249 mature individuals This equates to 75374 individuals in total rounded here to 70400 individualsTrend justificationIt is suspected to be decreasing rapidly owing primarily to habitat clearance and perhaps also predation and competition from invasive speciesEcologyIt survives in remaining fragments of native upland forest degraded forest and plantations and appears to be dependent on large trees with cavities for nesting and roosting usually on steep slopes Safford 1993 Surveys in 20102011 found the species to be commonest in native forest with significantly lower densities in degraded forest and lower densities still in plantations and it also occurs in agroforestry with natural or nonnatural understorey vegetation K Green in litt 2011 Green et al 2015 It has been recorded perching in thick cover 315 m from the ground Lewis 1996 and roosting 34 m off the ground on the bottom branch of a tree fern H Doulton in litt 2006 2010 Insects are believed to form at least part of its diet Safford 1993 It is thought to breed between August and December during the wet season Green et al 2015ThreatsHabitat clearance for agriculture timber extraction and charcoal manufacture is ongoing Lewis 1996 Safford 2001 K Green in litt 2010 Between 19902000 the country suffered from the fourth highest rate of deforestation in the world Remaining habitat is becoming increasingly degraded through human disturbance and invasion by exotic plants such as Rubus rosifolius and Lantana camara Safford 1993 Introduced Black Rat Rattus rattus is abundant in the forest and may predate nests Safford 1993 The introduced Common Myna Acridotheres tristis may compete for nest holes Safford 1993 H Doulton in litt 2006 2010 C Marsh in litt 2007 2009  Severe cyclones are a regular threat to remaining forest fragments Safford 2001 Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II Longterm ongoing developments that will benefit wildlife in general include a familyplanning programme environmental education projects and the formation of a nongovernmental environmental organisation Ulanga Safford 1993 The UNDP in partnership with the government planned to implement a largescale reserve covering Mount Ntingrui from around 2009 The creation of a protected area network for the Comoros Islands is still ongoing with the Moya Forest in addition to Mount Ntingrui proposed as potential areas for protection Green et al 2015 A participatory conservation project has been ongoing on Anjouan since 2008 H Doulton in litt 2006 2010 K Green in litt 2010 Activities centre on improving livelihoods and agricultural productivity helping communities to collectively manage their natural resources such as water and monitoring biodiversity patterns across all three islands to help prioritise areas for wildlife protection Bristol Conservation and Science Foundations BCSF project in the Comoros Engagement Communautaire pour le Developpement Durable ECDD is taking a communityled landscape management approach towards the protection of forest and biodiversity in the Moya Forest region of Anjouan Actions include intensification of agricultural practices to reduce the demand for land improving soil fertility through terracing and the integration of livestock management into agricultural practices and the development of alternative revenue streams such as through market gardening K Green H Doulton and B Daniel in litt 2012 Research aiming to establish a longterm monitoring scheme and recommend conservation actions to assist the preservation of the species began in 2010 K Green in litt 2010 2011Conservation Actions ProposedContinue monitoring to confirm the population size and carry out additional research on the ecology and behaviour of the species including researching its requirements for food resources and nest sites thus investigating why this species appears to be dependent on forested areas and has low presence in plantations Although it has been found to be less dependent on pristine forest than previously feared the species occurs at its highest densities in undisturbed forest and conservation measures proposed should thus focus on the conservation of forest ecosystems complemented with awareness raising for the species both nationally and internationally  Additional measures such as the provision of nestboxes in secondary forest Moorcroft 1996 and establishing a captive population as insurance against extinction Safford 1993 may not be necessary if the species is confirmed to have a much larger population than was once suspected
