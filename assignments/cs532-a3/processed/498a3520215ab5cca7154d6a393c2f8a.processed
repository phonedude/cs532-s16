Native American Youth Suicide Rates Are At Crisis Levels
The numbers are staggering

Five years ago psychiatrist R Dale Walker was invited to a small Northern Plains reservation that had suffered 17 suicides in eight months It was there listening in anbspgroup therapy meeting that he first heard the phrase grieved out
Walker who specializes in American Indian psychiatric issues and is himself a Cherokeenbspfelt overwhelmed at the toll that suicide was taking on reservations and Indian communities
One of the most difficult things to hear is when the community says We can grieve no more Were cried out We just cant respond anymore to thenbspproblemnbsphe said It really does have an impact
Walker has become more attuned to this sense of being too exhausted to grieve with each new call to an American Indian community that is facing an unusually high rate of suicide
Suicide looks very different in Native communities than it does in the general population Nationally suicide tends to skew middleaged and white but among Native Americans 40 percent of those who die by suicide are between the ages ofnbsp15 and 24 And among young adults ages 18 to 24 Native American have higher rates of suicide than any other ethnicity and higher than the general population
Anbspnewnbspreportnbsppublished by the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics highlights what Native American health experts have long known Suicide among Native youth is a crisisnbspand one that is not receiving the attention it needs
We always focus on nonHispanic white males in particular because they do represent the vast bulk of the problem lead researcher ArialdinbspMinintildeo a statistician told The Huffington Post But it seems to me that the American Indians are particularly vulnerable here as a group I dont know if that is always represented and taken into account
The report is also notable because it is not a typical analysis for the CDC It was the passion project of two collegeaged summer interns who wanted to investigate the suicide data for their age group Minintildeo explainednbspIn isolating this age group and deciding to include data on American IndiansAlaskan Natives groups often left out of analyses because of the quality of the reporting the team uncovered this unexpected disparity which Minintildeo acknowledged as shocking
Data on Native American deaths are inexact he explained because individuals who selfidentify as Native American in one survey may not be listed as such on their death certificate In other words the numbers used in this report for Native American suicides likely undercount the actual figure

Dana Alonzo the director of the Suicide Prevention Research Program at Columbia University hopes that the CDC will change its mind andnbspcontinue its reporting on this age groupnbsp
Weve had very limited success in reducing the rate of suicides in the US that occur each year she said The better we can be at knowing who tonbsptarget the more likely we will be to have an impact
Walker director of the One Sky Center a resource center for American Indian health also praised the report saying researchers need the most uptodate informationnbsp
The youth suicide rate can vary wildly from one tribe to another While some tribes may have a youth suicide rate three times the national average another tribes rate might benbspten timesnbspthe average notes The Washington Post
The causes of suicide are complex and include a range of factors not all of which are always apparent Mental illness plays a role in almost 90 percent of suicides according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness and such conditions are often treatable In the case of the AIAN community mental health resources are in short supplynbspand dont always reach them
The Indian Health Services department which delivers care to 22 million AIAN continues to be underfunded Its budget technically increased 56 percent from 2006 to 2015 but in constant 2001 dollars thats an increase of only 33 percent the department reports IHS perperson spending is only about 3000 as compared to roughlynbsp8000 spent on healthcare per personnbspby the general population
These relatively small communities are also at much higher risk than the national average for other health issues Native Americans are more likely to die of alcoholrelated causesnbspand the incidence of diabetes and tuberculosis are higher than average As a group they also have the highest rate ofnbspintimate partner violencenbspin the US while AIAN children are at double the risk for abuse and neglect




IHS


The IHS budget from 2006 to 2015



All these factors includingnbsphigh rates of povertynbspandnbspunemployment help foment a sense of loss and despair among Native youth Walker said And he suggested piecemeal intervention tactics to stop youth suicides just arent going to cut it anymorenbsp
American Indian communities are working to combat some of the contributing factors This includes advocating for the power to prosecute nonIndians for crimes committed on a reservation crucial for domestic violence cases and confronting social forces likenbspbullyingnbspand sexual abuse Evidencebased practices on this issue are still emergingnbsp

Smoking
Smoking has long been linked with depression though its a chickenoregg scenario People who are depressionprone may be more likely to take up the habit 

However nicotine is known to affect neurotransmitter activity in the brain resulting in higher levels of dopamine and serotonin which is also the mechanism of action for antidepressant drugs 

This may explain the addictive nature of the drug and the mood swings that come with withdrawal as well as why depression is associated with smoking cessation Avoiding cigarettes  and staying smoke free  could help balance your brain chemicals

Thyroid Disease
When the thyroid a butterflyshaped gland in the neck doesnt produce enough thyroid hormone its known as hypothyroidism and depression is one of its symptoms 

This hormone is multifunctional but one of its main tasks is to act as a neurotransmitter and regulate serotonin levels 

If you experience new depression symptoms  particularly along with cold sensitivity constipation and fatigue  a thyroid test couldnt hurt Hypothyroidism is treatable with medication

Poor Sleep Habits
Its no surprise that sleep deprivation can lead to irritability but it could also increase the risk of depression

A 2007 study found that when healthy participants were deprived of sleep they had greater brain activity after viewing upsetting images than their wellrested counterparts which is similar to the reaction that depressed patients have noted one of the study authors

If you dont sleep you dont have time to replenish brain cells the brain stops functioning well and one of the many factors that could lead to is depression says Matthew Edlund MD director of the Center for Circadian Medicine in Sarasota Fla and author of The Power of Rest

Facebook Overload
Spending too much time in chat rooms and on socialnetworking sites A number of studies now suggest that this can be associated with depression particularly in teens and preteens 

Internet addicts may struggle with reallife human interaction and a lack of companionship and they may have an unrealistic view of the world Some experts even call it Facebook depression 

In a 2010 study researchers found that about 12 percent of people ages 16 to 51 spent an inordinate amount of time online and that they had a higher rate of moderate to severe depression 

However the researchers noted that it is not clear if Internet overuse leads to depression or if depressed people are more likely to use the Internet

End Of A TV Show Or Movie
When something important comes to an end like a TV show movie or a big home renovation it can trigger depression in some people

In 2009 some Avatar fans reported feeling depressed and even suicidal because the movies fictional world wasnt real There was a similar reaction to the final installments of the Harry Potter movies 

People experience distress when theyre watching primarily for companionship said Emily MoyerGus PhD assistant professor of communication at Ohio State University in Columbus With Avatar MoyerGus suspects people were swept up in a narrative forgetting about real life and their own problems

Where You Live
You can endlessly debate whether city or country life is better But research has found that people living in urban settings do have a 39 percent higher risk of mood disorders than those in rural regions 

A 2011 study in the journal Nature offers an explanation for this trend City dwellers have more activity in the part of the brain that regulates stress And higher levels of stress could lead to psychotic disorders 

Depression rates also vary by country and state Some states have higher rates of depression and affluent nations having higher rates than lowincome nations 

Even altitude may play a role with suicide risk going up with altitude

Too Many Choices
The sheer number of options available  whether its face cream breakfast cereal or appliances  can be overwhelming Thats not a problem for shoppers who pick the first thing that meets their needs according to some psychologists However some people respond to choice overload by maximizing or exhaustively reviewing their options in the search for the very best item Research suggests that this coping style is linked to perfectionism and depression

Lack Of Fish In The Diet
Low intake of omega3 fatty acids found in salmon and vegetable oils may be associated with a greater risk of depression 

A 2004 Finnish study found an association between eating less fish and depression in women but not in men 

These fatty acids regulate neurotransmitters like serotonin which could explain the link Fish oil supplements may work too at least one study found they helped depression in people with bipolar disorder

Poor Sibling Relationships
Although unhappy relationships with anyone can cause depression a 2007 study in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that men who didnt get along with their siblings before age 20 were more likely to be depressed later in life than those who did 

Although its not clear whats so significant about sibling relationships the same wasnt true for relationships with parents researchers suggest that they could help children develop the ability to relate with peers and socialize 

Regardless of the reason too much squabbling is associated with a greater risk of developing depression before age 50

Birth Control Pills
Like any medication the pill can have side effects Oral contraceptives contain a synthetic version of progesterone which studies suggest can lead to depression in some women 

The reason is still unknown says Hilda Hutcherson MD clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University in New York 

It doesnt happen to everyone but if women have a history of depression or are prone to depression they have an increased chance of experiencing depression symptoms while taking birth control pills Dr Hutcherson says 

Some women just cant take the pill thats when we start looking into alternative contraception like a diaphragm which doesnt contain hormones

Rx Medications
Depression is a side effect of many medications For example Accutane and its generic version isotretinoin are prescribed to clear up severe acne but depression and suicidal thoughts are a potential risk for some people 

Depression is a possible side effect for anxiety and insomnia drugs including Valium and Xanax Lopressor prescribed to treat high blood pressure cholesterollowering drugs including Lipitor and Premarin for menopausal symptoms 

Read the potential side effects when you take a new medication and always check with your doctor to see if you might be at risk
