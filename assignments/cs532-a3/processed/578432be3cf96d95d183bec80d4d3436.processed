Paul Krugman has entered the healthcare reform fray on behalf of Hillary Clinton a fact which will no doubt disappoint many progressives In a oped titled 8220Health Reform Realities8221 Krugman argues  that though Obamacare is 8220a kludge a somewhat awkward clumsy device with lots of moving parts8221 it works
Health reform is the signature achievement of the Obama presidency It was the biggest expansion of the social safety net since Medicare was established in the 1960s It more or less achieves a goal 8212 access to health insurance for all Americans 8212 that progressives have been trying to reach for three generations And it is already producing dramatic results with the percentage of uninsured Americans falling to record lows
In other words the Affordable Care Act was a big win for us against Republicans who fought any reform at all Most will remember the failed Bill Clinton attempt to get healthcare reform done during his administration As Krugman puts it
The question for progressives 8212 a question that is now central to the Democratic primary 8212 is whether these failings mean that they should relitigate their own biggest political success in almost half a century and try for something better
Most Democrats probably agree that single payer is better than what we have It is what most of us wanted to begin with after all But how practical is it as a goal Krugman reminds us that we barely got Obamacare even with a Democratic controlled Senate If single payer had been a possibility we would already have it
But we don8217t
This is a big bone of contention now between Sanders and Clinton Jason Easley wrote here regarding the Democratic debate

Former Sec of State Clinton8217s argument is that the country should not tear up with Affordable Care Act and start over again with a new debate would set the country back Bernie Sanders argued that his Medicare for all plan would cover the 29 million people who still don8217t have healthcare






Sanders said what this debate is really about is whether 8220we have the guts to stand up to the health insurance industry and the pharmaceutical companies Clinton pointed out that during the ACA debate Democrats could not get support for the public option Clinton clearly has been shaped by her experience in the 1990s of trying to pass healthcare reform The debate within the Democratic Party comes down to whether Democrats should stay on ACA path or take a shot at Medicare for all
In Krugman8217s opinion the candidates should 8220focus their main efforts on other issues8221 You know those we haven8217t already won even if the victory was not all we had hoped for Krugman lists the many problems with pushing for single payer including the massive influence of the insurance companies the necessity of raising taxes to pay for it 8211 not only the rich but the middle class 8211 and the disruption to people who already have insurance they are satisfied with
Krugman makes a powerful argument when he says 8220progressives must set some priorities8221 and calls Sander8217s goal of single payer 8220a quixotic attempt at a doover not of a political failure but of health reform 8212 their biggest victory in many years8221 Any president only has so much political capital There are battles we haven8217t fought and won 8211 to any degree whatsoever 8211 that it might make more reasonable objectives for an incoming president
