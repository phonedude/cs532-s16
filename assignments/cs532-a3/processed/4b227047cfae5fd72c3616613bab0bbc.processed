				In a shocking reversal of policy US Customs and Border Protection agents are being told to release illegal immigrants and no longer order them to appear at deportation hearings essentially a license to stay in the United States a key agent testified Thursday

Whats more the stand down order includes a requirement that the whereabouts of illegals released are not to be tracked

We might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether suggested agent Brandon Judd president of the National Border Patrol Council

The willful failure to show up for court appearances by persons that were arrested and released by the Border Patrol has become an extreme embarrassment for the Department of Homeland Security It has been so embarrassing that DHS and the US attorneys office has come up with a new policy he testified before the immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee

The biggest change Undocumented immigrants are no longer given a notice to appear order because they simply ignore them Judd said that border agents jokingly refer to the NTAs as notices to disappear

The Department of Homeland Security however said that the government continues to be strict on the border

The US Border Patrol continues to enforce immigration laws consistent with the departments enforcement priorities which are focused on border security national security and public safety As secretary Jeh Johnson has said many times our border is not open to illegal migration and those who do so will be sent back said spokesman Michael Friel

He added The Border Patrols resources are most effectively focused on the border  prioritizing the apprehension and removal of individuals attempting to unlawfully enter the United States Our removal numbers reflect that Border Patrol agents are issuing Notices to Appear consistent with law regulation and the departments enforcement priorities

								Speaker Ryan Pelosi praise Scalia
								
									House Speaker Paul Ryan praised the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia as someone who did more to advance originalism and judicial restraint than anyone in our time
Ryan a Wisconsin Republican was among dozens of House lawmakers who reacted to the sudden death of Scalia who like both Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was a practicing Catholic
The passing of this brilliant jurist is a great loss but his writingswith their plain language and constitutional mooringswill guide generations to come Ryan said A devout Catholic he was fond of quoting St Paul who commanded us to think soberly That Justice Scalia did always and our republic is better for it

Judd said the the new policy makes mandatory the release without an NTA of any person arrested by the Border Patrol for being in the country illegally as long as they do not have a previous felony arrest conviction and as long as they claim to have been continuously in the United States since January of 2014 The operative word in this policy is claim The policy does not require the person to prove they have been here which is the same burden placed on them during deportation proceedings Instead it simply requires them to claim to have been here since January of 2014

But even then he added the agency has been told not to track the illegals

Not only do we release these individuals that by law are subject to removal proceedings we do it without any means of tracking their whereabouts Agents believe this exploitable policy was set in place because DHS was embarrassed at the sheer number of those who choose not to follow the law by showing up for their court appearances In essence we pull these persons out of the shadows and into the light just to release them right back to those same shadows from whence they came he said

The go free policy he said has prompted thousands of Latinos to cross the border and among them are hundreds of criminal foot soldiers according to other testimony

Immigration laws today appear to be mere suggestions There are little or no consequences for breaking the laws and that fact is well known in other countries If government agencies like DHS or CBP are allowed to bypass Congress by legislating through policy we might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether Judd concluded

									Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Saturday said the Senate would not hold a vote on any President Obama replacement for deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia but instead would wait until a new president takes office  setting the stage for a dramatic political showdown in Washington
The American peoplelrm should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice Therefore this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President McConnell said in a statement
With his previous two appointments Obama was replacing liberal justices with younger liberals
