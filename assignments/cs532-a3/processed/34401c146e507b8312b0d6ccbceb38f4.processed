concept of originalism certainly existed long before Scalia became its most familiar practitioner But Scalia played a pivotal intellectual role in refining the conceptnbspShortly before his Supreme Court nomination Scalia delivered a major address calling on originalists to relocate their fundamental inquiry Rather than searching for the original intent of constitutional Framers Scalia insisted originalists should search for the Constitutions original meaning for the publicAlthough Scalias reactionary jurisprudence has made him a polarizing figure Jeet Heer wrote last year the pungency of

think its pretty vague right now as to how he saidnbspMy reaction is its very unfortunate Its unfortunate with any death and politically in the presidential cycle were in my educated guess is nothing will happen before the next president is electedWith the Court currently divided 54 between Republican and generally conservative appointees and Democratic liberal appointees the death of Scalia
