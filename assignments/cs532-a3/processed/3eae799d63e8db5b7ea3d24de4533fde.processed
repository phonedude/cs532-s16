Newton became the first quarterback in NFL history with 35 TD passes and 10 rushing TDs in a single season Streeter LeckaGetty Images  The Panthers are the seventh team in NFL history to finish the regular season 151 or better and now theyre trying to become the first team since the 1985 Bears to lose only one game on the way to winning the Super Bowl So should Carolina be considered the best team of the past 30 years if it wins Super Bowl 50 With the Panthers regularseason success and playoff dominance here are reasons they belong in the conversation about the best teams in NFL history Coasting through the postseason The Panthers outscored Arizona and Seattle 557 in the first halves of their playoff games Their 34point win over the Cardinals on Jan 24 was the secondlargest margin of victory in NFC title game history The Giants beat the Vikings 410 after the 2000 season A blowout Super Bowl win for Carolina would cap one of the most dominant postseason runs in recent history The last team to win both the conference title game and the Super Bowl by double digits was the Steelers in the 2005 season Being led by the league MVP Cam Newton whos a lock to be named NFL MVP could become the 11th player all time to win the regularseason award and the Super Bowl in the same season and the first to accomplish the feat since Kurt Warner in 1999 Tom Brady Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers have won Super Bowls and NFL MVPs  but never both in the same season This year Newton became the first quarterback in NFL history with 35 TD passes and 10 rushing TDs in a single season Touting the top scoring offense The Panthers led the league in scoring racking up 500 points in the regular season 313 points a game Some of the top offenses in NFL history  the 2013 Broncos and 2007 Patriots  made it this far only to fall one win short of a title Only four NFL champs scored more points than the Panthers did this season  the 1994 49ers 1998 Broncos 1999 Rams and 2009 Saints In Tom Bradys four title years the Patriots never scored more than 468 regularseason points Forcing tons of turnovers The Panthers didnt come close to the plus43 turnover margin of the 1983 Redskins who lost to the Raiders in Super Bowl XVIII but they did lead the league at plus20  the same mark the Seahawks had a couple of years ago when they won it all At plus23 the 2000 Ravens were the last championship team to have a better turnover margin than the Panthers had this year Carolina had four players with at least four interceptions in the regular season  something no Super Bowl champion has had since the 1978 Steelers Read more from Express Super Bowl Fact or Fiction Quiz Super Bowl prediction Peyton Manning will ride off as a champion Ranking the potential Super Bowl matchups by
