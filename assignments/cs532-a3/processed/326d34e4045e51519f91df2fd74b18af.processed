        Clinton says Sanders proposed Iranian troops in Syria

                Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton debate in New Hampshire
              
            
          
             
                  
     
              
      
        
      

      
        In a heated debate ahead of the New Hampshire primary Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sharpened the contrasts between them Appearing on a stage at the University of New Hampshire in Durham Clinton targeted Sandersrsquo relative lack of national security experience

quotA group of national security experts issued a very concerning statement about Sen Sanders views on foreign policy and national security pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issuesquot Clinton said quotSuch as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try and resolve the conflict there Putting them right on the doorstep of Israelquot

Last month the Clinton campaign posted a critique of Sanders on precisely this point The campaign said Sanders quothas put forth proposals that indicate a lack of engagement and fundamental misunderstandings about the challenges before usquot

It cited Sandersrsquo own words We found them on his Senate website and in the transcript of a November 2015 Democratic debate

In September 2014 Sanders issued a news release It rejected any thought of sending American ground troops into Syria to fight ISIS That level of fighting in Syria he said should be left to the Muslim nations

quotThe war against ISIS a brutal and dangerous organization cannot be won unless the Muslim nations which are most threatened  Saudi Arabia Kuwait Qatar Turkey Iran and Jordan  become fully engaged including the use of ground troopsquot Sanders said quotThe US and the international community should be fully supportive but the leadership in this war must come from the Muslim worldquot

During the Democratic debate in Des Moines Iowa Nov 11 2015 Sanders echoed that point

quotHere39s something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region  Saudi Arabia Iran Turkey Jordan  all of these nations they39re going to have to get their hands dirty their boots on the ground They are going to have to take on ISISquot

Warren Gunnels policy adviser for the Sanders campaign told us Sanders was promoting the idea of a broad Muslim coalition

quotHe has never advocated specifically for Iranian troops in Syria but that there must be a coalition of nations with US troops providing supportquot Gunnels said quotHe certainly never advocated for Iranian troops on the Israeli borderquot

Itrsquos true that Sanders envisioned that the Iranian troops would be part of a much larger Muslim coalition that included Jordan and Turkey While both nations might have significant disagreements with Israel neither is an enemy of the Jewish state

Still we can take it that Sanders did promote the presence of Iranian troops in Syria Whether those troops themselves would be on the border with Israel is unknowable but Syria of course shares a border with Israel And Iran is no friend of Israel

Our ruling

Clinton said Sanders suggested that Iranian troops should fight on the ground in Syria Sanders did advance that idea on two occasions But Sandersrsquo comments were in the context of a multinational Muslim fighting force that included nations largely friendly toward Israel

The statement is accurate but lacks some useful details We rate it Mostly True
