Southwestern Kale Power Salad with Sweet Potato Quinoa 038 Avocado Sauce 
February 20 2015 118 Comments 
Dont you hate it when your brilliant ideas dont pan out Ive spent the week in the kitchen and I dont have much to show for it It8217s maddening I tell you But if anyone is going to end up with lackluster homemade meals let it be me I dont want any precious avocados or maple syrup going to waste in your kitchens on my behalf 

Ali and I were both in sour moods on Tuesday after spending the afternoon sharing pans and sighing at our resulting recipes We were so frustrated that we almost decided to stay in and watch more of The Blacklist on Netflix but We reminded each other that our evenings in Austin are dwindling I traded my yoga pants and sandals for skinny jeans and booties and we headed out
Dinner was pretty good I just ordered a salad Our waiter surprised me with a free dessert griddled cornbread and bourbon ice cream and the night got better from there



We found great live music I ordered more bourbon A stranger pulled me onto an empty dance floor and I for the first time in my life actually danced like no one was watching in a room full of people Correction I wiggled in front of a room full of people Im a terrible dancer but an excellent freeform wiggler 
Then we went downstairs to The Continental Club and watched an enchanting woman with wild gray hair belt out a few songs Luke Wilson was there We ran into our bartender friend Floyd and made a new friend too One of them brought me more bourbon The place filled up with members of the country music industry for an awards show afterparty and I witnessed a jawdropping number of fringed buttonups on men with very serious handlebar mustaches Best people watching ever Correction Best Tuesday Night Ever 

I digress After the disappointing recipes I decided to combine a few of my alltime favorite ingredients in a bowl and call it good Its great actually Here we have massaged kale quinoa spicy sweet potatoes and black beans served with a dollop of creamy avocado sauce feta and pepitas for good measure I8217d cook with only these ingredients if it weren8217t for diversity8217s sake Its a hearty healthy texturerich salad that packs great for lunch

			I levee any recipe that starts with 8220Southwestern8221 I dunno8230 could be my Texas roots or something   I always thought kale was a bitter green and thus had to be cooked to minimize that  How do you balance it8217s bitterness in it8217s raw state Is that where the other toppings play a role

			Hey Heather kale is on the bitter side My trick is to 8220massage8221 it with a dash of salt see step 4 Massaging it improves the texture makes it less poky and brings out the sweeter flavors Salt helps cut bitterness It gets really good if you let it marinate in dressing for 10 minutes or longer

			Definitely going to make this for lunch next week Also I made a kale salad from Sprouted Kitchen this week that called for toasting the pepitas in the pan with muscovado sugar I used coconut sugar and a pinch of salt and cayenne It only took a few extra minutes and really kicked the pepitas up to a whole other level I8217m pretty sure they would be AMAZING on this salad too given the flavors Can8217t wait to try it

			Why do all cooks say to devein Kale and throw it awy I devein and chop and add to steamed veggies or a chopped veggie salad I was taught to use all parts and not throw away You can chop and use or use to create veggie soup stock added with carrot stems outer onion skins etc

			Firstly Totally understand recipe fail frustration I am working on a project for a company at the moment and let8217s just say that those pumpkin muffins would have made better hockey pucks than edible snacks8230
Secondly that has to be one of the BEST Tuesday nights of ALL time What a great night out to shake off recipe testing blues
Thirdly Wow yes to these power bowls I can8217t wait to make some for my lunchbox And I have a massive sweet potato in the fridge just waiting for this to come along 
Enjoy the rest of your time in Austin

			Is this meant to be eaten warm room temp or cold It seems with such a short cooling time the sweet potatoes and quinoa would still be quite hot8230is that the intention Is mixing the warm quinoa with the kale meant to soften it up a bit

			Hi Nico I8217m sorry for my delay You can just skip the sauce or maybe use some sour cream in place of the avocado Not sure how that would turn out If you skip the sauce you might want to use this dressing instead of the basic limeolive oil marinade listed under the kale It has a more complex flavor

			I8217ve been following your website for awhile and last night made this bowlsalad I wasn8217t able to find any ripe avocados at the grocery store so I made it with a greek yogurt cilantro lime dressing first result if you type into google and oh my goodness it was so delicious My bf also loved it Also thank you for teaching me how to soften kale without the stove I made a different quinoa and kale bowl a few nights ago and cooked the kale way too much Massaging it with salt and topping with the lime and olive oil resulted in a much better texture and much fluffier salad Thank you

			This salad is unreal I8217ve made it at least 34 times in the past month The only thing I change is roasting the sweet potatoes and adding a little chili powder to them I8217ve used queso fresco and also omitted the cheese and it8217s still just as good without I love how well it holds up so I can make it to bring for lunches all week Makes a lot Even halved it usually gives me 34 lunch salads Love love love Favorite new recipe

			I made this for dinner tonight and it was absolutely DELICIOUS It was really flavorful filling and I can8217t wait to eat my leftovers for lunch tomorrow This will definitely be a repeat recipe Thank you
I8217m Vegan so I skipped the cheese and I skipped the coriander and added a clove of garlic to the avocado sauce because I like everything garlicky

			Just made this for lunch and it8217s absolutely delicious I could eat that avocado cream sauce out of the jar with a spoon Great flavor all around
The only thing I wanted more from it was more heat It had a little bit of a kick but next time I make it I8217d love to get more spicy Any ideas on how to add more heat without losing any of the amazing flavor

			Thanks Colleen I8217m obsessed with avocado sauce I8217d add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes or blend some into the avocado sauce You could also toss a chopped jalapeo into the kale mixture Peppers vary significantly with their heat levels so I8217d taste as you go

			HOLY BALLS this was delicious Integrating this recipeconcept into my cooking repertoire stat Spices are spot on in the sweet potatoes and the avocado sauce really ties the dish together I didn8217t have pepitas or quinoa on hand so I just used a wild rice blend which was still delicious I imagine this works with a variety of grains and greens and beans8211yay Thanks Kate

			I had already planned to make refried black beans today and was hungry for tacos so made parts of this recipe to put in my tacos8230sweet potatoes avocado dressing pepitas kale on top used cotija cheese because I had some Everything turned out great the whole family loved the meal which is rare I especially loved the sweet potatoes and am excited to eat the left overs tomorrow in breakfast burritos with eggs and to try the actual full salad recipe as well The sweet potatoes were so easy to make and awesome to eat I was trying to use up some sweet potatoes so ended up using about 23 lbs of sweet potatoes with the same amount of spices8230still delish and I thought the kids might like them better with a tad less spice This is my first Cookie  Kate recipe8230looking forward to trying out more

			I made this last night for a group of friends and everyone thought it was pretty tasty I enjoyed the avocado crema it turned out worth dirtying the food processor in order to make something emulsified with olive oil that acted as a dressing Though I would make quite a few changes if I were to make it again Not sure if I would repeat the recipe just because of the number of dishes it dirties in making it pot pan bowl and food processor for one dish Changes I would make8212
reduce the lime to 1 and either split it halfhalf with the avocado and kale or just add to the avocado the overall dish was too limey for me
use any extra leftover grains with the kale I used barley instead of quinoa otherwise don8217t bother with the extra step and dishes with the beans and sweet potato the salad already felt well rounded in terms of fiber and protein
double the spices on the sweet potato
