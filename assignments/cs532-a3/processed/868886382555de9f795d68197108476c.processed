                                                                        Two election cycles after losing the Democratic Party nomination because of her Iraq War vote Hillary Clinton finally seems to have put it behind her In fact with the latest wave of ISIS hysteria her hawkishness is seen by some as a plus At the same time striking a balance a good case can be made that though she did vote to authorize the Iraq War she would never have started it herself if she had been presidentJohn Kerry made that very same argument back in 2004 in fact As Kevin Drum described at the time the media was echoing the Bush campaign spin presenting Kerry8217s position as confused and ludicrous at best and as inconsistent flipflopping at worst But actually his position was a familiar one to themThey know very well that there are lots and lots of liberal hawks and other former war supporters who have exactly the same position pressuring Saddam was good inspections were good and eventually war might have been good too But Bush blew it he failed to rally world opinion he failed to get the Arab world on our side he failed to let the inspections process run its course and he failed to plan properly for the postwar occupation The result is alossof American power and prestige a diminished chance of Iraq becoming a pluralistic democracy and an alQaeda that8217s been given a second lease on life thanks to George Bush8217s Queeglike obsession with Saddam HusseinYou8217ll note that there8217s nothing new in the idea that invading Iraq benefited the Jihadi cause Liberal hawks may have been mistaken but not nearly as much as the neocons whose trap they fell into So has the liberal hawk position finally been fully vindicated Is Hillary Clinton finally in the right place at the right timeElectorally perhaps But in terms of actually having a working policy That8217s a whole different story After all Clinton herself pushed hard for a similarly flawed regime change strategy in LibyaConor Friedersdorf even compared her role in Libya to Cheney8217s in Iraq Hyperbolic Yes But he did have a point As summarized by Joel Gillin at the New Republic she did get carried away with questionable intelligence overfocused on deposing a longtime US bogeyman and failed to give sufficient consideration to the depths of difficulties that would follow afterwards All of which allowed the broader jihadi threat increased opportunity to spreadIn particular the key claim that something genocidal was about to unfold was entirely unfounded according to a lengthy review of the Libya intervention at the London Review of Books which noted that in retaking the towns that the uprising had briefly wrested from the governments control Gaddafis forces had committed no massacres at all the fighting had been bitter and bloody but there had been nothing remotely resembling the slaughter at Srebrenica let alone in Rwanda Given that Libya had normalized relations with the West in 20032004 renouncing its former international outlaw role including an active WMD program it was strikingly counterproductive to turn on Gaddafi like that if you want to coax other rogue states into the community of nationsSo more than a dozen years after the Iraq War votewhich she8217s finally semiapologized forthe vote itself is less important than the broader framework in which she cast it how she explained herself and how she8217s acted since What really matters about her decision back then is what it tells about how she8217d try to shape the future With Rand Paul all but disappearing from sight the GOP is now unified in its commitment to war war war They will fight fire with gasoline until the last oil well runs dry If there8217s going to be any learning from past mistakes any chance at all it8217s entirely up to the DemocratsSo what are the chances with Hillary Not very good I8217d argue But they can only improve by better understanding past mistakes So let8217s begin with her Iraq War vote and how she justified it at the time Here are the main problems that jump out from itClinton8217s mind was far removed from the terrorist threat that made the Iraq War even conceivable in the first place Her Senate speech videotext ran almost 2500 words but she never mentioned terrorism even once and mentioned terrorists just three timesHe Saddam Hussein has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al Qaeda members though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11 2001 Once the battle is joined however with the outcome certain he Saddam Hussein will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and to give what he can8217t use to terrorists who can torment us with them long after he is gone Secondly I want to insure that Saddam Hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the President8217s efforts to wage America8217s war against terrorists and weapons of mass destructionThe last quote simply echoes the neocon conflation of rationales It8217s not about actual terrorists at all The second quote is also primarily about WMDs the unidentified terrorists are an imagined afterthought The first quote therefore is the only realistically al Qaedarelated reference Clinton made in justifying going to waralbeit as a last resort She made no attempt whatsoever to talk about the larger context of responding to 911 She was essentially silent about what should have been the utmost concern This wasand remainsher most fundamental mistakeWhat should she have been thinking and speaking about Consider what Gen Anthony Zinni said just a few months before in advising strongly against the invasion of Iraq Zinni began by saying that military leaders see it one way while those who8217ve never been to war are gungho to go fight Then he said 8220You need to weigh this what are your priorities in the region That8217s the first issue in my mind8221 and he proceeded to tick off a listThe Middle East peace process in my mind has to be a higher priority Winning the war on terrorism has to be a higher priority More directly the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan Central Asia needs to be resolved making sure al Qaeda can8217t rise again from the ashes that are destroyed Taliban cannot come back That the warlords can8217t regain power over Kabul and Karzai and destroy everything that has happened so farThat8217s pretty much a list of most of the major things we8217ve ignored neglected or failed to follow through on If we8217d tackled Zinni8217s list of problems how much better off would the world be today Can we even imagine how different it would be But then he got really seriousOur relationships in the region are in major disrepair not to the point where we can8217t fix them but we need to quit making enemies we don8217t need to make enemies out of And we need to fix those relationships There8217s a deep chasm growing between that part of the world and our part of the world And it8217s strange about a month after 911 they were sympathetic and compassionate toward us How did it happen over the last year And we need to look at that 8212 that is a higher priorityI8217ll have more to say about this below but one has to ask how could a retired general be so aware of this problem while a senator like Clinton did not even consider it in the framework of her argument Finally there was one other area of concern Zinni highlighted before turning to the problems that invading Iraq would unleashThe country that started this Iran is about to turn around 180 degrees We ought to be focused on that The father of extremism the home of the ayatollah 8212 the young people are ready to throw out the mullahs and turn around become a secular society and throw off these ideas of extremism That is more important and critical They8217re the ones that funded Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations That ought to be a focus And I can give you many many more before you get down to Saddam and IraqThis part of Zinni8217s speech is particularly haunting since it represents the lone area in which we8217ve belatedly made some progress in dealing with the wide range of challenges he laid outand it8217s taken an incredibly fierce political fight to make that progress real It8217s also an area where Clinton has clearly done some longterm goodInstead of taking the broad multifaceted view of all the challenges we faced thatZinni laid out or alternatively focusing on fighting al Qaeda and the terrorist threat Clinton instead argued her case solely in terms of Iraq and the logic of how to proceed against Saddam Hussein8217s regime She first presented a factual account of USIraqi history thatvalidated questionable Bush administration claims and then she argued that her vote was a force for moderation and stabilitybuilding bipartisan support for Bush would show strength and thus save us from war Let8217s look more closely at how that wentI believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt Clinton said and devoted 411 words to summing up USIraq relations through 1998 when the UN inspectors left and the US and Britain responded with a fourday air assault Her account up to that point was relatively straightforward and not in doubt But then she said thisIn 1998 the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroadHowever President Bill Clinton8217s signing statement for the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act falls far short of a vigorous commitment to regime changeas the neocons pushing to oust Hussein were sharply aware From there Clinton8217s account became dramatically less free from doubtIn the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program He has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al Qaeda members though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11 2001 It is clear however that if left unchecked Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons Should he succeed in that endeavor he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East which as we know all too well affects American security Now this much is undisputedWe now know unequivocally that Iraq did not rebuild its WMD capacities as Clinton had claimed There were already ample reasons to doubt it at the time so she was clearly lying when she said this much is undisputed But she was also expressing a common elite consensus view And her stress on elite consensus was another troubling aspect of her speech for us to considerwhich we8217ll return to below First however we need to focus on Clinton8217s claim that Saddam had given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al Qaeda members

                Of course Saddam as secular dictator had no reason at all to behave as Clinton described He and bin Laden were bitter ideological enemies and the only thing that could bring them together was necessity and a common enemy they hated and feared more than each other That would be us And although both Saddam and bin Laden are dead their followers have joined together to fight us That is in fact the origin story of ISISor at least a crucial part of it as counterterrorism expert Malcolm Nance has explained talking to William Arkin for example They spoke a week after the death of former Saddam General Izzat Ibrahim alDouri and Nance saidWhat we didnt know until 2006 was that Saddam knew he would be defeated and used alDouri to organize an armed insurgency led by the Saddam Fedayeen to recreate the Great Arab Revolution of 1920 where the British were kicked out of southern Iraq after a multiyear insurgency AlDouri and the Revolutionary Command Council also had deep relations with Hafez alAssad and the Syrian Baath party At alDouris urging Saddam opened oil pipelines to Syria and built a cash relationship with the alAssad family In the runup to the US invasion in 2003 Saddam and alDouri Islamicised the coming insurgency allowing foreign terrorists into the country Syria became the pipeline for alQaeda foreign fighters and alAssad happily let them cross the border using his intelligence agencies to distribute weapons and facilitate travel One key group to arrive was that of Jordanianborn Abu Musab alZarqawi and his men of Tawhid walJihad Monotheism and Holy War They hated the Baathists but could not move freely through Iraq without their assistance A partnership was formed and they worked symbiotically Soon afterwards Zarqawis group became alQaeda in Iraq AQIAQI through various twists and turns eventually became ISIS The process by which ISIS emerged was long bloody and messy but what got it started and kept it going was the US invasion of Iraq starting as a threat and its consequences The marriage of the two forces was created by our own imagining of itand Hillary Clinton participated in that creation process along with everyone else in the bipartisan consensus she consciously invokedAfter her misleading presentation of the facts about Iraq combining real ones with Bushgenerated speculation Clinton went on to craft an equally misleading picture of the policy options and what a responsible bipartisan approach would look likeSome people favor attacking Saddam Hussein now with any allies we can muster she first said However this course is fraught with danger8230 If we were to attack Iraq now alone or with few allies it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us she argued citing the possibilities of Russia invading Georgia to attack Chechen rebels India launching a preemptive strike on Pakistan or China implicitly doing the same vs Taiwan All of which led her to conclude that for all its appeal a unilateral attack while it cannot be ruled out on the present facts is not a good optionShe then turned to the other extreme position as it were Others argue that we should work through the United Nations and should only resort to force if and when the United Nations Security Council approves it which is of course what international law says that we have to do But we8217re the cops of the world as Phil Ochs put it so the laws don8217t apply to us And so Clinton argued in her balanced bipartisan wayBut there are problems with this approach as well The United Nations is an organization that is still growing and maturing It often lacks the cohesion to enforce its own mandates And when Security Council members use the veto on occasion for reasons of narrowminded interests it cannot actEven worse she addedIn the case of Iraq recent comments indicate that one or two Security Council members might never approve force against Saddam Hussein until he has actually used chemical biological or God forbid nuclear weaponsMeaning that Russia or China might actually stand up for respecting the UN Charter rather than letting us use it as a fig leaf for attacking Iraq first Note too Clinton8217s cute little Condi Rice impersonationShe then outdid herself in recasting the nature of the vote she was about to castThe question is how do we do our best to both defuse the real threat that Saddam Hussein poses to his people to the region including Israel to the United States to the world and at the same time work to maximize our international support and strengthen the United NationsAgain we see Clinton running together distinctly different things Saddam8217s very real but hardly unique threat to his own people with a vagueatbest threat to the region including Israel and a nonexistent threat to the United States to the world How any of these are supposed to be related to 911 and the threat of international terrorism does not even come close to making it onto Clinton8217s radaralthough she does claim to want to maximize our international support and strengthen the United Nations both of which would certainly be much more likely if we8217d stuck to focusing on al Qaeda and fighting terrorism rather than settling old scores
                            
                                
                            But Clinton as much as Bush was still too fixated on Iraq to even begin thinking clearly about that even a full 13 months after 911 And so she concluded I believe the best course is to go to the UN for a strong resolution that scraps the 1998 restrictions on inspections and calls for complete unlimited inspections with cooperation expected and demanded from Iraq She was not completely satisfied with how Bush was proceeding but hey close enough for bipartisanship rightPresident Bush8217s speech in Cincinnati and the changes in policy that have come forth since the Administration began broaching this issue some weeks ago have made my vote easier Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first and placing highest priority on a simple clear requirement for unlimited inspections I will take the President at his word that he will try hard to pass a UN resolution and will seek to avoid war if at all possibleClinton apparently thought Bush8217s Cincinnati speech was just great A critical reading by experts leaves a very different impression Consider Bush8217s wildeyed fearmongering claim that Iraq might threaten the US with drones unmanned armed vehiclesUAVsWe are concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using UAVs for missions targeting the United StatesIn response to which author Rahul Mahajansaid The claim that these UAVs have ranges that would enable attacking the United States and that they could reach it undetected is a startlingly new one and entirely untenable No one has ever produced evidence of Iraqi capability or intent to target the United States directly Not only should the drone claim been seen as a wildeyed threat exaggeration at best it should have cast all other publicly unsupported threat claims into very serious doubt as wellMahajan and other experts critical of Bush had a much better read of what he was up to than Clinton did and comparing their critical analysis to her uncritical acceptance shows just how much her elite bipartisan insiderism blinded her to what was actually going on Note in particular this part of Bush8217s speech and Mahajan8217s critical commentBush Some citizens wonder After 11 years of living with this problem why do we need to confront it now There is a reason We have experienced the horror of September 11 We have seen that those who hate America are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people Our enemies would be no less willing  in fact they would be eager  to use a biological or chemical or a nuclear weapon Mahajan Invoking September 11 without showing any kind of link between the government of Iraq and those attacks is just transparent manipulation What he really means is that after September 11 he thinks he can get away with such a policyClinton went along with this nonsense accepting its lack of logic as a form of logic because it was what elite insiders were doing at the time As with Kerry there8217s no reason to think she would have pulled the trigger on going to war without WMDs being foundand yet as the case of Libya cited above reminds us she remains very willing to use force based on questionable intelligence without fulling thinking through the alternatives the longterm consequences or the other problems facing us which ought to rank a good deal higher in our list of concernsMake no mistake there8217s no one in the GOP who wouldn8217t eagerly make things much much worse when it comes to pursuing a war against terrorism But that8217s a truly terrible yardstick for us to be using Terrorists want war War creates more terrorists That8217s what the Iraq War clearly demonstrated We need to think about going beyond that finding a different way In his conversation with William Arkin Malcolm Nance proposed a multifaceted approach to combating ISIS with different strategies in different theaters of struggle but first and foremost he called for taking on their ideologyLaunch an integrated global counterideology war against ISISAlQaeda I call it Counter Ideology Operations and Warfare CIDOW We need to confront the belief system head on The global jihad movement ideology is a destructive religious cult It is so unIslamic that it is virtually antiIslamic Soon enough ISIS will do something that enrages the entire Muslim world and it will force them to act Burning the Jordanian pilot came close but we shall see what lifts the veil from their eyesThe last 14 years have seen America completely lose track of what its own core ideological strengths are If they hate us for our freedoms then fine we8217ll get rid of them That8217s been our response in a nutshell We8217ve been taken so far out of touch with our own values that it might seem like a pipe dream to turn the tables on ISIS and exploit their contradictions But that8217s exactly what we need to do And nothing in Hillary Clinton8217s record shows any capacity for engaging ISIS on those termsTo the contrary Clinton8217s just like Bush and the neocons in fighting the last century8217s wars She8217s much smarter about it in theory at least But we8217re in a whole different ballgame now and none of our foreign policy elites seem to have a clue about that despite a growing chorus of experts trying to point to a different way
