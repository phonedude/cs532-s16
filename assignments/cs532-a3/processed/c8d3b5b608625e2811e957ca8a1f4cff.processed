I am unsure if nachos or chicken wings are the most served appetizers for the Super Bowl or really any big game no matter the sport Did you see this TheNational Chicken Councilestimates 13 billion chicken wings will be consumed this weekendwith todaybeing the second biggest eating day of the year Myfamily especially the boys absolutely love and request nachos These 6 winning Super Bowl nacho recipes are very diverse including grilled steak rotisserie chicken Greek Style and even Mexican street corn Enjoy for the Super Bowl tonight or for March Madness your favorite baseball game or even the Masters Enjoy your Super Bowl Sunday and have a great week
