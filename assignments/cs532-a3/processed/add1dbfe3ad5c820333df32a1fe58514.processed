Nestcam is a view of a specially adapted Barn Owl Trust nestbox in a barn in Cornwall UK
If you8217re patient you should be able to see adult Barn Owls coming and going and eventually watch the young owls fledging You can also watch Barncam 
The cameras and the images are kindly provided to the Trust free of charge by Wlidlife TV
Wild Barn Owls have been nesting at this site since 1994 and most years they have been successful However please be aware that they are in the wild at a remote location and we8217re not in control of what happens to them It is natural for some of the eggs to fail and some of the nestlings to die and we cannot be held responsible for this
Survival and nesting success are largely controlled by food supply and encouraging the creation of preyrich habitat is one of the most important things that the Barn Owl Trust does Hopefully the owls will do really well this year and you8217ll really enjoy watching them
Practical conservation measures like habitat advice and nestbox erection are only two of the many things the Barn Owl Trust does and details can be found on our website
