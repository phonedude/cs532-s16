        Bernie Sanders mistaken about whether his campaigns ad had cited a nonexistent endorsement

                This is a screenshot of a portion of a Bernie Sanders ad that says the Valley News endorsed him
              
            
          
             
                  
     
              
      
        
      

      
        MSNBCrsquos Rachel Maddow pressed Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders about a few controversies surrounding his staff during the Feb 4 2016 New Hampshire presidential debate

One that had emerged in the previous 24 hours concerned an ad Sandersrsquo campaign had run in advance of the New Hampshire primary

Maddow asked Sanders about the Nashua Telegraph complaining recently quotthat you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did notquot

Sanders responded quotWe did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates and to the best of my knowledge that is what we did So we never said never said that somebody a newspaper endorsed us that did not What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaperquot

Maddow then said quotJust to follow up on that the title of the ad in question was lsquoEndorsementrsquo quot

Sanders responded quotBut that was only for  that was not to be on television That39s an important point That was just something  as the secretary knows you put titles on ads and you send them out but there was no word in that ad none that said that those newspapers had endorsed usquot

As it happens Maddow had referred specifically to one of two newspapers cited in the ad and her choice might have allowed Sanders an out  the ad in question did not explicitly say the Telegraph had endorsed him

But in his answer Sanders broadened his response to include quotthose newspapersquot which is a problem because the initial version of the ad did explicitly includenbsptext that said the Valley News had endorsed him when it had not This version was later tweaked for subsequent use

The ad was first posted online Wednesday Feb 3 and touts endorsements from unions an environmental group and The Nation magazine

quotFrom postal workers to nurses hersquos been endorsed for real changequot a narrator says in the ad

The narrator goes on to quote editorials from two New Hampshire newspapers The Telegraph of Nashua and the Valley News which covers both Vermont and New Hampshire from West Lebanon NH

Up to that point in the 30second ad every logo for an organization or publication has been accompanied by the words quotendorsed byquot Those words disappear when the Telegraphrsquos logo appears along with the quote quotHersquos not beholden to Wall Street Moneyquot

The words quotendorsed byquot then reappear next to the logo of the Valley News which appears along with the quote quotSanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary Americans for as long as we can rememberquot

Neither the Valley News nbspnor the Telegraph endorsed Sanders

Telegraph executive editor Roger Carroll posted on Twitter the afternoon of Feb 3 quotFor the record despite BernieSanders deceptive ad to the contraryNashuaTelegraph has not endorsed any Dem prez candidate nhpoliticsquot

More problematic for Sandersrsquo claim in the debate nbspis how the original ad handled the Valley News

Valley News editor Martin Frank said Feb 4 that his newspaper had likewise not endorsed a Democrat in the primary PolitiFact New Hampshire reported

As news of the spotrsquos issues spread the Sanders campaign ended up revising the ad It removed the word quotendorsedquot by the Valley News logo although it left the quotes from both New Hampshire newspapers untouched Thatrsquos the version of the ad that was on the campaignrsquos official YouTube channel immediately before the debate and the ad is still titled quotEndorsedquot

After the debate Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels told PolitiFact that thenbspincorrect version of the adnbspnever aired onnbsptelevision

quotAnbspYouTube version of this ad mistakenly used this word but it was never aired on television As soon as we discovered this mistake it was taken downquot Gunnels said

However during the debate Sanders didn39t draw a distinction between the campaign buying air time on TV and posting a publicly viewable ad on the Internetnbsp

The Valley News editorial quoted in the ad ndash from Dec 31 2014 nbspencouraged Sanders to enter the presidential race quotA presidential candidate who vigorously espoused populism from a progressive point of view could help restore muchneeded balance to American political life which has tilted sharply to the right in recent decadesquot the paper wrote

However it was published far too early in the campaign cycle to be considered an endorsement

Our ruling

In the debate Sanders said one of his campaign ads quotnever said  a newspaper endorsed us that did notquot

Sanders is glossing over the initial version of his campaign ad It originally includednbsptext that said Sanders had been quotendorsedquot by the Valley News a word that was later removed after it became clear that the newspaper had made no such endorsement

We rate Sandersrsquo claim in the debate False
