							Going into the AFC Championship the reasoning here was that because Peyton Manning lacked mobility and has displayed a rag arm at times this season the Patriots defense would be able to load up to stop the run jump the short pass routes and dictate where Manning could and couldnt throw
Thats not what happened The Broncos were able to run the ball a lot 30 times if not all that far 99 yards That threat allowed Manning to throw on his schedule and even if the passes werent pretty two of them still ended up in Owen Daniels hands in the end zone and 20 points went up on the board enough to win by two
The real takeaway though from BroncosPatriots was the Denver defense the incessant pounding Tom Brady took by the way that guy is still incredible leading that last touchdown drive basically looking through his ear hole on almost every play It was also a sight to behold the hits the Denver secondary put on Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman at times sending those small Patriots receivers three or four yards in the air after contact
Speaking of takeaways they are the lifeblood of this Carolina team They were plus20 in turnover ratio in the regular season and that thievery has carried over to the playoffs where they are plus8 in two games Luke Kuechlys picksix against Russell Wilson made it 140 before many fans had even reached their seats in the divisional round helping the Panthers cruise to a 310 halftime lead before holding on for dear life 3124 Then in the NFC Championship Carolinas defense tortured Carson Palmer with four interceptions and two forced fumbles creating seven turnovers in all counting Patrick Petersons fumbled punt
That 4915 result the Panthers hit the Over all by themselves is what created a spread for the Super Bowl thats almost double what it should be Last week Jay Kornegay the vice president of race and sports operations at the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook explained in The Post that if the results of the title games were disregarded the Panthers would be threepoint favorites over the Broncos on a neutral field
He said the public including people who make the Super Bowl their only bet of the year would jump on the Panthers because of their NFC title domination and at the end the savvy bettors the sharps would come in and take the Broncos with the extra spread value Thats exactly whats happened with the line which went from 3 all the way to six before coming back to 5
Two years ago the Broncos made a mess of the New YorkNew Jersey Super Bowl They fell behind the Seahawks 20 on the first snap 220 by the half and 340 before they scored their first point
Even a bad experience counts as experience though and the veterans of that game certainly are cognizant of the need to start strong and not get blown out of the building early by the Panthers
Manning against the Carolina ballhawking defense will be interesting but the real show will be Cam Newton against the edgerushing hardhitting Denver D Its been mostly a joyride for Newton thus far but there have been a couple of moments of pause In the Giants game in December he limped off once and was clutching his shoulder on another occasion He will put himself in positions to take some big shots and if one of them causes real damage the Cats are cooked
This could matter too Manning has brother Eli in his ear telling him how he threwfour touchdown passes and put up 35 points on Carolina
And finally there are these facts Eight of the last 14 Super Bowls have been decided by four points or fewer and the underdog covered in six of the previous seven Super Bowls before last years which was a pick em game and had no favoriteunderdog
The picks Broncos 5 and Under 44
