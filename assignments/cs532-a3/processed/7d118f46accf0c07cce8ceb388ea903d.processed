        Bernie Sanders says he polls better against GOP candidates than Hillary Clinton

                Bernie Sanders says that if he does well in Iowa and New Hampshire We are looking at one of the great political upsets in the modern history of the United States of America
              
            
          
             
                  
     
              
      
        
      

      
        In the runup to the Iowa caucus Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders has repeatedly said he has a better chance of beating the eventual Republican nominee in the Nov 8 general election than fellow Democratic rival Hillary Clinton

quotAlmost all of the polls that  and polls are polls they go up they go down  but almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clintonquot he told voters during a Jan 19 town hall meeting in Underwood Iowa

We took a look at the various national surveys as compiled by RealClearPolitics and PollingReportcom to see how that assertion stacks up against the data

The only recent national poll to look at the question at the time Sanders made his comment was completed Jan 13 for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee it found Sanders beats Trump by 15 percentage points compared to a 10point win for Clinton

That certainly supports Sanders39 claim but that poll didn39t compare him to any other GOP candidates

To find another poll to properly compare Clinton39s and Sanders39 relative strengths you have to go back to a Quinnipiac Poll completed Dec 20 There Sanders beats Trump by 13 points while Clinton defeats him by 7 points

However in a matchup against Republican Marco Rubio Sanders loses by three points and Clinton wins by just a single point Against Ted Cruz Sanders loses by a point and Clinton ties Cruz at 44 percent each So Clinton is performing slightly better but these results are largely within the margin of error of  29 points

A third poll taken during the same timeframe as Quinnipiac by Public Policy Polling found that Sanders would lose to Trump by two points Rubio by three points Cruz by one point and Jeb Bush by one point

Clinton in contrast would beat Bush by five points Trump by three points and Cruz two points but lose to Rubio by one point Both Democrats would tie with Republican Ben Carson The margin of error was  28 percentage points

So the Public Policy Pollingnbspsurvey doesn39t support Sanders either You can see a chart of the varying matchups and point differences at the end of this factcheck

When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim they submitted a consultant39s memo from Jan 8 2016 that focuses on the Quinnipiac study and two other polls a CNNORC International Poll from Dec 1721 and an EconomistYouGov poll from Dec 1821

Neither the CNNORC survey nor the EconomistYouGov poll test Sanders in a general election against a Republican

Instead the memo argues that Sanders if nominated is more likely to win in November because he polls better than Clinton among independent voters he39s quotviewed more favorably than any other presidential candidate of either partyquot and Clinton39s support is slipping against the Republicans

For the record the EconomistYouGov poll found that Clinton39s favorability score was just as high as Sanders with both at 44 percent Of the 2000 respondents 39 percent were not registered to vote

Whether high favorability ratings directly translate into votes in a general election is an open question

Our ruling

Sanders said quotAlmost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clintonquot

The NBC NewsWall Street Journal national poll released before Sanders39 statement supports his claim for Trump but it has no data against Cruz or Rubio Earlier polls say he doesn39t outperform Clinton at all against Cruz Rubio or Bush and the narrow races combined with the margins of error make his contention even more dubious

Beating Clinton in only two of eight hypothetical matchups is far from quotalmost allquot

The statement is not accurate so we rate it False
