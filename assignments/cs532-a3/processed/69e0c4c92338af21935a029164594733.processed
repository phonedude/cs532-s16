Fried Pickles with Dill Greek Yogurt Sauce





This shop has been compensated by Collective Bias Inc and its advertiser All opinions are mine alone    BackYourSnack CollectiveBias














On my summer tomake list all summer long has been a dill Greek yogurt sauce It sounded so good and with the addition of fresh dill I knew it would be full of flavor I took a shortcut with this recipe by using Farm Rich crispy dill pickles to save time Farm Rich has a new contest going on called the Back Your Snack contest which you can learn more about below


I wanted a sauce that tasted rich but was actually quite healthy I love using Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because it tastes the same but has no fat is lower in calories and is higher in protein and calcium It tastes decadent but is actually not 

This sauce is loaded with flavor with the addition of the dill fresh green onions and garlic It is delicious and could also be used as a vegetable dip or eaten with a wholewheat pita Other uses for this sauce would be on a wrap or with Mediterranean foods 




I made this recipe for my husbands side of the family about 30 people and they really liked it Many of them had not tried fried dill pickles before and they were impressed They asked the brand and plan to purchase some themselves The sauce was perfect and was good with the dill pickles and with baked wholewheat pita slices

For this recipe I used Farm Rich crispy dill pickles which I picked up at my local Walmart I also purchased some Walmart Fresh items such as the cucumber green onions and garlic cloves My family has been using Farm Rich products for years for quick appetizers I like to make semihomemade appetizers by using a Farm Rich app and adding my own unique sauce or side to accompany it
