		Are some charters practices new forms of colonialhegemonyWhen examining current discipline policies and aligned behavioral norms within charter school spaces postcolonial theory is useful because of the striking similarities between problematic socialization practices and the educational regimes of the uncivilized masses in colonized nations A number of postcolonial theorists focus on multiple ways that oppressors dominate their subjects and maintain power over them For example while working as the Dean of Students for a charter school in New Orleans it took me some time to realize that I had been enforcing rules and policies that stymied creativity culture and student voice Though some of my main duties involved ensuring the safety and security of all students and adults at the school investigating student behavioral incidents and establishing a calm and positive school culture I felt as if I was doing the opposite
My daily routine consisted of running around chasing young Black ladies to see if their nails were polished or if they added a different color streak to their hair or following young men to make sure that their hair wasnt styled naturally as students were not able to wear their hair in uncombed afro styles None of which had anything to do with teaching and learning but administration was keen on making sure that before Black students entered the classroom that they looked appropriate for learning As if students whose hair was natural or those whose parents could not afford a uniform tie could not achieve like others who possessed these items
Most times teachers and administrators scolded Black students for their appearance before they even spoke in morning If a student did not have the right shoes they would be placed in a holding area until their parent could be reached Sometimes if their parent could not be reached those students remained in that area the entire day and given detention I have absolutely no problem with enforcing school rules or policies but when schools penalize and prevent Black students from learning and engaging in the classroom because their parents do not have the resources or simply cannot afford the uniforms I take issue with that and I voiced my displeasure many times
Each day I could have up to 10 students in my office affectionately dubbed the TOC time out center by the end of the first period Students continued to come throughout the day as teachers would simply not allow students to come back to their classroom Most of the teachers guilty of this behavior were TFA Teach for America cohort members who were great hearted individuals but could not control their classrooms Most had no sense of cultural competence and frankly felt as if they did not need to know the kids to teach them When a few teachers attempted to develop relationships with Black students and parents it seemed disingenuous and painful Many times they avoided parent phone calls and conferences because they felt like a confrontation would occur Students would enter my office daily and say she put me out for nothing I just got up to sharpen my pencil and she said go to Mr Griffin that lady dont like me Teachers regularly abused the mark system we implemented at the school as well
Students could be sent to my office after receiving 3 marks but some teachers would focus on certain kids and as soon as they made a sound they would give them a mark If I had twenty students sent to me by lunch time I would have to take those students to lunch duty with me take them back upstairs afterwards and help teachers manage their classrooms at the same time Each day I would average 2535 students in detention without any followup from teachers Detention became a dumping ground especially for students exhibiting disabilities ADHD ED etc
Most Black students with or exhibiting disabilities were pegged as outliers at the beginning of each school year they were unfairly targeted by some teachers who had deficit attitudes sometimes before even meeting the students Many times these students were placed on a special plan where their parents had to pick them up early and work would be sent home with them to make it seem like they were learning something However the work was never turned in or even requested from teachers If they were not sent home early they were given detention If their behavior was perceived as disruptive in detention they were given some form of suspension 98 of the students were Black but if you happened to be a male and exhibited some form of disability chances are that you were treated harsher suspended numerous times and spent several hours a day outside of the learning environment Many were even sent home for the year after taking the LEAP Louisiana Educational Assessment Program standardized tests and treated like throwaways
When we tried to implement response to intervention RTI with students who either possessed or exhibited disabilities they were immediately moved from tier 1 to tier 3 and some were subsequently placed in special education even though this did not fit the needs of the student The idea to segregate certain students considered outliers was due to administrative convenience and because most teachers perceived them as being unruly troubled or just plain too academically deficient to be in class with the other students This allowed teachers to not be held accountable for teaching all kids and prevented Black students from receiving valuable instruction time
Lastly everything at the school was done in a militaristicprison fashion Students had to walk in lines everywhere they went including to class and the cafeteria The behavioral norms and expectations called for all students to stand in unison with their hands to their sides facing forward silent until given further instruction The seemingly tightly coupled structure proved to be inefficient as students and teachers constantly bucked the system in search of breathing room The systems and procedures seemingly did not care about the Black children and families they served They were suffocating and meant to socialize students to think and act a certain way In the beginning we were teaching structure but it evolved to resemble postcolonialism Vasquez Heilig Khalifa and Tillman 2013 stated that education was and still is used as a hegemonic form to monitor sanction and control civilized people Thus postcolonial theory Fanon 1952 1961 Memmi 1965 Said 1978 offers a critical framework through which urban educational policies and practices can be understood and critiqued DeLeon 2012 Shahjahan 2011They continue their analysis by stating that at base postcolonial theorists interrogate the relationship between the legitimized conquering power and the vanquished subaltern and ask questions about who defines subjectivities such as knowledge resistance space voice or even thought Fanon 1961  argued Colonialism wants everything to come from it Essentially colonizers delegitimize the knowledge experience and cultures of the colonized and establish policy and practice that will always confirm the colonial status quo In other words it is important to note that postcolonial studies though often thought of as relegated to a particular period are actually also a reference to thoughts practices policies and laws that impact marginalized Black bodies enrolled in charters during the current educational policy era

					Hello  I had to stop reading at the ADHD paragraph part  The way the New Orleans charters schools are treating these kids is disgusting to me  I8217m a product of the public school system so I guess I can8217t relate to what these kids are going through
Privatized charter schools are going to ruin this country if they8217re being ran like this  And Black students will have nothing to show for it  Shame of a Nation

More insight and examples of the TFA and chart school mentality that will be coming to a public school near you if we don8217t put a stop to it
Can you share which charter schools you worked for in NOLA

					Does the photo reflect the kind of situation that you found in the school though  I find that implied link offensive The adolescents at the school have SCHOOL with adults who are there to help  Do we know that about the children in the photo who came before them

					I take pamela carroll8217s comment to mean that the photo posted is not of today8217s students in the school but comes from an earlier era when white eyes saw black people as picturesque as 8216natives8217 as 8216uncivilized8217
I take the point to be  8220This is how we STILL view Black kids even in a modern charter school  It isn8217t working   Don8217t do it8221

					Powerful stuff On the one hand I agree that in order to teach and provide an adequate learning environment there must be some form of discipline There also must be a considerable measure of order and rules that guide the school8217s daytoday operations However when rules become unrelated or 8220tit for tat8221 then it creates a micromanaged society that entices the rules to be broken I believe that students can and will adhere to discipline when it is reasonable and has a clear goal that is evident
In response to the entire notion of recolonization I 100 agree The environment which you describes seems to be one that doesn8217t allow free thinkers or opportunity for expression That is where the problems arise for me Enslaving the minds of our future isn8217t healthy it creates a situation where they can no longer see the forest for the trees 
Great post

					My experience as a teacher 40 plus years now began in New Orleans and I remained there working either directly for the Orleans Public schools or with them for thirty years as a teacher Upward Bound coordinator advocate for student leadership programs in all NO high schools as an ESR coordinator for a schoolwide conflict resolution program as a researcher in the completion of my doctorate a PhD in educational leadership at UNO The  descriptions by Griff19 above rings true In my opinion based on 30 years of observation the colonizers will always lean toward the status quo 8211 charters or no charters vouchers or no vouchers or a public school system in contrast of a private and parochial school system as still exists in NO  New Orleans in many ways operates like a third world 8211 banana republic many who live there believe  It8217s no accident I think that the Greek Revival home that the President of Tulane University enjoys on St Charles Ave was donated by the a powerful family from the United Fruit Company the ultimate Banana Republic Corporation 
In New Orleans the colonial process is very complex and reaches high social and political places Former NO mayor and Urban League President Marc Morial recently came out for endorsed CCSS yet he like many from his class in NO never attended public school  His elitist view born of privileges quite different than the students described in this article sees education as Sec Duncan sees it I believe Creoles in NO have experienced discrimination in NO to be sure especially since Jim Crow Mr Plessy a Creole who could pass as white was really trying to establish the old order of privilege for Creoles 8220Free People of Color8221 better educated than most whites when he and his cohorts took their famous case to the Supreme Court out of New Orleans in the late 1800s  They lost and it wasn8217t until 1954 with Brown v Board of Education that legal desegregation rights were returned to them and former slaves alike  
A former colleague of mine and a person with deep roots in the NO Creole 8220Free People of Color8221 community distinguished herself as a Principal by turning an inner city NO school completely around and winning national recognition  She went on to Harvard in their esteemed Urban Superintendents Program and earned a Harvard doctorate and high positions in urban education districts New Orleans Memphis Newark NJ and Atlanta  Her leadership forte was Curriculum Development and she won her districts high marks for innovation and continuous improvement with NCLB testing  
Bill Gates and other eindustrialists and politicians associated with the so called 8220educational reforms8221 and testing moments in education supported her and I believe in typical colonial fashion Then came a manufactured testing scandal that served the interests of other racist and conservative politicians the two most current governors of GA as I see it found a popular political agenda to advance their own agenda In the end my former colleague was thrown under the bus by Gates and his ilk just as Plessy was thrown to the back of the bus  This 8220colonialism8221 isn8217t just with students as shown above but for those like Julian who attend institutions like Harvard and Stanford too  Colonialism mentality reaches the highest institutions like Harvard and Stanford and into the Corporate Board Rooms too  They will act as if the children being colonized as depicted above the poor and black and brown and male are of concern to them  Only half believe it and be wary

					OMG8230I8217ve been deconstructing this notion for years From my experience at a Godforsaken charter school as an Intervention Specialist Special Needs teacher being told by the 8220superintendentowner8221 who was granted the school by the state of Ohio but later retracted when complaints were filed due to him being a convicted felon8230a police officer selling drugs out of his cruiser that my salary was contingent upon how many students I labeled special needs to my recent Graduate Assistantship position in an urban charter school in Ohio My cohort member and I were discussing how these schools are the new plantations and perpetuate forms of neosegregation GREAT read

					I have more thoughts on this issue than I can fit into a comment but I8217ll try to be brief Note that this is coming from a TFA who grew up in New Orleans taught in a charter school in NO taught at a traditional public school in St Bernard Parish and went to the 1 or 2 white public schools from K12
1 Classroom discipline is the most difficult skill to learn for a new teacher I believe that some of these militaristic policies are a shortcut for new teachersespecially those that dont understand the community While teaching at the KIPP charter school I realized that it was helpful yet impersonal in my first year More veteran teachers did not have to be as rigid
2 What he describes as prisonlikemilitaristic ie lines structure etc is appropriate for elementary school but dehumanizing beyond that Jean Gordon Elementary had lines fingers on lips heads on desks etc Lusher Extension middle and Franklin High didntbecause it wasn8217t age appropriate
3 Uniformsdress codeappearance I never wore a uniform from K12 I learned just fine and dress more appropriately and professionally than the majority of my professional counterparts Before teaching at a majority white working class conventional public school not charter I saw dress codes as radicalized White public schools didnt have them the black ones did And talk to any older Franklin graduate from the early and mid 90s Many of them attest to the positive correlation between increase in black student percentage and increase in dress code strictness In fact as McMain and I think Karr as well went from a mixed school to a black one uniforms were instituted 
Fast forward to my teaching of working class white kids in St Bernard Parish They wore uniforms most hairstyles were banned even long hair for boys boys couldn8217t even grow out their natural facial hair do you know how cool the 34 8th graders with facial hair are in other schools Even their freaking socks had to be white This has NO relationship with education so charter schools that serve black kids are not the only culprits Maybe its a socioeconomic class thing
Dress codes have some valuein the 90s kids were being murdered for Jordans amp Starter jackets but its not the 90s anymore it saves the poorest of kids from being teased hoop earrings for girls are dangerous if the school has a lot of fights short skirts amp shorts for girls can distract other students but isnt a deal breaker sagging pants and guys w earrings can be argued as not appropriate for a professional setting I agree with Melissa that learning to follow rigid rules helps you in adulthood What I dont understand is why the rules are noticeably less rigid in middle class white school Perhaps in the real world poor kids generally have to work rigid hourly jobs with time cards and strict management while middle class people have less rigid salaried careers
4 Special Ed I taught Special Ed at a working class school that was 70 white My SpEd classes were 50 black male That is a HUGE problem HUGE
