        Billionaire businessman calls President Obama totally incompetent
    
        
        
    
    Donald Trump got boos Saturday night during the GOP primary presidential debate when he told fellow candidate Jeb Bush to be quiet and then said those in the crowd who did not like his comments were quotdonors and special interestsrdquo
Trump was also hard on President Barack Obama and the state of the countrynbsp
Obama quotis totally incompetentquot and quotour country is going to hellquot said Trumpnbsp
When asked about torture tactics he said quotI would bring back waterboarding and I39d bring back a hell of a lot of worse than waterboardingquot
The debate aired on ABC was held at St Anselm College in Manchester NH and moderated by David Muir and Martha Raddatznbsp
Toward the end of the debate all of the candidates were asked who would win Super Bowl 50 Trump picked the Carolina Panthersnbsp
Trump is coming off a secondplace finish in the Iowa primary and he took one last dig at Ted Cruz during his closing statement mentioning the controversy that happened during the primary saying that Cruz got quotsome of Ben Carson39s votesquotnbsp
The debate got off to an disjointed start when the order of candidates coming to the stage was different from their announcements Carson who stood awkwardlynbspwhile waiting for his turn called out the error as soon as he was addressed by the moderatorsnbsp
The New Hampshire primary will be held on Tuesdaynbsp
