Dallas Carter alumni Michael Crabtree saves DFWs statistical bacon in this math matchup
Wikicommons
 
 Dallas and Houston have never officially met in the Super Bowl but that doesnrsquot mean we canrsquot find a good way to pit them against each other ahead of Sunday nightrsquos Super Bowl 50 bonanza Both metro areas fancy themselves as the statersquos No 1 football hotbed but which really comes out on top when it comes to producing the most primetime performersnbsp 
For an answer I scoured the record books of each of the previous 49 Super Bowls for most DFW and Houston metro natives to have ever done something in a Super Bowl on the offensive or special teams side of the ball Then I took all those native sonsrsquo statistics and put them up against each other Here the criterion for ldquonative sonrdquo is solely based on the metro area where the Super Bowler played high school football Data sources include official NFL records The Ultimate Super Bowl Book and the invaluable databasefootballcom and wwwprofootballreferencecom I went through each Super Bowl roster and gathered biographical information such as the playersrsquo high schools along with their statistics From there it was a matter of some serious filtering to get the DallasFort Worth metroplex and Greater Houston playersI didnrsquot gather defensive stats primarily because many tackle and sack statistics were not considered official in previous decades They were not as well kept as the offensive and special teams statistics Where helpful there are links below to full data sets soireacutees and notes posted on blogs I runnbspIn terms of prep football prowess DFW sure wears some mighty high boots but it isnrsquot stepping as high as Houston DFW high school alumni have totaled only 348 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in all previous Super Bowls compared to 498 rushing yards and five rushing TDs by Houston It gets worse in receiving yards There Houstonians have accumulated 843 yards and 11 touchdowns compared to 285 and 3 TDs by DFWers And it would be a lot worse without Dallas Carter alum Michael Crabtreersquos 109 yards for San Francisco in Super Bowl XLVII

Evin Demirel 
Things get even worse in quarterbacking DFW alumni have had such a difficult time getting into the Super Bowl its downright Romoesque No DFWer has yet completed a single pass in The Game Itrsquos not too much better for Texas at large which hasnrsquot yet capitalized on becoming a fertile hotbed of bigtime quarterback talent Indeed only two high school Texan quarterbacks mdash Gary Kubiak and Drew Brees mdash have thrown passes in a Super Bowl But the 288 yards Brees mustered in Super Bowl XLIV gointo the Austin metro arearsquos ledger That leaves olrsquo ldquoKoobrdquo the Broncosrsquo current head coach who leads Denver against Carolina on Sunday as sixpoint underdogs Kubiak who attended Houstonrsquos St Pius X High School before becoming an Aggie also played for the Broncos in Super Bowl XXI and XXIV He totaled 76 yards and five completions on seven attempts in the two games Special teams provide our last points of comparison Here DFW finally gets it togetherIn the kickoff department DFWers have completed a total of 272 yards on 13 returns compared to Houstonrsquos 148 yards on seven returns In punt returns DFW nearly laps Houston with 82 yards on eight returns to their 42 yards on threeField goal kicking is another area where Dallas reigns supreme Here DFW kickers have made 12 of 16 field goals in all Super Bowls while chipping in all 19 extra point attempts Poor Houston metro meanwhile has only a single Super Bowl field goal kicker That would be Curt Knight of Mineral Wells who missed his only FG attempt for Washington in a losing Super Bowl VII effort As we head into the fourth quarter Houston metro does flip the field a bit with punting Here the area has produced three punters to pierce Super Bowl skies including The Woodlandsrsquo Lee Johnson who netted 221 yards on five punts in Super Bowl XXIII Dallasrsquo sole representative is Curley Johnson a Woodrow Wilson alum who kicked it at the University of Houston before heading to the NFL where he played for the New York Jets in Super Bowl IIInbspSo who wins Houston definitely has the upper hand in total yardage touchdowns and all that glamor position jazz but letrsquos not blow the final whistle yet Therersquos one last battleground The actual match upTo set it up I count two things The first is the number of times these playersrsquo teams won I also counted the number of times metro area alumni made unique contributing appearances in Super Bowls This means that I count only players who tallied at least one stat in the game I donrsquot let players double qualify for the same Super Bowl so nobody is included twice even if they got receiving and rushing yards for instance nbspIf somebody went to two Super Bowls and got stats in each that is considered two unique contributing appearances With that legalese out of the way herersquos the final verdict AllTime DFW Appearances 31 Alltime DFW Wins 19Winning percentage 613Alltime Houston metro Appearances 46 Alltime Houston metro Wins 21Winning percentage 457So there you have it its Dallas by a thin margin nbspNot unlike the Houston Texans in so many a regular season Houston shows promise early on but fades down the stretch nbsp
