                              The 
                                ultimate weakness of violence
                                is that it is a descending spiral
                                begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy
                                Instead of diminishing evil it multiplies it
                                Through violence you may murder the liar
                                but you cannot murder the lie nor establish the 
                                truth
                                Through violence you murder the hater
                                but you do not murder hate
                                In fact violence merely increases hate
                                Returning violence for violence multiples violence
                                adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid 
                                of stars
                                Darkness cannot drive out darkness only light 
                                can do that
                                Hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that

                                am happy to join with you today in what will go 
                                down in history as the greatest demonstration 
                                for freedom in the history of our nation  
                              
                              Five 
                                score years ago a great American in whose symbolic 
                                shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation 
                                This momentous decree came as a great beacon light 
                                of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been 
                                seared in the flames of withering injustice It 
                                came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night 
                                of captivity
                              But 
                                one hundred years later we must face the tragic 
                                fact that the Negro is still not free One hundred 
                                years later the life of the Negro is still sadly 
                                crippled by the manacles of segregation and the 
                                chains of discrimination One hundred years later 
                                the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty 
                                in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity 
                                One hundred years later the Negro is still languishing 
                                in the corners of American society and finds himself 
                                an exile in his own land So we have come here 
                                today to dramatize an appalling condition
                              In 
                                a sense we have come to our nations capital to 
                                cash a check When the architects of our republic 
                                wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution 
                                and the declaration of Independence they were 
                                signing a promissory note to which every American 
                                was to fall heir This note was a promise that 
                                all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights 
                                of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
                              
                              It 
                                is obvious today that America has defaulted on 
                                this promissory note insofar as her citizens of 
                                color are concerned Instead of honoring this 
                                sacred obligation America has given the Negro 
                                people a bad check which has come back marked 
                                quotinsufficient fundsquot But we refuse 
                                to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt 
                                We refuse to believe that there are insufficient 
                                funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this 
                                nation So we have come to cash this check  
                                a check that will give us upon demand the riches 
                                of freedom and the security of justice We have 
                                also come to this hallowed spot to remind America 
                                of the fierce urgency of now This is no time 
                                to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take 
                                the tranquilizing drug of gradualism Now is the 
                                time to rise from the dark and desolate valley
