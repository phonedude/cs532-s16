                                         On Sunday America celebrates a violent game People come together in groups to cheer on the excess and participate in it Before the third quarter starts I hope that everyone puts down the beer stops and watches an ad Just for 50 secondsThe ad is from a nonprofit called No More This organization exists to end domestic violence and sexual assault Those are things with which  the NFL has been associated with painful regularity So much so that footballs governing body has contributed financially to the making and airing of this adNo More says one in three women and one in four men experiences some form of violence at the hands of a partner One in five women is a survivor of rape The whole ad is just a series of texts being sent between friends on Super Bowl Sunday
    
    
 All seems well at first The texts begin to reveal a little more information Then the conversation suddenly stops The troubling truth hangs in the air Texts have become such a familiar method of communicating We fancy we can interpret nuances from the words our friends type from the speed with which they type them even from the things they dont say
