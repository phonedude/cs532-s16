Coldplay have the headline slot at the Super Bowl where theyre expected to be joined by Beyonce and Bruno Mars for a set that will last approximately 12 minutes 

Both the half time show and the night before shows are longstanding Super Bowl traditions The half time shows previous performers in recent years including Beyonce Katy Perry the Red Hot Chili Peppers Madonna and The Who While theyre not in the central role Metallica are a rarity in a set up that tends to ignore metal acts

In the UK the Super Bowl is being shown on BBC 2 with coverage starting at 11pm and the half time show expected some time in the early hours Last years worldwide audience for American footballs headline event was estimated at 160 million
