How Super Bowl 50 Became Ground Zero For The Fight Over Homelessness
San Franciscos spending on NFL celebrations has ignited protests over its treatment of the homeless

Advocates and local residents are angry that San Franciscosnbsphomeless peoplenbsphave to leave the area hosting Super Bowl City








Hundreds of San Francisco residents swarmed streets on Wednesday night to protest the cityrsquos treatment of homeless residents around its hosting of Super Bowl 50 celebrations
The protests were an outgrowth of Mayor Ed Leersquos August proclamation that the cityrsquos homeless would have to leave the area hosting Super Bowl City the popup ldquofan villagerdquo that blocked off portions of downtown even though the actual game will be played at Levirsquos Stadium 45 miles away in Santa Clara And in the days and weeks leading up to the Super Bowl word swept through San Francisco that the cityrsquos police have indeed been relocating homeless residents
ldquoThe Super Bowl ended up being this lightning rod for people who were seeing all this money being thrown around and then people suffering on the streets  and getting really frustrated with thatrdquo said Jennifer Friedenbach the executive director of the San Franciscobased Coalition on Homelessness which helped organize a protest march on Wednesday ldquoThat was what the protests came out ofrdquo
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has disputed claims that police are pushing the homeless out countering that they have provided ldquoalternativesrdquo afternbspopening additional shelter spaces But while homeless advocates say there is no definitive proof the city is sweeping the streets to remove unwanted residents there is enough anecdotal evidence to at least make homeless people feel they are being targeted
ldquoWersquore hearing over and over again that they feel like the police presence has increased and that theyrsquore being told to moverdquo Friedenbach said ldquoItrsquos frequently being mentioned to folks that itrsquos because of the Super Bowl that they need to move hellip From homeless peoplersquos perspective they feel like they are being displaced because of the Super Bowlrdquo
The protests which involved homeless San Franciscans advocacy group leaders and residents who oppose the cityrsquos handling of the issue are in part an outgrowth of the circumstances around the Super Bowl and the fact that it will cost San Francisco taxpayers nearly 5 million in city funds

From homeless peoples perspective they feel like they are being displaced because of the Super Bowl


Lawmakers and advocates including Friedenbach say the money spent celebrating the NFL could be better used to fight homelessness especially as rapidly rising housing prices put an increasing number of San Franciscans in precarious financial situations There arenbsp8000 homeless households waiting for space in public housing to open up and just one shelter bed for every six of the cityrsquos homeless residentsnbspaccording to the Coalition The latest survey of the citys homeless meanwhile found that the number of homeless people increased by 38 percent in 2014 and that the amount of elderly and sick people without homes has grown too There are alsonbspmore than 1400 young adultsnbspaged 18 to 24 living on the citys streets
The money San Francisco is spending on Super Bowl City could cover a year of housing subsidies for 500 homeless people Friedenbach said or go toward subsidies to keep those at risk of becoming homeless  particularly lowincome senior citizens  from losing their homes It would be enough to fund two additional ldquonavigation centersrdquo a pilot program that the city has used to help the homeless she said
Unlike Santa Clara San Francisco city leaders did not secure a contract with the Super Bowl host committee to ensure the costs of providing extra law enforcement and other public services would be reimbursed so it is paying the bills for a celebration of a private company  in this case the NFL  whose own annual revenues outpace the cityrsquos budget To lawmakers like Jane Kim who sits on San Franciscorsquos board of supervisors thatrsquos a poor reflection of the cityrsquos priorities
ldquoWere seeing an economic divide that is unprecedented in this cityrdquo Kim said A lot of folks feel like if youre not super wealthy you cant afford to live in San Francisco And they expect that we should be using taxpayer dollars to solve these important issuesnot to provide a party for some of the wealthiest people in the worldrdquo
ldquoThe NFL should pay for their own partyrdquo she added
Super Bowl backers including Lee say the celebration will bring enough revenues to cover San Franciscorsquos costs but Kim and many residents are skeptical  especially after the city emerged as a financial loser from hosting the Americarsquos Cup sailing tournament in 2014 and because other recent Super Bowl hosts have finished in the red
But the problems around homelessness go beyond the shortterm impact of temporary relocations and immediate costbenefit analyses Itrsquos irrelevant if there are ldquospecial sweepsrdquo to remove the homeless from certain parts of the city for the Super Bowl Friedenbach said because itrsquos clear that the normal criminalization of homelessness in San Francisco has persisted around the event  and will continue once the celebration is over
ldquoWhat we know is that homeless people are heavily criminalized in San Franciscordquo Friedenbach said ldquoThey have been before the Super Bowl and they will continue to be criminalized after the Super Bowl unless something serious changesrdquo
San Francisco has more antihomelessness laws than any other California city Friedenbach said and it issued more than 11000 citations to homeless residents merely for resting in public spaces last year according to the Coalition

San Francisco has been at the forefront of the criminalization thats happening against homeless people according to advocates



Threequarters of respondents to a Coalition homelessness surveynbsplast year said that law enforcement officers had approached them while 70 percent said police had forced them to leave a public space More than half said officers had searched them in the past year And the number of citations issued for homelessness is on the rise the cityrsquos park service issued six times as many citations for homelessness in 2014 as they did in 2011 and police citations increased three times from 2011 to 2013 according to the Coalitionrsquos data The targeting also disproportionately affected minority and transgender people the survey found
Other protests organized and otherwise have emerged across the city as well San Franciscans have repeatedly toppled the goldplated ldquo50rdquo statues that were placed around the city to commemorate the Super Bowlrsquos golden anniversary and thousands of Uber drivers upset with fare cuts that they say have left many of them earning less than the minimum wage have threatened to ldquoshut downrdquo local highways on Super Bowl Sunday 
Other cities have weathered protests during Super Bowl week beforenbspBut none of the concerns around the Super Bowl have resonated quite like homelessness The Coalition has received an outpouring of support and offers to help in the past week Friedenbach said while city residents have stepped up in their own ways too some have donated tents to homeless residents while others volunteered to help the Coalition to help it set up a web site NotSoSuperSForg to draw attention to their cause
These problems are not unique to San Francisco particularly in the context of prioritizing public spending on NFL teams and venues over addressing homelessness A formerly homeless man in St Louis for instance filed a lawsuit against the city in 2014 as it tried to devote hundreds of millions of dollars to a new stadium for the St Louis Rams who eventually moved to Los Angeles arguing that the city should put the funds toward homelessness initiatives insteadnbsp

I hear it over and over again from our residents they want us to spend our dollars on affordability on homelessness on mental health services  not on a party for the rich


But the issues have received more attention in San Francisco perhaps because itnbsphas really been at the forefront of the criminalization thats happening against homeless people Friedenbach said
And its supposed to be such a liberal city so theres a juxtaposition there that is really interesting to a lot of people she said
There are signs that public officials have taken notice Friedenbach said she and the Coalition are scheduled to meet with Lee on Tuesday to discuss ways to improve the cityrsquos treatment of the homeless They are also backing laws in the state legislature that would change the enforcement of antihomelessness laws
ldquoIf they had the political will to create a sustained revenue source for addressing homelessness in San Francisco they could do itrdquo Friedenbach said
Kim meanwhile is pushing for a new citywide ordinance that aims to ensure there isnrsquot a repeat of Super Bowl City where San Francisco hands over millions of city funds without a close examination of what it is getting in return When it comes to the Super Bowl it is likely too late to renegotiate the cityrsquos deal to get the NFL or Host Committee to reimburse San Franciscorsquos costs But Kim and others argue it should be cause to reexamine how the city approaches future events
ldquoThe debate that were having right nowrdquo she said ldquois what is the appropriate way to invest taxpayer dollars back in the city I hear it over and over again from our residents they want us to spend our dollars on affordability on homelessness on mental health servicesnot on a party for the richrdquo
ldquoLets acknowledge that its wrong and lets try to fix itrdquo Kim said ldquoAnd if we cant do it for this event certainly for the futurerdquo
