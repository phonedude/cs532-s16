    Bernies New Health Care Plan is A Mathematically Challenged Flat Tax Disaster
    
      Spandan Chakrabarti
      January 18 2016
    
  
    
  
  

  A day after we at TPV took apart Bernie Sanders 2013 bill to tear up all existing public financing of health care to gamble it on a Medicaidexemption style court decision allowing states to skirt the program and a day before the Democratic debate this weekend Bernie Sanders released a brand new health care plan with the catchy title Medicare for AllIn reality not much has changed in Bernies new plan except that to avoid the court challenge I wrote about he devises his campaign plan to be federally administered This would certainly preclude states from challenging the law on the grounds of having to run and fund a program they dont like The other change in his plan is that he now allows for deductions before applying a flat tax on employeesBut if the federal government alone administers a singlepayer system it needs to finance it all on its own and this is where Bernies gamble is both a regressive flat tax disaster and woefully inadequate Lets dive inThe Regressive Flat TaxAccording to the Sanders campaign the plan will cost an additional 138 trillion a year for the government in exchange for removing all the private costs of health care and it would be financed by a 62 additional  and flat  payroll taxincomebased premium on the employer or the selfemployed a 22 additional income tax after deductions slightly increasing marginal rates on the wealthy and taxing capital gains at the same rate as earned incomenbspThe vast majority of the revenue even by Sanders own estimation comes from a combined 84 flat tax on most income 60 or 830 billion of the 138 trillion he says hed need is raised that way nbspDont believe me read it yourselfIn actuality the rate is a slightly higher Consider that Bernies plan would abolish necessarily the taxexempt status of both employer and employee premiums effectively raising taxable income and therefore the amount of Bernies health care premium tax slightly moreThats right Bernie Sanders wants an additional 85 flat tax on income on the vast majority of income earners When did liberals become advocates for flat taxes If this is how we are going to finance our progressive revolution please Bernie keep your changeNot only is Bernie Sanders the white pearl of revolutionaries everywhere openly peddling a flat tax and punishing the poor small business and selfemployed his numbers unsurprisingly dont add upDo Families Save Money Under a Sanders Plan Not NecessarilySanders claims that under his plan a family of four making 50000 would pay only 466 in additional taxes in exchange for saving a combined 6273 4955 in premiums and 1318 in deductibles nbspthe average family plan premium and deductible Pretty good deal rightNot so fast Bernies math is a tortured pretzel First of all the average American family of four does not make 50000 That is roughly the median not average for allnbsphouseholds actually around 53K but families with children on average make more According to Census data the average household income for families with children was roughly 90000 in 2014 We will use average mean here rather than median because Sanders carefully worded campaign document is working with the average premium and deductibles paid by families not medianSo for that average family with a small business Bernies plan would cost 1364 in additional taxes adjusting for the standard deduction and it would cost their employers an additional 5580 What if the income comes from selfemployment like a small family business That now costs the family a combined 6944  notably morenbspthan they pay right nowAnd dont let anyone fool you that the employer portion of the premiums in the form of an added 62 payroll tax isnt really coming out of an employees pocket Employers are unlikely to simply replace the health insurance premiums they pay now with the payroll tax since under Bernies plan they would lose the tax deductions for providing health care Because this premium tax would be linked to income itd give employers a reason to simply suppress wages rather than reduce health care costs as is currently incentivized under the Affordable Care Act It would keep young healthy workers from starting at higher wages as their health care costs would be low and it would keep older experienced workers from climbing up the wage ladder since paying a lower wage means a lower health premium taxLet me repeat that if you factor in Bernies new flat taxesnbspthe average family with children would pay more under Bernies plan than they do right nownbspBut but but What about that family of 4 making 50K Even if they are not the average they still count and Bernie does reduce their cost right Not universally and especially not if we account for the fact that the premium tax on income levied on the employer is in fact a tax on the income earner Take Bernies estimate of 422 for just the employee income tax side again adjusting for the standard deductible and add the extra payroll premium of 3100 a year or a total of 3522 in costs for that familyThis is especially bad news if you live in a state like California which Bernie would punish for doing the right thing and accepting Obamacares Medicaid expansion A quick search on Covered California the states exchange shows that a family of 4 making 50000 in Santa Clara County could pay as little as 2 a month in premiums after Obamacares premium assistance is factored in and the children would qualify for MediCal Californias version of Medicaid This would cost them 24 a year in premiums but as a high deductible plan would only make sense for relatively healthy parents for whom reaching 3500 in deductibles would be difficultIf that family chooses the recommended Enhanced 73nbspnbsplevel of coverage they could find coverage for 260 a month bringing the total premium to 3120 annually not the 5580 Bernie advertisesnbspwith a maximum family deductible of 3800 but again no one really uses the maximum deductible every yearnbspBoth plans would allow the range of free preventive care that is now the law under ObamacareSo again in many cases even Bernies average family will end up worse off under his plan than under the current system even if we ignore employer sponsored coverageBut Bernies trouble with math doesnt end there Hes claiming savings in the system that are not only unrealistic but nearly impossibleThe Math Still Stinks Bernies Own Votes and Data Belie Savings Needed for His Plan to WorkWith current estimates from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Studies total national health expenditure will average 41 trillion per year over the next 10 years including population growth cost growth and inflation and Sanders claims that his plan would save 6 trillion over 10 years which would bring the average to 35 trillion Thats a 15 total saving from todays estimates in the short term of 10 yearsLets make a quick note that in Bernies 2013 bill almost this exact portion of the costs  a 14 average  was mandated on the states in addition to federal spending HmmNow roughly 44 of national health expenditures are private spending including private health insurance and individual spending copays deductibles cash services In real terms Sanders only option is to save in what is currently private spending as he along with the rest of Congress has voted again and again to prevent provider payment decreases in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates are already below that of MedicareSo if one has to achieve 15 savings from just 44 of the spending that necessitates a 34 savings against projected private health care spending But Medicare reimbursement rates which Sanders has voted again and again to increase or keep at the same levels are currently just 20 below the average private insurance reimbursement ratesWhat about prescription drug spending Those are too high right Yes but even there we dont have enough room to achieve a 34 saving A paper published last year by Public Citizen one of the most optimistic estimates claimed that if the government could negotiate Medicare Part D would save 16 billion of its 693 billion annual price tag That is 23 and the total current public spending on prescription drugs is minute compared to the total scale of national health expendituresIncidentally we might point out that Barack Obama already negotiated the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare Part D down as part of the Affordable Care Act and closing the coverage gapAt the very least Bernies current plan belies his lifelong voting record and he in fact has no problem cutting funding for the current public programs In the alternative he has to raise much heavier regressive flat taxes on low and middle income Americans but that doesnt sound too good in an election year making his plan nothing more than a cynical campaign ployThis is the risk Bernie Sanders is asking us to take He wants us to allow him to tear up Medicare Medicaid Childrens Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act for a mathematically challenged unmitigated flat tax disaster of a plan
