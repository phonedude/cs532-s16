Where does Malcolm Butlers gameclinching interception in Super Bowl XLIX rank on this list

The Top 50 Super Bowl Moments of All Time Each of the previous 49 Super Bowls has had its share of memorable moments and each is special to fans in its own unique way You could ask 10 people their top 10 moments in Super Bowl history and you would get 10 different lists The following are my unbiased consensusless 50 greatest moments in Super Bowl history Note I did not include halftime shows or commercialsnbspRelatednbspRanking the Super Bowls From I to XLIXnbsp50 Super Bowl XLI Devin Hester Returns Opening Kickoff for TouchdownArguably the greatest kick returner of all time became the only player in Super Bowl history to return the opening kickoff for a touchdown The Colts chose wisely and decided not to kick to him for the rest of the gamenbsp49 Super Bowl I The Game Airs on Two

Vikings Chiefs head coach Hank Stram called the play ldquo65 Toss Power Traprdquo and Mike Garrett ran into the end zone for the touchdown The play is immortalized because Stram was miked for sound

interview that ldquotwo hammers would be enoughrdquo to stop Packers receivers Carroll Dale and Boyd Dowler Williamson was actually the one knocked out of the game when his head hit the knee of running back Donny Anderson The irony was not lost on the football worldnbsp41 Super Bowl XVII Fulton Walkerrsquos Record ReturnWith his Dolphins tied 1010 with the Redskins shortly before halftime Walker returned a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown At the time it was the longest kick return in Super Bowl historynbsp40 Super Bowl XXI Phil McConkey Catches Tipped Touchdown PassTrailing the Broncos

handsnbsp39 Super Bowl XXXI Brett Favrersquos Celebrates His First TouchdownAfter completing his first touchdown pass a 54yard strike to Andre Rison Brett Favre took his helmet off and ran around the

end zone for the touchdown The Redskins never recovered from the playnbsp37 Super Bowl VI Bob Griese is Sacked for a 29Yard LossIn the first half the Dolphins quarterback took the snap on his own

Billsrsquo celebrated offense took the field against the Redskins they were missing their star running back Thomas couldnrsquot find his helmet because someone had moved it during the pregame

Sports a Big Yellow RibbonDuring the Iran hostage crisis from 197981 wearing a yellow ribbon symbolized that you wanted those Americans held at the US Embassy in Tehran to be freed The Louisiana

Bowl X Jack Lambert Tosses Cliff Harris to the GroundDown 107 to the Cowboys Steelers kicker Roy Gerela lined up for a 33yard field goal and missed his second attempt of the game When Cowboy safety

remember himnbsp29 Super Bowl XXVIII Emmitt Smith Takes ControlAfter going in at halftime down 136 to the Bills the Cowboys tied the game and then put together a 64yard touchdown drive Smith accounted

zone for a touchback Lettrsquos big mistake was slowing downnbsp25 Super Bowl XIII Jackie Smith is the Sickest Man in AmericaSmith was one of the best tight ends to ever play the game It is a shame

Staubach threw a pass to Smith in the end zone which he dropped Cowboysrsquo radio announcer Verne Lundquist immortalized the play when he said ldquoBless his heart hersquos got to be the sickest man in Americardquonbsp24 Super Bowl XXX Larry Brown Snags Two PicksBrown became an unlikely Super Bowl MVP when he intercepted two Neil OrsquoDonnell passes in the second half The Steelers quarterback

opportunityrdquonbsp23 Super Bowl III Joe Namath Raises His FingerAfter upsetting the Colts the generally loquacious Jets quarterback did not need to say anything He simply raised his forefinger as he ran off the field to tell the crowd what they already knownbsp22 Super Bowl XXI The ldquoOriginalrdquo Gatorade ShowerThere is a bit of disagreement over who actually started the Gatorade shower but

VII ldquoGarorsquos GafferdquoLeading the Redskins 140 in the final minutes of the game kicker Garo Yepremian lined up to kick a field goal that would have capped the Dolphinsrsquo 170 season with a 170 win Yepremianrsquos kick was too low and blocked Yepremian then picked up the ball and attempted a pitiful pass which was intercepted by cornerback Mike Bass who ran it into the end zone for a touchdown It remains the greatest folly in Super Bowl historynbsp15 Super Bowl XLVI Mario Manningham Keeps Giants Alive with Spectacular CatchDown 1715 to the Patriots late in the fourth quarter the Giants attempted one last drive They were able to score thanks to a spectacular sideline catch by Manningham at midfieldnbsp14 Super Bowl XVIII Marcus Allen Runs with the NightMarcus Allen rushed for
