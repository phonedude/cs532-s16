                                                                          No aspect of players football lives is more debilitating controversial or paradoxical than injuries and their consequences The media strike a frightening chorus The NFL is killing its players and the league doesnt care Most pro football players face a future of disability and pain Retired NFL players experience living hell At the same time other sources proclaimas Sports Illustrated put itNFL players in general live longer than their American male peers and theres evidence that theyre in better health than their nonplayer counterparts in many respects Even more strikingly we read that former NFL players    are overwhelmingly happy they played in the league including more than 85 percent of players who suffered at least five major NFL injuries Player after player culminates his story of NFL mayhem with the same surprising refrain Id do it all over again in a heartbeat In recent years the NFL has undertaken massive rule changes to curb violent hits and combat disabling injury yet players overwhelmingly say the league is going too far I understand that they want the sport to be safer laments AllPro safety Troy Polamalu But eventually youre going to start to take away from the essence of this game and its not really going to be the football that we all love In spite of all they know about the prospects of disabling injury players say they dont want to be protected Its a tough mans game and they want it that way No doubt football is violent and dangerous thats part of its appeal But its also part of the enduring mark it leaves on players NFL Sundaysbut also practices and workoutsclearly jeopardize players health There were more than 30000 injuries in the NFL from 2002 through 2011 including nearly 4500 in 2011 alone Thats more than two per active player While some of these are fleeting and recovery is complete theres hardly a player who leaves the game without painful reminders of his violent past Ninetythree percent of former players missed at least one game due to a major injury and over half report suffering three or more major injuries during their NFL careers Eightysix percent report that they underwent orthopedic surgery as a result of a football injury A substantial majority of explayers said that injury played some role in ending their careers   If the surgical scars arent reminder enough nine out of ten former players wake up each day to nagging aches and pains that they attribute to football About eight in ten report that the pain lasts most of the day Among younger retirees aged 30 to 49 one third say their work lives are limited in some way by the aftereffects of injury Retired players are much less likely than their age peers in the general population to rate their health as excellent or good and nearly 30 percent of NFL retirees rate their health as only fair or poor Even though mortality rates among former players are lower than the general population in many other respects its a grim picture Many former NFL players are damaged goods The Concussion Crisis In August 2013 the NFL reached an outofcourt settlement with over 4500 former NFL players who sought damages stemming from disabilities brought on by head injuries suffered while playing in the league The players alleged that the NFL had willfully concealed information circulated significant misinformation and obstructed research indicating that players put themselves at severe risk of chronic brain disease by playing pro football The NFL agreed to pay up to 765 million to fund medical exams concussionrelated disability compensation and a program of medical research into brain injuries Payouts would extend over 20 years with 50 percent coming in the first three The agreement explicitly states that the settlement in no way represents an admission by the NFL of liability or a concession that the plaintiffs injuries were caused by football   The settlement actually extends beyond those players who filed suit and covers all 18000 of the leagues retired players quadrupling the number eligible to receive compensation Players can opt out of the settlement thus declining compensation but retaining their right to pursue further legal action All retired players or their families are eligible for compensation if they can show severe cognitive injury or impairment related to NFL football but players who died before 2006 and their families will be excluded from benefits The settlement caps payments at 3 million per individual for dementia 4 million for chronic traumatic encephalopathy CTE and 5 million for Lou Gehrigs disease ALS Parkinsons disease Alzheimers disease or another severe cognitive impairment At the time of the provisional settlement there appeared to be at least 300 cases of former players who would qualify in the highest compensation categories While the NFL admitted no legal liability the settlement is a tacit admission that the NFL has actively prevented players from knowing the full extent to which they were inviting chronic brain disease by playing in the NFLinformation vital to making informed decisions about their longterm physical and mental health The NFLs shameful complicity in suppressing information about the consequences of concussions and its attempts to thwart scientific research into concussions and their aftermath were further unmasked by media exposs such as the 2013 book League of Denial and an accompanying PBS Frontline documentary of the same title Theres little question that brain injury is a much more serious problem than the NFL has wanted to admit Momentarily setting aside the controversy over concussion research at the heart of the lawsuit whats most remarkable in this scenario is the sheer number of former players claiming significant brain damage from playing in the NFL More than 4500 living players maintain that they have symptoms of footballrelated brain damage Thats nearly a quarter of all living NFL alumni A 2013 Washington Post survey found that around 90 percent of former players indicate that they suffered at least one concussion while they were playing Of those who did two thirds say they still experience symptoms The NFL Player Care studycommissioned by the NFL itselfasked alumni respondents if they had ever been diagnosed with dementia Alzheimers disease or other memoryrelated disease While relatively few reported such diagnoses comparisons with age peers in the general male population are shocking Older retirees 50 and older are five times more likely to report such diagnoses 61 to 12 while younger alums 3049 are 19 times more likely 19 to 01 Moreover neurodegenerative mortality among a 1959 through 1988 cohort of NFL players was three times higher than that of the general population and the mortality rate for this cohort due to Alzheimers disease or ALS was four times higher While these data dont say that football wreaks havoc on all players they clearly suggest that former NFL players are dramatically more likely than the average man on the street to suffer from longterm brain damage   Every NFL player has his bell rung These shots to the head are likely to cause concussions They leave players momentarily stunned disoriented seeing stars feeling woozy The most pronounced symptoms may pass in a few minutes but headaches impaired vision memory loss or cognitive fuzziness may persist Nevertheless most players simply play through the symptoms getting back into action as soon as they can The medical definition of a concussion is a bit more ominous Its a brain injury caused by a force transmitted to the head that results in a collision between the brain and the skull that surrounds it When someone takes a jolt to the head the brain bangs around inside the skull case The collision sets off organic neurological and chemical reactions that alter the brain and disrupt its functions Theres a wide range of possible symptoms loss of consciousness memory loss slowed reaction times cognitive impairment drowsiness headaches irritability and emotional fluctuations Some people even go temporarily blind Most of these symptoms however resolve spontaneously   No two concussions are alike Some are more serious than others and some may persist for days if not weeks NFL players have shook off  the effects of concussions since the game began There are countless stories of players having their bells rung but playing on not knowing what they were doing and remembering nothing afterwards In one memorable instance Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman was dingedkneed in the headduring the January 24 1994 NFC championship game Aikman had played well and the Cowboys beat the 49ers but Aikman ended up in the hospital with a concussion He couldnt remember anything about the game Steve Young a contemporary of Aikmans and a fellow Hall of Famer was once asked about how many concussions he suffered His reply You mean official ones    An official one is when youre knocked out and carted off the field But I get dinged all the time and just continue to play We might dumb down the playbook a little bit but I couldnt count those Jim Otto Hall of Fame center from the AFL and NFL probably took as many hits to the head as anyone Ive had over 20 concussions myself    There were so many times that I would walk off the field and my eyes would be crossed Did you ever have that happen to you Get hit in the head so hard your eyes were crossed You sit there Its strange its really strange Or what about if you had amnesia for two days When you looked at your wife and you didnt know who she was like whos this chick And you couldnt remember You got hit in the head and you had amnesia Eventually Aikman Young Otto and hundreds of others whose bells have been rung snap out of itmore or less For generations that meant that they were good to go But part of the recent concussion controversy has centered on exactly what happens over the long run when the brain is jarred enough to produce concussion symptoms By his own count Mike Webster Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs from 1974 to 1990 played in 300 games going back to high school without missing a single game He reckoned hed shown up for 890 of a possible 900 practices in the NFL Hed knocked heads literally tens of thousands of times in the pit of the offensive line Within a few short years of his retirement Websters everyday aches and pains became severe He battled hand and foot afflictions His teeth began to fall out In addition to physical deterioration many friends and associates noted that there was something wrong inside his head He couldnt sleep He became paranoid and behaved erratically His speech was scattered and disjointed His memory failed repeatedly He lost his balance He took on a vacant lookno emotion no affect His cognitive functioning slipped He was beat up and discombobulated according to his doctor Ultimately Webster became socially dysfunctional He couldnt hold a job or live normally in the company of others His family couldnt cope with his erratic behavior and his wife divorced him He simply wasnt the man they had loved and grown up with He came to rely upon Ritalin to maintain momentary focus but eventually abused the drug and began forging dozens of prescriptions His life became the horror story of an unbalanced erratic transient   Finally Webster with the assistance of a team of friends doctors and attorneys filed for NFL disability benefits presenting testimony from four physicians to establish that Webster had disabling brain damage due to his play in the league The NFL however dragged its feet The Retirement Plan Disability Board insisted on a fifth handpicked independent neurologist When he agreed with Websters doctors the NFL finally granted Webster total and permanent disability benefits The leagues explanation for the decision included an extraordinary admission Websters disability is the result of head injuries suffered as a football player with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Kansas City Chiefs This concession would become even more significant when subsequent concussion litigation arose Websters story however doesnt end with the disability board Three years later his maladies caught up with him and he died ultimately from heart problems at age 52 During a routine autopsy however the forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu noted that the death certificate indicated that Webster had suffered from depression secondary to postconcussion syndrome Not a football fan himself Omalu recalled media stories of football great Mike Websters erratic behavior and tragic demise and realized that this was the very same Webster on his examination table The body was ravaged beyond belief but when Omalu examined Websters brain it looked completely normal a startling anomaly Curious Omalu got permission to study Websters brain His findings set off a torrent of questions followed by a flood of research that eventually morphed into a major controversy   Beneath the surface Mike Websters brain was anything but normal He had a serious pathology thats come to be known as CTE The condition is a progressive degenerative disease found in athletes and others with a history of repetitive brain trauma This might include symptomatic concussions as well as asymptomatic subconcussive blows to the head The head trauma triggers progressive degeneration of the brain tissuethe scientific literature often refers to this as a pathologic cascade The pathology includes the buildup of an abnormal substance called tau a protein that enables the brain to function but that can also strangle it if the tau congeals into clumps called neurofibrillary tangles These tangles can choke neurons inside the brain causing a wide variety of problems The changes in brain chemistry associated with CTE may begin months years or even decades after the last brain trauma CTE is insidious It may lead to memory loss confusion impaired judgment impulse control problems aggression depression cognitive impairment and eventually progressive dementia As the disease progresses symptoms become more severe and broader in scope Memories fail Victims cant concentrate or focus their attention The brains executive functioning declines victims organizing capacity fails they cant plan things out they exhibit poor judgment and multitasking suffers Sometimes speaking becomes disjointed or difficult Victims become uncharacteristically irritable impulsive or aggressive Some become completely apathetic at times in complete contrast to other outbursts of aggressive behavior Others suffer from depression paranoia even suicidal tendencies Instrumental activities are compromised so that routines of everyday life become impossible Ultimately fullblown dementia may set in While CTE may have symptoms similar to Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative conditions its organic presentation is different Equally important whereas Alzheimers disease and other dementias appear later in life CTE shows up in relatively young people   Mike Webster was only 52 and the interior of his brain was laced with tangles of tau Given the statistical evidence of widespread aftereffects of head injuries how likely is it that former NFL players are actually suffering the ravages of CTE Clearly all of them arent symptomatic But most have had concussions and thousands claimed some sort of brain damage in the 2013 law suit For years the NFL steadfastly denied that concussions were common or that they had any lasting health consequences Moreover the league completely rejected the notion that head injuries sustained playing in the NFL caused lasting brain damage or disease These denials were at the heart of the former players lawsuit The NFL they argued had been deceptive by denying the harmful effects of head injuries and suppressing information about the dangers of playing in the league Without all available information the suit argued players could not make intelligent informed decisions about the risks they were taking Late in 2013 awardwinning journalists Mark FainaruWada and Steve Fainaru pulled back the curtain on the NFLs deception in a relentless account of how for decades league officials manipulated information about the incidence prevalence and consequences of concussions in the NFL League of Denial vividly details how the NFL misrepresented data conducted questionable research and attempted to suppress and discredit research others were doing on concussions and their aftermath Along the way the NFL compromised the professional peer review process to get its own research published in scientific journals exerted illegitimate influence to suppress other scientists research findings and attacked the work and character of legitimate researchers who produced findings contrary to the NFL party line  The NFL was covering up a mounting body of evidence that Mike Websters case was far from unique In a staggering series of tragedies former NFL players Andre Waters John Grimsley Terry Long Dave Duerson Ray Easterling and Junior Seau committed suicide Tom McHale died of a drug overdose Justin Strzelczyk was killed in a car crash after leading police on a 37mile highspeed chase Each man had exhibited striking behavior and mood changes leading up to his death Autopsies showed they all had CTE In the past few years autopsy after autopsy of the brains of former players have shown signs of CTE By the fall of 2013 Boston University researcher Dr Ann McKee had examined the brains of 46 deceased former NFL players Fortyfive of them had CTE  While theres a notable sampling bias in the collection of the cases studiedbrains tend to be donated for study by families of deceased players who were suspected of having brain diseasethe consistency of these findings is compelling Moreover not a single case of CTE has been found that wasnt preceded by some sort of brain trauma Does this mean that all NFL players have or will get CTE No Does it mean that every player who suffers a concussion will develop CTE Again the answer is probably no Its nearly impossible to establish a certain causal link between suffering a concussion and developing CTE Given the evidence currently available its also difficult to establish the likelihood that a former player or a player who suffered a concussion will develop CTE The incidence and prevalence of the disease are still unknown But some scientistssuch as Ann McKee who has probably examined more postmortem cases of CTE than anyoneare willing to speculate The incidence and prevalence of CTE we wont know those until we have a way to detect it in living people Then we can look at thousands of people who play these sports and really come up with an incidence and a prevalence    We have over 70 deceased football players with this disease from all levels and weve done that in five years I just dont think we could do that with a rare disorder I just dont think its possible Even if we were selecting for families that thought that the individual had the disease we have an enormously high hit rate    So I think the incidence and prevalence have to be a lot higher than people realize And I also think that given the worst of circumstances if you take a single year and you look at all the NFL deaths in a single year and thats your denominator and on the numerator you put all the cases that weve had with CTE of NFL players assuming that we got the only cases of CTE of NFL players ever anywhere its about 10 percent Ten percent of NFL players get CTE Well thats a huge percentage if you ask me And thats the lowest it can be   The conservative estimate that ten percent of former NFL players might have CTE accompanied with the dramatic autopsy evidence casts the NFL coverup in an even more unflattering light It squarely implicates the league in the documented tragedies of players with CTE whove violently taken their own lives It raises the possibility that other violent incidentsfor example the case of former Kansas City Chiefs tackle Jim Tyrer who murdered his wife then killed himselfmay have resulted from footballrelated brain disease Equally important the research suggests that the NFL may be liable for damages to thousands of former players who develop CTE and who may someday suffer the debilitating aftershocks of the hits they took in the NFL This corroborates the leagues tacit admission in the lawsuit settlement and its ontherecord acknowledgment that Mike Websters disability was the result of head injuries suffered as a football player in the NFL A telling pronouncement came late in 2009 in the wake of congressional hearings on the NFLs concussion crisis when Greg Aiello the leagues communications director quietly confessed Its quite obvious from the medical research thats been done that concussions can lead to longterm problems This is the only time anyone from the NFL has publicly acknowledged a connection between football and brain disease In the shadow of this mountain of damning evidence the concussion lawsuit settlement between players and the NFL has generated considerable conjecture On one hand 765 million dollars is a hefty sum On the other hand spread across a possible 4500 claimants it amounts to a relatively small average individual payout 17000 An expanded number of claimants further dilutes the settlement pool Why then did the two sides settle so quickly   From the NFLs point of view the 765 million payout pales in comparison to possible damages that might be awarded should the league lose the case in court That amount could rise into the billions While 765 million is nothing to scoff at the NFL is a multibilliondollar industry that can absorb the financial hit Perhaps more importantly by settling the case out of court and signing an agreement that doesnt admit liability for players head injuries the NFL dodges the prospect of establishing legal precedent that could be cited in future litigation which might cost the league even more Then why didnt the players press their advantage Certainty is the key factor Coupled with the immediate needs of many currently disabled players a guaranteed payout is appealing No court case is a sure thing and even in victory the amount of an eventual award is uncertain It could be enormous but it might also fall short of expectations Should the players lose they might not get a cent and hundreds of players could find themselves in dire straits with no help whatsoever The NFL has the resources to effectively oppose the litigation and drag out the process for years if not decades For players with pressing medical and financial problems a huge payoff ten years down the road isnt very promising They and their families might not last that long Most crucially despite the mounting scientific evidence and swelling public support establishing the NFLs liability in court is a difficult proposition The case would shape up much like class action suits against the tobacco industry where for years epidemiological evidence wasnt sufficient to establish legal liability In order to win a judgment the players would need to prove that the NFL knowingly placed players in harms waythat the league knew that playing NFL football caused chronic debilitating brain damage and that the players were kept ignorant of the imminent danger   The initial challenge would be to establish that players didnt know that football could cause brain damage This is a major hurdle because everyone knows that football is a violent game fraught with danger The second key issue would be establishing a direct causal link between injuries incurred on an NFL playing field and brain damage Its virtually certain that playing football leads to widespread concussions There is also convincing scientific evidence that multiple instances of brain traumaespecially repeated concussions but also repeated subconcussive eventsare associated with chronic brain disease But this evidence is probabilistic not experimental That is it can be established that NFL players as a group are likely to suffer concussions And players suffering concussions are likely as a group to develop brain disease But court decisions dont hinge on probabilities Cases are adjudicated based on clear if not certain causal connections between individual circumstances and individual outcomes Heres where the players case becomes difficult In defending their case the NFL would argue that a player needed to establish the direct link between an injury incurred in the NFL and the subsequent development of brain disease They would require players to provide documentation of brain injuries while playing in the NFL and while such documentation is increasingly available prior to 2000 almost none existed Data currently at hand is unsystematic and often anecdotal Team and player medical records are often inconclusive about the number timing and extent of player injuries Players themselves are complicit in this shadowy documentation because they are notorious for not letting team officials know theyre hurt They get their bells rung shake it off and get back on the field even if they cant see clearly or remember where they are or what theyre doing Retrospective accounts of unreported concussions are not compelling legal evidence Even if a history of NFLrelated concussions could be established the defense would demand that claimants prove those injuries directly resulted in debilitating brain disease Again the evidence is largely probabilistic It doesnt establish the certainty of causality an argument that would surely be front and center in any litigation For example all neuropathologically confirmed cases of CTE have a history of brain trauma but not all individuals with exposure to brain trauma develop CTE Players may be likely to suffer brain disease but to win a court case a player must establish that specific injuries directly caused his own specific debilitating outcomes   Players would also be required to rule out other possible causes of brain disease This too is difficult The NFL would argue that everyone concussions or nothas some probability of eventually developing brain disease The onus would be on the player to prove that other factors that might reasonably cause brain diseasesfor example heredity routine lifestyle choices normal aging and myriad other alternate explanations for players current conditionswere not involved Even more daunting from the players perspective is the prospect of ruling out other nonNFL head injuries as the cause of current medical problems This is virtually impossible Nearly every NFL player has participated in four to ten years of organized football before reaching the NFL including hundreds of games and thousands of practices The NFL would argue that this participation almost certainly contributed to current medical conditions thus absolving the league from liability for the present state of affairs Whats more since recent scientific evidence suggests that initial concussions render players more susceptible to subsequent brain trauma the league could argue that concussions experienced in high school andor college were the precipitating cause of brain diseasethat players already had preexisting conditions before they reached the NFL Players would be required to demonstrate that this was not plausibly the case Proving that an elite high school and college player never had his bell rung is a tall order Given the challenges faced by both parties to the litigation the settlement represents a compromise based on the perceived risks and rewards for both sides The NFL limits damage and heads off catastrophic precedents The players take home a guaranteed payoff without having to prove a problematic case that might involve years of litigation Those gravely in need will get help almost immediately The compromise cost the NFL 765 million The players forfeit the possibility of a multibilliondollar payday Both sides can claim public relations victories The NFL hasnt admitted responsibility for player injuries The league can say it is simply doing whats right by taking care of its players and former players For their part the players can point to the tacit admission of guilt by the NFL and the quick and substantial payout to players who really need the help   Reaction to the settlement has been decidedly mixed The feedback is complicated by players defiant attitude toward injury itself For many of them injury is just a part of the game that has to be accepted Jim Otto obviously deserves considerable help from the NFL for the injuries hes suffered Hes more than willing to talk about the steep price he paid for his career But hes adamant about accepting responsibility for his fate He doesnt want the NFLs help or its money Nobody is giving me any special help And over here these guys the players filing suit are wanting the world Theyre suing everybody for a lot of money which I dont like because thats going to hurt football in high school Little League and in the pros    Theyre going to cost so much money that the owners and high schools wont be able to afford the insurance for the game and stuff like that Im against all that Lets play football Asked about the evidence that former players are suffering the debilitating effects of concussions and CTE Otto responds Well Im trying in my mind not to relate that to my situation you know    I dont want to believe that thats whats happened    Those are the battle scars of a gladiator The gladiator goes until he cant go anymore And thats what Im doing    I dont want to make excuses    I knew about concussions Otto isnt alone in stoically accepting his fate but others are equally adamant that the players settled for far too little 765 million asks former Minnesota Viking Brent Boyd one of the original plaintiffs in the lawsuit The breakdown is 12 million over 20 years per team What is that a third of the average salary There is no penalty there Its pocket change Boyd has a point In the broader scheme of things the NFL stands to make somewhere between 200 billion and 500 billion over the 20 years during which the league will dispense the 765 million settlement award Viewed in this context it is indeed pocket change   In January 2014 Judge Anita Brody raised precisely this issue when she denied preliminary legal approval of the settlement Brodys central concern was that not all retired NFL players who ultimately receive a qualifying diagnosis or their families will be adequately paid under the current plan She also objected to a lack of data in support of the settlements economic assumptions In July 2014 the NFL agreed to remove a 675 million cap on compensatory claims for players with neurological symptoms and Brody granted preliminary approval But its not only about the money Like many other players former NFLPA president and Pro Bowl center Kevin Mawae is disappointed that the NFL hasnt admitted culpability Fans see 765 million and they think its a windfall for the players Its great for    the guys that would fall in the category of needing immediate help he says But its 700 million worth of hush money that they will never have to be accountable for Anticipating future litigation Mawae argues that the NFL hasnt had to disclose damaging information it has withheld for years He calls the settlement a pittance a relative drop in the bucket The league won he laments Former Packer Dorsey Levins another plaintiff also wanted an admission of liability but acknowledges the need for immediate help When a guy with symptoms of CTE calls me and says Ive called the NFL five times I cant get a response My head hurts all the time And if I cant get help Im going to take care of it end his life I couldnt sleep What do you say to a guy like that In the larger health picture where do former players stand in the wake of all this Many are suffering the aftereffects of hits to the head Some are enduring the ravages of CTE Theres some financial relief on the way but its not as much as it appears at first glance Some players may receive several million dollars but the average payout is going to be far less Perhaps the most chilling insight to come out of the concussion crisis is the realization for players that many of them may be looking down a very bleak road to a future of mental decline and disability They wonder if its already happening Upon hearing of Junior Seaus suicide and the speculation that it was CTE induced Steve Young pleaded with his friend and former teammate Gary Plummer Please bro tell me theres more to it than just the concussions tell me that please Every former player whos had his bell rung is probably asking the
