							Just as Peyton Manning prepares to lead the Denver Broncos into the Super Bowl one Colorado school district has barred kids from wearing the future Hall of Famer8217s jersey 8211 even though they are free to don rival Cam Newton8217s
Manning8217s No 18 could be used to show loyalty to the local 822018th Street Gang according to officials at GreeleyEvans School District 6 which operates 25 schools serving more than 21000 students That makes it one of six numbers identified by the distrcit as having potential gang associations
Gangs use those items of clothing for a few reasons school district spokeswoman Theresa Meyers told The Tribune of Greeley They use them to recruit and they use them to intimidate
Other numbers that can8217t be worn by students in the public district about an hour from the Broncos Mile High Stadium are 13 14 31 41 and 81
But the No 1 sported by Newton quarterback of Denver8217s Super Bowl foe the Carolina Panthers won8217t draw a flag
Manning has worn No 18 since his collegiate days at University of Tennessee and his jersey has been a big seller in Colorado since he became a Bronco in 2012
But even with the Broncos in Sundays NFL championship and schools around the state holding Broncos Days GreeleyEvans hasnt had to field any real complaints about its dress code
I think as time has gone on its just an expectation Meyers said  Now people are just like Thats the rule
