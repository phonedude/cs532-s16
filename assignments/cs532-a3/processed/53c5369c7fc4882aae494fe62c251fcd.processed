		The sequel to the 2010 Teach For America A Review of the Evidencewas released by theNational Education Policy Center NEPCtoday The new policy report is entitled Teach For America A Return to the Evidence I have included the citation official NEPC press release and the Executive Summary in this post
Citation Vasquez Heilig J amp Jez SJ 2014Teach For America A Return to the EvidenceBoulder CO National Education Policy Center Retrieved from httpnepccoloradoedupublicationteachforamericareturn
Press ReleaseA Return to the Evidence

Scholars conclude the program has some strengths but smart policy should focus on reforms
that create stability and with stronger track records for improving student achievement
BOULDER CO January 7 2014 8212 Teach For America TFA is almost a quartercentury old Since its launch the program has experienced phenomenal growth both in the numbers of participants and in the financial support it has received and it has enjoyed extensive favorable publicity
Teach For America A Return to the Evidence a report authored by professors Julian Vasquez Heilig of the University of Texas and Su Jin Jez of California State University Sacramento for the National Education Policy Center challenges the simplistic but widespread belief that TFA is a clearcut success story In fact Heilig and Jez find that the best evidence shows TFA participants as a group are not meaningfully or consistently improving educational outcomes for the children they have taught
Teach For America recruits college graduates typically from elite universities to serve in shortterm twoyear positions teaching in lowincome communities According to Heilig and Jez the program is a mixed bag with some benefits and some harms But they conclude it is hugely oversold and it risks being a distraction from alternative strategies for which research evidence provides much stronger support for improving teaching and educational outcomes especially for children living in poverty
Teach For America and other organizations have produced studies asserting benefits provided by TFA teachers Those studies however have only rarely undergone peer review  the standard benchmark for quality research Heilig and Jez observe In contrast the available peer reviewed research has produced a decidedly mixed picture For example the results attributed to TFA teachers varies both by their experience and certification level The results also fluctuate depending on the types of teachers to whom the TFA teachers are compared TFA teachers look relatively good when compared to other inexperienced poorly trained teachers but the results are more problematic when they are compared to fully prepared and experienced teachers Heilig and Jez report
Because of these differences the question most frequently askedAre TFA teachers as good as teachers who enter the profession through other routesis not the question we should be asking Heilig and Jez contend Whether one or the other group is better is a question that cannot be answered unless we first identify which TFA and nonTFA teachers were asking about they write
Even more important The lack of a statistically and practically significant impact should indicate to policymakers that TFA is likely not providing a meaningful reduction in disparities in educational outcomes notwithstanding its explosive growth and popularity in the media according to Heilig and Jez Moreover despite its rapid growth TFA remains a tiny fraction of the nations teaching corps for every TFA teacher there are 50000 other teachers in the US Heilig and Jez note and the small numbers and small impact of TFA point to a needed shift in thinking
We should be trying to dramatically improve the quality of teaching write Heilig and Jez It is time to shift our focus from a program of mixed impact that even if the benefits actually matched the rhetoric would not move the needle on Americas educational quality due to the fact that only 0002 of all teachers in the United States are Teach For America placements
The authors conclude with a series of recommendations For example they urge policymakers and school districts to invest in 8220evidencebased educational reforms and to undertake a detailed understanding of the peerreviewed research literature on the impact of new promising innovations
Heilig and Jez also offer recommendations specific to TFA They urge districts to support TFA staffing only when the alternative hiring pool consists of uncertified and emergency teachers or substitutes to require contractual fiveyear commitments from TFA teachers which would improve student testscore achievement and reduce teacher turnover to require TFA teachers  indeed all teachers  to obtain additional training based on wellsupported best practices for inservice teacher professional development and to better understand TFAs fiscal impact by comparing data such as finder fees placement and attrition rates for TFA teachers as well as the programs various costs by communities

For those of you that would like more information on the specific findings I have included the Executive Summary from the report below
Executive Summary
Teach For America TFA receives hundreds of millions of public and private dollars and has garnered acclaim for sending college graduates who do not typically have an education background to teach in lowincome rural and urban schools for a twoyear commitment The number of TFA corps members has grown by about 2000 since its inception in 1990 The impact of these transitory teachers is hotly debated Admirers see the program as a way to grow the supply of outstanding graduates albeit temporarily as teachers Critics however see the program as a diversion from truly beneficial policies or even as a harmful dalliance into the lives of lowincome students who most need a highly trained highly skilled and stable teacher workforce
Despite a series of nonpeerreviewed studies funded by TFA and other organizations that purport to show benefits of TFA teachers peerreviewed research on their impact continues to produce a mixed picture The peerreviewed research suggests that results are affected by the experience and certification level of the TFA teachers as well as by the group of teachers with whom those TFA teachers are compared The questions specifics strongly determine the answer
The practical question faced by most districts is whether TFA teachers do as well as or better than fully credentialed nonTFA teachers with whom those school districts aim to staff their schoolsOn this question the predominance of peerreviewed studies have indicated that on average the students of novice TFA teachers perform less well in reading and mathematics assessments than those of fully credentialed beginning teachers But the differences are small and the TFA teachers do better if compared with other lesstrained and inexperienced teachers Again the comparison group matters greatly
The lack of a statistically and practically significant impact should indicate to policymakers that TFA is likely not providing a meaningful reduction in disparities in educational outcomes notwithstanding its explosive growth and popularity in the media The program is best understood as a weak BandAid that sometimes provides some benefits but that is recurrently and systematically ripped away and replaced
Experience has a positive effect for both TFA and nonTFA teachers Most peerreviewed studies find that the relatively few TFA teachers who stay long enough to become fully credentialed typically after two years appear to do about as well as other similarly experienced fully credentialed teachers in teaching reading and sometimes do better than this comparison group in teaching mathematics However since more than 50 of TFA teachers leave after two years and more than 80 leave after three years it is impossible to know whether these more positive findings for experienced TFA recruits result from additional training and experience or from attrition of TFA teachers who are less effective

TFAs revenue has rapidly expanded Between 2000 and 2013 TFAs yearly operating expenditures increased 1930from 10 million to 1935 million Of those expenditures TFA annual reports show that about a third of operating costs are borne by the public Also over the past ten years TFA has obtained nearly a half of a billion dollars from private sources With an organization as large as TFA there is no perfect way to assign specific costs but dividing TFAs income reported in its 2011 annual report by the number of corps members yields a figure of approximately 25490 for each corps member recruited and placed About a third of this money comes from local state and federal budgets earmarked to support TFA as a perceived benefit to society Another third comes from taxdeductible charitable donations from individuals and corporations to TFA which is incorporated as a nonprofit And the final third comes from private foundations Including what TFA spends directly per recruit our calculations show that the total cost of the twoyear commitment from a TFA recruit can easily exceed 70000 when including professional development training and other costs
Due to the high turnover of TFA teachers the reoccurring costs of hiring 100 TFA recruits is quite high for societyabout 6044000 more than hiring 100 NonTFA teachers From a school and district perspective TFA is also expensive Recruiting and training replacements for teachers who constantly churn involves recurring financial costs Districts also pay TFA a fee per corps member per year employedresulting in a substantial ongoing expenditure
Thus despite hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and extensive lobbying by supporters and prominent alumni TFA appears to offer few if any benefits for improving teacher quality in hardtostaff schools Why then is there so much discussion even controversy surrounding TFA
Despite persistent claims to the contrary a simple answer to the question of the overall utility of TFA teachers for urban and rural schools is elusive The program is sometimes viewed by policymakers and advocates as a way to meaningfully address the very real need for highquality instruction in hardtostaff schoolsand it is clearly not that At best hiring TFA teachers is a stopgap measure for some desperate schools that is somewhat better than their other poor options But even in those cases the program is a diversion away from truly beneficial policies
Instead of trying to understand whether or not TFA teachers are as good as nonTFA teachers a question that cannot be answered unless we first identify which TFA and nonTFA teachers were asking about we propose a shift in thinking about the impact of TFA We should be trying to dramatically improve the quality of teaching It is time to shift our focus from a program of mixed impact that even if the benefits actually matched the rhetoric would not move the needle on Americas educational quality due to the fact that only 0002 of all teachers in the United States are Teach For America placements It is therefore recommended that policymakers and districts

Invest strategically in evidencebased educational reform options already incontrovertibly identified in the peerreviewed research literature as substantially improving student success by larger margins than the mixed evidence on TFA
Devote effort to understanding the peerreviewed research literature on the impact of new promising innovations

Based on the review of the evidence we make the following recommendations to districts in regards to hiring through TFA

Support TFA staffing only when the alternative hiring pool consists of uncertified and emergency teachers or substitutes
Consider the significant costs of TFA teachers estimated at over 70000 per recruit and press for contractual fiveyear commitments to improve student testscore achievement and reduce costly teacher turnover
If not already compulsory require TFA teachers to receive additional teacher training that is based on wellsupported best practices for inservice teacher professional development We recommend this for nonTFA teachers too but feel it is especially important for TFA teachers given their limited preservice training
Independently obtain contracts and data to compare by community finder fees placement and attrition rates of TFA teachers and various costs

Once the rhetoric is stripped the hype worn down and the two years finished what do we have Disruption without improvement TFA interns should stick to volunteering maybe Like with a master teacher with a minimum of five years8217 experience We know what works Why don8217t we celebrate skill and dedication instead of novelty for novelty8217s sake
