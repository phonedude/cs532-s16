With Martin OrsquoMalley finally out of the Democratic primary Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have spent much of the last week worrying over language Most of all theyrsquove been arguing about the meaning of the word progressive a term that each wants to claimmdashand that neither can agree on Ultimately those quibbles are probably just symptoms of their larger struggle a fight thatrsquos only gone more negative since the two candidatesrsquo close finish in the Iowa caucus early this week Will their long simmering tensions finally boil over during the debate Thursday night Or will they stay focused on the issues that really matter Either way wersquoll be following along throughout the evening keeping a running tally of Clinton and Sandersrsquo best lines





















Clinton on getting things done






I want to imagine a countrynbspwhere peoplersquos wages reflectnbsptheir hard work where we havenbsphealth care for everyone andnbspwhere every child gets to livenbspup to his or her potentialnbspIrsquom fighting for people whonbspcannot wait for those changesnbspand Im not making promises thatnbspI cannot keep
