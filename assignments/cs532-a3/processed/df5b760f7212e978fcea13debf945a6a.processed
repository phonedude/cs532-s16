If youre a football fan youre probably used to seeing ads for erectile dysfunction drugs And arthritis drugs And psoriasis drugs Televised NFL games are magnets for prescription drug ads
So it8217s curious that pharma companies tend not to play onthe biggest stage of all  the Super Bowl
There was just one pharma ad in last year8217s Super Bowl and so far none have been announced for this yearHere are three reasons why
The glare of the spotlight can be harsh
In the lighthearted atmosphere of the Super Bowl its an uphill battle to produce a successful ad about aserious health condition The fact that drug makers are required to rattle off a long list of potential side effects doesn8217t help either
Read moreThe untold story of TVs first prescription drug ad
Valeant Pharmaceuticalsmade a play for Super Bowl glorylast year with a quirky spotto promote its prescription antifungal cream Jublia In the animated ad ahelmetclad big toe raced across a football field to tackle toenail fungusItfell flat drawing scorn on social media 8220Nothing goes with Super Bowl chili con queso dip like a toenail fungus commercial8221 one viewer wrote
By contrast nobody is scrutinizing the advertising thats running on a typical Sunday afternoon football game said Timothy Calkins a marketing professor at Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management
Its expensive
Drug companies have plenty of cash to spend on advertising but the price for a single Super Bowl ad  now up to 5 million for a 30second spot  is likely to prompt even the most wealthy companies to consider cheaper alternatives to reach sports fans
Read moreAmerican Medical Association wants to ban drug ads to consumers
Among the alternatives Regular season NFL games In each of the last two seasons viewers watching these gameson network TV saw ads promoting anaverage of13 different prescription drugs according to the research firm Kantar Media Oftentimes they saw ahandful of drug ads during a single game
The audience is too diluted

The viewership for regular season football games tends to skew older and male  the target audience for a drug for say erectile dysfunction In factEli Lillys EDdrug Cialis was the most commonly advertised medication during these games according to Kantar Media
But the Super Bowl brings out the whole family
Youre talking millions and millions of people and you may only get a fraction of the audience you want said Chuck Thompson executive vice president of the Video Advertising Bureau a trade group for TV companies
So what will you see instead of pitches for Cialis
Lots of beer ads of course And lots and lots of ads for snacks
