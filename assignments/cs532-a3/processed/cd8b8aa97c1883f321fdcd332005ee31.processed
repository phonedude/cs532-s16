between the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos are displayed at the Race amp Sports SuperBook at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort amp Casino Ethan MillerGetty Images   By Adam Kilgore February 5  Follow adamkilgorewp    The fat man plowed over the goal line and across Las Vegas phones started ringing in the back offices of sports books One of them rang at the old MGM where Jimmy Vaccaro picked up the phone The panicked voice on the other end asked what bookmakers all over town wanted to know What the heck just happened What had started as a lark a goofy way to drum up business had led to widespread commiseration The books had offered bettors a chance to bet on William Refrigerator Perry scoring a touchdown in the 1986 Super Bowl the most exotic version of a proposition bet  a prop  offered to that point on the biggest sporting event in the country When Perry plunged into the end zone during the Chicago Bears blowout over the New England Patriots it stunned the oddsmakers and cost Vegas casinos vast sums What the heck really happened was this Perrys unlikely touchdown gave rise to a phenomenon that changed the way millions of Americans watch the Super Bowl Americans will wager 42 billion on Super Bowl 50 according to the American Gaming Associations projection and it would be a conservative estimate that 1 billion will be risked on props  bets pertaining to specific outcomes within and surrounding the game other than the actual score or total number of points Do you think the Denver Broncos will score exactly four points You can bet 100 on it at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook and win 999900 You can predict which player scores the first touchdown or whether Neymar will score more goals Sunday than Cam Newton scores touchdowns or how many receptions Carolina Panthers wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery will make You can bet at worse than 5050 odds on the coin toss   Everything you need to know about Super Bowl 50 in one place      William The Refrigerator Perry spikes the ball after scoring a touchdown that cost Vegas book makers dearly Amy SancettaAssociated Press  At the Westgate for one bettors can choose from more than 400 props including  this is real  whether the total points and rebounds on Sunday by Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins subtracted by 612  will be less or more than Broncos tight end Owen Danielss receiving yards Offshore and online sports books not held to the same regulation standards as the Vegas casinos offer odds on how long the national anthem will last what color the Gatorade dumped over the winning coach will be and which song Coldplay will play first at halftime Now Wynn sports book director Johnny Avello said its just grown into a monster I was sweating bullets This years Super Bowl will mark the 30year anniversary of when the madness began to escalate Entering Super Bowl XX proposition wagers were really an unknown commodity said Station Casinos Vice President Art Manteris who ran the Caesars sports book in the mid1980s Sports books offered a handful for big games simple stuff such as the result at the end of each quarter Manteris wanted a way to attract more casual fans to his sports book The Bears were fashionable a team that went 151 during the regular season with players who taunted the commissioner and danced the Super Bowl Shuffle No player was more lovably popular than Perry a mammoth rookie defensive tackle whose gaptoothed smile had appeared in commercials and on David Letterman Perry had scored twice in the season as a goalline fullback which only added to his aura Manteris believed a bet involving Perry would appeal to average fans His assistant and close friend Chuck Esposito assured him Bears Coach Mike Ditka would never risk a defensive lineman fumbling in the Super Bowl and anyway Perry hadnt rushed the ball in nearly two months Manteris set the line at 201 for every dollar someone bet theyd win 20 if Perry scored a touchdown Vaccaro now the director at South Point Casino put up the same line an hour later at MGM Me and Manteris we still wrestle over that said Vaccaro who defers to Manteris as the progenitor even though Im older The ploy worked Bettors poured into the sports book to bet on The Fridge scoring a touchdown Other sports books copied the prop The Associated Press picked up the story and newspaper reporters from Chicago started calling Vegas As bets come in bookmakers adjust the odds to mitigate their risk So many people flocked to Manteriss prop that by kickoff the odds had fallen to 21 The Refrigerator prop got so much attention Manteris said The PR department had so much fun with it   A betting sheet for Super Bowl 50 between the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos is displayed at the Race amp Sports SuperBook at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort amp Casino Ethan MillerGetty Images    Super Bowl gambling guide Point spread prop bets ATS trends   For Manteris and his cohorts the fun stopped late in the third quarter With the Bears leading 373 and at the 1yard line Ditka sent Perry into the backfield The sports book erupted when Perry rumbled into the end zone everyone elated except the bookmakers in the back offices I remember it like it was yesterday Manteris said I was sitting in the office with Chucky Esposito I wasnt real happy He had assured me a million times Hell never carry the ball  Vaccaro said his sports book lost 48000 on the touchdown but Art won the prize that day Manteris would not reveal the precise figure but said he lost well into six figures The next day Manteris received a call from the chairman of the casino I was sweating bullets Manteris said I thought he was calling to ask how we could lose so much money on a stupid prop Instead the chairman congratulated Manteris on the attention the wager had brought the casino The Fridge Prop had paid for itself in publicity It was the best money ever spent by the sports books in Las Vegas Vaccaro said We knew we had something The popularity of the Perry prop made bookmakers realize what a huge draw they could be In 1989 a young bookmaker named Jay Kornegay opened the sports book at the Imperial Palace and pushed them further By then most sports books offered around 25 props For the 1990 Super Bowl Kornegay who now runs the Westgate book proved he could branch outside football to create a Super Bowl prop bet Who would score more the San Francisco 49ers or Michael Jordan Joe Montanas 49ers cashed 5539 A string of Super Bowl blowouts in the early 90s lessened betting interest on the game so Kornegay offered more props In 1995 when the 49ers were a 1912 point favorite over the San Diego Chargers Kornegay tripled his books menu to roughly 150 props with a focus on results that wouldnt be decided until late in the game From that point on we knew we had something Kornegay said Everybody warmed up to it   The five makeorbreak factors that will decide Super Bowl 50   Props have only grown in diversity and popularity Manteris believes the rise of fantasy sports which conditioned fans to calibrate individual stats pushed more casual bettors toward props The prevalence of online sports books pushed the Vegas casinos to expand their prop menus but only to a point State regulations prohibit casinos from taking bets on action that can be known ahead of time or is voted upon although the gaming commission is starting to relax its standards For this time this year Vegas casinos can take bets on who will win the MVP Cam Newton is the favorite at 57 odds As those props piled up so too did the war stories In 2007 a frequent highstakes gambler at Manteriss casino wanted to bet above the typical limit that Chicagos Devin Hester would score the games first touchdown against the Indianapolis Colts Manteris assented The opening kickoff of the game goes to Hester he takes it back 92 yards and scores the first touchdown Manteris said I look at some of my guys and go Holy smokes were nine seconds into the game and were stuck 100000   7 Super Bowl prop bets that provide value  If you like the look of ashen faces mention Super Bowl safeties to a Vegas bookmaker In 2012 the New England Patriots took possession on their own 6 in a scoreless contest Tom Brady backed into his own end zone rifled a pass out of bounds and got called for intentional grounding an automatic safety Not only did those holding a ticket betting yes on the question of will there be a safety cash in but so did those who wagered on the first score being a safety  at 1001 odds The books got clobbered and the result encouraged bettors to bet on the safety next year As the Baltimore Ravens protected a fivepoint lead in the shadow of their end zone they took an intentional safety which meant more winning tickets for those who bet on any safety or a safety on the final score Lightning struck again in 2014 when the first snap of the game flew over Peyton Mannings head and rolled into the end zone Another firstscore safety and another beating for the books Safeties they can eliminate that as far as Im concerned for the Super Bowl Avello said When a guy gets sacked in the end zone just make it worth six points Theres no algorithms Some lines are easy to determine At South Point Vaccaro has taken 30000 in bets on three props he posted the day after last years Super Bowl whether there will be a twopoint conversion whether there will be overtime and the coin toss The bets came in small amounts none larger than 50 from tourists who wanted to know theyd have a little action on the big game Others take more time At the Wynn Avello orders an Italian feast for his team of six at 5 pm on the Thursday after the conference title games and they stay up all night until theyre finished They scour statistics from the year study how the teams fared against common or similar opponents and try to gauge public perception Theres no algorithms that need to be done Avello said Avello checks and doublechecks the language By Saturday afternoon the full menu is ready for the public It wears me out Avello said Wednesday afternoon Im just starting to come around Its almost like I had a head cold for four days Thirty years after Perrys touchdown captured the publics eye props are more popular than ever Kornegay expects 60 percent of the Westgates Super Bowl handle  the amount of money bet  to be on props Bookmakers are still seeking creative means to let customers bet on the games biggest stars Vaccaro created a prop asking whether Manning will finish the game The line for yes is 400 and no opened at 300 Its perfect really the games biggest story line and a bet that could come down to the final whistle no matter the result of you know the game Every year Vaccaro said someone somewhere comes up with something neat   Adam Kilgore covers national sports for the Washington Post Previously he served as the Posts Washington Nationals beat writer from 2010 to 2014      sports redskins
