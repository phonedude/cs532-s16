        Last year was a busy one for public giveaways to the National Football League In Virginia Republican Governor Bob McDonnell who styles himself as a budgetslashing conservative crusader took 4million from taxpayers pockets and handed the money to the Washington Redskins for the team to upgrade a workout facility Hoping to avoid scrutiny McDonnell approved the gift while the state legislature was out of session The Redskins owner Dan Snyder has a net worth estimated by Forbes at 1billion But even billionaires like to receive expensive giftsTaxpayers in Hamilton County Ohio which includes Cincinnati were hit with a bill for 26 million in debt service for the stadiums where the NFLs Bengals and Major League Baseballs Reds play plus another 7million to cover the direct operating costs for the Bengals field Prosports subsidies exceeded the 236million that the county cut from healthandhumanservices spending in the current twoyear budget and represent a sizable chunk of the 119million cut from Hamilton County schools Press materials distributed by the Bengals declare that the team gives back about 1million annually to Ohio community groups Sound generous Thats about 4percent of the public subsidy the Bengals receive annually from Ohio taxpayersIn Minnesota the Vikings wanted a new stadium and were vaguely threatening to decamp to another state if they didnt get it The Minnesota legislature facing a 11billion budget deficit extracted 506million from taxpayers as a gift to the team covering roughly half the cost of the new facility Some legislators argued that the Vikings should reveal their finances privately held the team is not required to disclose operating data despite the public subsidies it receives In the end the Minnesota legislature folded giving away public money without the Vikings disclosing information in return The teams principal owner Zygmunt Wilf had a 2011 net worth estimated at 322million with the new stadium deal the Vikings value rose about 200million by Forbess estimate further enriching Wilf and his family They will make a token annual payment of 13million to use the stadium keeping the lions share of all NFL ticket concession parking and most important television revenuesAfter approving the 506 million handout Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said Im not one to defend the economics of professional sports Any deal you make in that world doesnt make sense from the way the rest of us look at it Even by the standards of political pandering Daytons irresponsibility was breathtakingIn California the City of Santa Clara broke ground on a 13billion stadium for the 49ers Officially the deal includes 116million in public funding with private capital making up the rest At least thats the way the deal was announced A new government entity the Santa Clara Stadium Authority is borrowing 950million largely from a consortium led by Goldman Sachs to provide the majority of the private financing Who are the board members of the Santa Clara Stadium Authority The members of the Santa Clara City Council In effect the city of Santa Clara is providing most of the private funding Should something go wrong taxpayers will likely take the hitThe 49ers will pay Santa Clara 245 million annually in rent for four decades which makes the deal from the teams standpoint a 40year loan amortized at less than 1percent interest At the time of the agreement 30year Treasury bonds were selling for 3percent meaning the Santa Clara contract values the NFL as a better risk than the United States governmentAlthough most of the capital for the new stadium is being underwritten by the public most football revenue generated within the facility will be pocketed by Denise DeBartolo York whose net worth is estimated at 11billion and members of her family York took control of the team in 2000 from her brother Edward DeBartolo Jr after he pleaded guilty to concealing an extortion plot by a former governor of Louisiana Brother and sister inherited their money from their father Edward DeBartoloSr a shoppingmall developer who became one of the nations richest men before his death in 1994 A generation ago the DeBartolos made their money the oldfashioned way by hard work in the free market Today the familys wealth rests on political influence and California tax subsidies Nearly all NFL franchises are familyowned converting public subsidies and tax favors into high living for a modernday feudal eliteProfootball coaches talk about accountability and selfreliance yet profootball owners routinely binge on giveaways and handouts A year after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the Saints resumed hosting NFL games justifiably a national feelgood story The finances were another matter Taxpayers have in stages provided about 1billion to build and later renovate what is now known as the MercedesBenz Superdome All monetary figures in this article have been converted to 2013 dollars The Saints owner Tom Benson whose net worth Forbes estimates at 12billion keeps nearly all revenue from ticket sales concessions parking and broadcast rights Taxpayers even footed the bill for the addition of leather stadium seats with cup holders to cradle the drinks they are charged for at concession stands And corporate welfare for the Saints doesnt stop at stadium construction and renovation costs Though Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal claims to be an antispending conservative each year the state of Louisiana forcibly extracts up to 6million from its residents pockets and gives the cash to Benson as an inducement paymentthe actual term usedto keep Benson from developing a wandering eyeTwelve teams have turned a profit on stadium subsidies alonereceiving more money than they needed to build their facilitiesIn NFL city after NFL city this pattern is repeated CenturyLink Field where the Seattle Seahawks play opened in 2002 with Washington State taxpayers providing 390million of the 560million construction cost The Seahawks owned by Paul Allen one of the richest people in the world pay the state about 1million annually in rent in return for most of the revenue from ticket sales concessions parking and broadcasting all told perhaps 200million a year Average people are taxed to fund Allens privatejet lifestyleThe Pittsburgh Steelers winners of six Super Bowls the most of any franchise play at Heinz Field a glorious stadium that opens to a view of the serenely flowing Ohio and Allegheny Rivers Pennsylvania taxpayers contributed about 260million to help build Heinz Fieldand to retire debt from the Steelers previous stadium Most gameday revenues including television fees go to the Rooney family the majority owner of the team The teams owners also kept the 75million that Heinz paid to name the facilityJudith Grant Long a Harvard University professor of urban planning calculates that leaguewide 70percent of the capital cost of NFL stadiums has been provided by taxpayers not NFL owners Many cities counties and states also pay the stadiums ongoing costs by providing power sewer services other infrastructure and stadium improvements When ongoing costs are added Longs research finds the Buffalo Bills Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns Houston Texans Indianapolis Colts Jacksonville Jaguars Kansas City Chiefs New Orleans Saints San Diego Chargers St Louis Rams Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tennessee Titans have turned a profit on stadium subsidies alonereceiving more money from the public than they needed to build their facilities Longs estimates show that just three NFL franchisesthe New England Patriots New York Giants and New York Jetshave paid threequarters or more of their stadium capital costsMany NFL teams have also cut sweetheart deals to avoid taxes The futuristic new field where the Dallas Cowboys play with its 80000 seats gogo dancers on upper decks and builtin nightclubs has been appraised at nearly 1billion At the basic propertytax rate of Arlington Texas where the stadium is located Cowboys owner Jerry Jones would owe at least 6million a year in property taxes Instead he receives no propertytax bill so Tarrant County taxes the property of average people more than it otherwise wouldIn his office at 345 Park Avenue in Manhattan NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell must smile when Texas exempts the Cowboys stadium from taxes or the governor of Minnesota bows low to kiss the feet of the NFL The National Football League is about two things producing highquality sports entertainment which it does very well and exploiting taxpayers which it also does very well Goodell should knowhis pay about 30million in 2011 flows from an organization that does not pay corporate taxesThats rightextremely profitable and one of the most subsidized organizations in American history the NFL also enjoys taxexempt status On paper it is the Nonprofit Football LeagueThis situation came into being in the 1960s when Congress granted antitrust waivers to what were then the National Football League and the American Football League allowing them to merge conduct a common draft and jointly auction television rights The merger was good for the sport stabilizing pro football while ensuring quality of competition But Congress gave away the store to the NFL while getting almost nothing for the public in returnThe 1961 Sports Broadcasting Act was the first piece of giftwrapped legislation granting the leagues legal permission to conduct televisionbroadcast negotiations in a way that otherwise would have been price collusion Then in 1966 Congress enacted Public Law 89800 which broadened the limited antitrust exemptions of the 1961 law Essentially the 1966 statute said that if the two profootball leagues of that era mergedthey would complete such a merger four years later forming the current NFLthe new entity could act as a monopoly regarding television rights Apple or ExxonMobil can only dream of legal permission to function as a monopoly the 1966 law was effectively a license for NFL owners to print money Yet this sweetheart deal was offered to the NFL in exchange only for its promise not to schedule games on Friday nights or Saturdays in autumn when many high schools and colleges play footballPublic Law 89800 had no nameunlike say the catchy USA Patriot Act or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Congress presumably wanted the bill to be lowprofile given that its effect was to increase NFL owners wealth at the expense of average peopleWhile Public Law 89800 was being negotiated with congressional leaders NFL lobbyists tossed in the sort of obscure provision that is the essence of the lobbyists art The phrase or professional football leagues was added to Section501c6 of 26USC the Internal Revenue Code Previously a sentence in Section501c6 had granted notforprofit status to business leagues chambers of commerce realestate boards or boards of trade Since 1966 the code has read business leagues chambers of commerce realestate boards boards of trade or professional football leaguesThe insertion of professional football leagues into the definition of notforprofit organizations was a transparent sellout of public interest This decision has saved the NFL uncounted millions in tax obligations which means that ordinary people must pay higher taxes public spending must decline or the national debt must increase to make up for the shortfall Nonprofit status applies to the NFLs headquarters which administers the league and its allimportant television contracts Individual teams are forprofit and presumably pay income taxesthough because all except the Green Bay Packers are privately held and do not disclose their finances its impossible to be sureFor Veterans Day last year the NFL announced that it would donate cash to military groups for each point scored in designated games During NFL telecasts that weekend the league was praised for its grand generosity The total donation came to about 440000 Annualized NFL stadium subsidies and tax favors add up to perhaps 1billion So the NFL took 1billion from the public then sought praise for giving back 440000less than a tenth of 1percentIn the NFL cynicism about public money starts at the top State laws and IRS rules generally forbid the use of nonprofit status as a subterfuge for personal enrichment Yet according to the leagues annual Form 990 in 2011 the most recent year for which numbers are available the NFL paid a total of almost 60million to its leading five executivesRoger Goodells windfall has been justified on the grounds that the free market rewards executives whose organizations perform well and there is no doubt that the NFL performs well as to both product qualitythe games are consistently terrificand the bottom line But almost nothing about the leagues operations involves the free market Taxpayers fund most stadium costs the league itself is taxexempt television images made in those publicly funded stadiums are privatized with all gains kept by the owners and then the entire organization is walled off behind a moat of antitrust exemptionsThe reason NFL executives pay is known is that in 2008 the IRS moved to strengthen the requirement that 501c6 organizations disclose payments to top officers The NFL asked Congress to grant pro football a waiver from the disclosure rule During the lobbying battle Joe Browne then the leagues vice president for public affairs told The New York Times I finally get to the point where Im making 150 grand and they want to put my name and address on the disclosure form so the lawyer next door who makes a million dollars a year can laugh at me Browne added that 150000 does not buy in the New York area what it would in Dubuque Iowa The waiver was denied Left no option the NFL revealed that at the time Browne made about 2million annuallyPerhaps it is spitting into the wind to ask those who run the National Football League to show a sense of decency regarding the lucrative public trust they hold Goodells taking some 30million from an enterprise made more profitable because it hides behind its taxexempt status does not seem materially different from say the Fannie Mae CEOs taking a gigantic bonus while taxpayers were bailing out his companyPerhaps it is spitting into the wind to expect a son to be half what his father was Charles Goodell a member of the House of Representatives for New York from 1959 to 1968 and then a senator until 1971 was renowned as a man of conscienceamong the first members of Congress to oppose the Vietnam War one of the first Republicans to fight for environmental protection My initial experience with politics was knocking on doors for Charles Goodell a brownandwhite Senator Goodell campaign button sits in my mementos case Were Charles Goodell around today what would he think of his sons cupidity Roger Goodell has become the sort of person his father once opposedan insider who profits from his position while average people payI wanted to put questions about the NFLs finances to Roger Goodell When I was researching my book The King of Sports from which this excerpt is drawn I requested interview time with Goodell and he agreed When NFL headquarters learned that my questions would cover tax exemptions and health issues in the league the interview was promptly canceled League spokesman Greg Aiello told me it was not in the NFLs best interests to discuss safety or subsidiesOne might suppose that with football raking in such phenomenal sums of cash politicians could win votes by assuming populist stances regarding NFL subsidies and exemptions Instead in almost every instance Congress and state legislatures have rolled over and played dead for pro football NFL owners pressure local politicians with veiled threats of moving teams though no franchise has moved since 1998 Public officials who back footballstadium spending meanwhile can make lavish if unrealistic promises of jobs and tourism knowing the invoices wont come due until after they have left officeRoger Goodell has become the sort of person his father once opposedan insider who profits from his position while average people payPoliticians seem more interested in receiving campaign donations and invitations to luxury boxes than in taking on the football powers that be to bargain for a fair deal for ordinary people Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania a moderate who served 30 years in the Senate tried to pressure the NFL to stop picking the publics pocket but left Capitol Hill in 2011 and passed away the next year No populist champion so far has replaced him Specter told me in 2007 The NFL owners are arrogant people who have abused the public trust and act like they can get away with anythingToo often NFL owners can in fact get away with anything In financial terms the most important way they do so is by creating game images in publicly funded stadiums broadcasting the images over public airwaves and then keeping all the money they receive as a result Football fans know the warning intoned during each NFL contest that use of the games images without the NFLs consent is prohibited Under copyright law entertainment created in publicly funded stadiums is private propertyWhen for example Fox broadcasts a Tampa Bay Buccaneers game from Raymond James Stadium built entirely at the publics expense it has purchased the right to do so from the NFL In a typical arrangement taxpayers provide most or all of the funds to build an NFL stadium The team pays the local stadium authority a modest rent retaining the exclusive right to license images on game days The team then sells the right to air the games Finally the NFL asserts a copyright over what is broadcast No federal or state law prevents images generated in facilities built at public expense from being privatized in this mannerBaseball basketball ice hockey and other sports also benefit from this same process But the fact that others take advantage of the public too is no justification The NFLs sweetheart deal is by far the most valuable This year CBS DirecTV ESPN Fox NBC and Verizon will pay the NFL about 4billion for the rights to broadcast its games Next year that figure will rise to more than 6billion Because football is so popular its broadcast fees would be high no matter how the financial details were structured The fact that game images created in places built and operated at public expense can be privatized by the NFL inflates the amounts kept by NFL owners executives coaches and players while driving up the cable fees paid by people who may not even care to watch the gamesIn too many areas of contemporary life public subsidies are converted to private profit Sometimes such as with the bailout of General Motors once the subsidies end society is better off sometimes as with the bailout of AIG subsidies are repaid Public handouts for modern professional football never end and are never repaid In return the NFL creates nothing of social valuewhile setting bad examples despite its protests to the contrary regarding concussions painkiller misuse weight gain and cheating among other issues The No 1 sport in a nation with a childhoodobesity epidemic celebrates weight gain thats bad enough Worse the sport setting the bad example is subsidized up one side and down the otherThe NFLs nonprofit status should be revoked And lawmakersideally in Congress to level the national playing field as it wereshould require that television images created in publicly funded sports facilities cannot be privatized The devil would be in the details of any such action But Congress regulates health care airspace and other farmorecomplex aspects of contemporary life it can crack the whip on the NFLIf football images created in places funded by taxpayers became public domain the league would respond by paying the true cost of future stadiumswhile negotiating to repay construction subsidies already received To do otherwise would mean the loss of billions in televisionrights fees Pro football would remain just as exciting and popular but would no longer take advantage of average peopleIn 2010 the National Football League moved its annual Pro Bowl away from Honolulu for the first time in 30 years At the very time Hawaii was cutting its budget for public schools state lawmakers voted to pay the NFL 4million per game to bring the event back to their capital The lawmakers giftgiving was bad enough What was disgraceful was that the rich subsidized owners of the NFL acceptedUntil public attitudes change those at the top of the profootball pyramid will keep getting away with whatever they can This is troubling not just because ordinary people are taxed so a small number of NFL owners and officers can live as modern feudal lords and ladies It is troubling because athletics are supposed to set an exampleand the example being set by the NFL is one of selfishnessFootball is the king of sports Should the favorite sport of the greatest nation really be one whose economic structure is based on inequality and greed

        The passing of Antonin Scalia roils the presidential campaign and could leave the Supreme Court deadlocked until 2017 Will the Senate even consider a replacement nominated by President Obama
        
        
            The sudden death of Antonin Scalia an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on Saturday morning will shake up American politics like few events in recent memory reshaping the 2016 presidential campaign and potentially leaving the Supreme Court deadlocked for more than a year13

In the short term President Obama will have to decide who to nominate to replace the voluble conservative jurist and the Republicanled Senate will have to decide whether to even consider the presidentx2019s pick in the heat of the election campaign Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately signaled that an Obama nominee would not get a vote this year x201CThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justicex201D the Kentucky Republican said in a statement x201CTherefore this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new presidentx201D CNN reported Saturday evening that Obama intends to nominate a new Supreme Court justice setting up a potential confrontation with Republicans that would play out both on xA0Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail13

        The number of American teens who excel at advanced math has surged Why 
        
        
            On a sultry evening last July a tall softspoken 17yearold named David Stoner and nearly 600 other math whizzes from all over the world sat huddled in small groups around wicker bistro tables talking in low voices and obsessively refreshing the browsers on their laptops The air in the cavernous lobby of the Lotus Hotel Pang Suan Kaew in Chiang Mai Thailand was humid recalls Stoner whose light South Carolina accent warms his carefully chosen words The tension in the room made it seem especially heavy like the atmosphere at a highstakes poker tournament13

Stoner and five teammates were representing the United States in the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad They figured theyx2019d done pretty well over the two days of competition God knows theyx2019d trained hard Stoner like his teammates had endured a grueling regime for more than a yearx2014practicing tricky problems over breakfast before school and taking on more problems late into the evening after he completed the homework for his collegelevel math classes Sometimes he sketched out proofs on the large dryerase board his dad had installed in his bedroom Most nights he put himself to sleep reading books like New Problems in Euclidean Geometry and An Introduction to Diophantine Equations13

        Does his faith influence his judicial decision making
        
        
            March was a hugely important month for religion and the Supreme Court and a pivotal moment for Justice Antonin Scalia the subject of a fat new biography Too bad we couldnx2019t talk plainly about what was and is at stake In a country historically averse to political debates about competing faiths nowhere is frank discussion of religion more taboo than at the US Supreme Court x201CReligion is the third rail of Supreme Court politics Itx2019s not something thatx2019s talked about in polite companyx201D as Jeff Shesol the author of a book about the New Deal Court put it He was speaking with NPRx2019s Nina Totenberg in 2010 when John Paul Stevens was looking at retirement and for the first time in American history there was the prospect of six Catholics three Jews and no Protestants on the highest court in the landx2014a watershed almost too x201Cradioactivex201D Totenberg remarked even to note And beware of venturing any further than that as the University of Chicago Law Schoolx2019s Geoffrey Stone did in a controversial 2007 blog post suggesting that the Supreme Courtx2019s five conservatives likely derived their abortion views from Catholic doctrine Scaliax2014a devout Catholic and the current Courtx2019s longestserving conservativex2014announced a boycott of the school until Stone leaves the faculty13

            After decades of anticipation we have directly detected gravitational wavesx2014ripples in spacetime traveling at the speed of light through the universe Scientists at LIGO the Laser Interferometic Gravitationalwave Observatory have announced that they have measured waves coming from the inspiral of two massive black holes providing a spectacular confirmation of Albert Einsteinx2019s general theory of relativity whose hundredth anniversary was celebrated just last year13
13
Finding gravitational waves indicates that Einstein was once again right and opens a new window onto energetic events occurring around the universe But therex2019s a deeper lesson as well a reminder of the central importance of locality an idea that underlies much of modern physics13

Coming from Planet Android I wasnx2019t as put off by the larger dimensions as everyone else in the technosphere seemed to be But I was as usual put off by one thing that both the Apple product and its archnemesis from Google shared the unpocketability of the phone particularly by females13
13
This isnx2019t a new problem for women Our skinny jeans have pockets but there is no way an object bigger than a standard issue ID card fits in the front and everyone knows that slipping a phone in your back pocket is an invitation for a treacherous dive into a toilet or a backflip resulting in heartbreaking shatters Purses have enclosures that were once suitable for the flip phone generation but have since become too snug for newer models Throwing it into the main compartment seems risky at best13

            As it stands the international coalition is far from winning the information war against the Islamic State Its air strikes may be squeezing the group in Iraq and Syria and killing many of its leaders but that has not halted the selfproclaimed caliphatex2019s ideological momentum Indeed at the end of 2015 it was estimated that the number of foreigners travelling to join militant groups in Iraq and Syriax2014predominantly the Islamic Statex2014had more than doubled in the course of just 18 months Whatx2019s more while these figures may be striking sheer numbers are less important than intent when it comes to the organizationx2019s actual threat to the world As we have already seen it takes a very small number of people to unleash great terror whether in Iraq Syria or elsewhere13

            You donx2019t need to go to the theater to get the full experience of Zoolander 2 Simply get your hands on a copy of the original watch it and then yell a bunch of unfunny topical lines every time somebody tells a joke Thatx2019s how it feels to watch Ben Stillerx2019s sequel to his 2001 spoof of the fashion industry Zoolander 2 takes pains to reference every successful gag you remember from the original and then embellish them in painfulx2014often offensive almost always outdatedx2014fashion Itx2019s a film that has no real reason to exist and it spends its entire running time reaffirming that fact13

The original Zoolander to be fair had no business being as funny as it wasx2014it made fun of an industry that already seems to exist in a constant state of selfparody and much of its humor relied on simple malapropisms and sight gags But it was hilarious anyway as a candid snapshot of the fizzlingout of x201990s culture Like almost any zeitgeist comedy it belonged to a particular momentx2014and boy should it have stayed there With Zoolander 2 Stiller who directed cowrote and stars tries to recapture the magic of 2001 by referencing its past glories with increasing desperation perhaps to avoid the fact that he has nothing new to say about the fashion industry or celebrity culture 15 years laters13

Many people in this world would find my behavior rather strange Thatx2019s because Americans are exceptionally promiscuous when it comes to professing their love In the United States x201CI love youx201D is at once exalted and devalued It can mean everything  or nothing at all This is not universally the case13
