world might be conspiring to give Peyton Manning his second Super Bowl ring but according to one increasingly trustworthy source Cam Newton will steal the show at Super Bowl 50So says Madden NFL 16 at least For the 13th straight year EA Sports has simulated the big game using the latest version of its football video game franchise and the results are in Despite a spirited performance by old man Manning the Panthers will beat the Broncos 2420 to cap off their impressive season and bring the Vince Lombardi trophy to Charlotte for the first timeEAs simulation this year run on an Xbox One pits the computer against itself on the AllMadden difficulty setting using freshly updated rosters and stats Madden NFL 16nbspproduced a dramatic game punctuated by each team scoring in bunches and stepping up big defensively Roll the highlightsThe Panthers went ahead early Dangerous kick returner Ted Ginn Jr did his thing with a huge runback setting up a Cam Newton to Greg Olsen touchdown pass Shutting down Denvers offense Carolina added a field goal then poured it on when running back Jonathan Stewart rumbled into the end zone for another touchdown to end the halfDown 170 Manning started puling the Broncos together for what was shaping up to be an alltime comeback A TD toss to Emanuel Sanders two field goals and Denvers stout defense turned the shutout into a 1713 contest to end the third Manning started the final quarter with another touchdown pass this time to Demaryius Thomas to make it 20 unanswered pointsTrailing 2017 the Panthers would look to their own Pro Bowl QB for some lastminute heroics Late in the fourth Newton led the Panthers downfield and called his own number for a goal line TD rush Mannings lastditch effort to steal victory from the jaws of defeat ended unceremoniously and perhaps symbolically the clock simply ran out on the future Hall of FamerRelated Review Energetic Madden NFL 16 Airs It Out Hauls It InNewtons performance nbsp 19 of 26 for 216 yards with one TD and one interception  was good enough to earn him the Super Bowl MVP Running back Jonathan Stewart scurried for 47 yards and a TD while tight end Greg Olsen caught Newtons only TD pass and tallied 79 total receiving yards Cornerback Josh Norman came up huge defensively with six tackles and a big interceptionManning had a pretty good game too racking up 241 yards two TDs and one interception on 21 of 37 passes Six of those went to Thomas who turned them into 98 yards and one TD Mannings other TD was one of five caught by Sanders for 65 yards Denver cornerback Aqib Talib nearly matched Josh Norman with five tackles and a pickIf rattling off these stats seems absurd you didnt pay attention to last years eerily accurate Madden prediction Not only did Madden NFL 15 correctly pick the winner Patriots and final score 2824 it nailed Tom Bradys touchdown tosses 4 was just 27 yards off his passing yards 355 to 328 and was an astonishing three yards and one catch away from perfectly calling wide receiver Julian Edelmans entire game Thats bananasAnd that wasnt a total anomaly In 2009 Madden was just one point off the final score of Super Bowl XLIII and predicted the exact yardage of Steelers receiver Santonio Holmes When Madden hits it hits like a busBut it misses too and occasionally its worse than your average bar drunk In 2014 for instance Madden lost its mind and picked the Broncos over the Seahawks by three The final score Seahawks 43 Broncos 8 The company made up for it by sticking Richard Sherman on the cover of the following years game at leastBy and
