    Were here today to talk about a pretty important topic and that is Super Bowl recipes food dips desserts or whatever else it is youre making for your party this weekend Ive been plotting out my Sunday food strategy and I have plenty of ideas
Im likely going to make my own chicken wings on Sunday afternoon before the game I will be making two packages about 40 small wings or 20 large wings Decision 2016 I use the recipe below I also think that Franks Red Hot sauce is the best for chicken wings

  
  
    
  


Mrs Arrowhead Pride is throwing a beef roast into the crockpot earlier on Sunday so that will be cooking away all day long I am often in charge of this so its been thawed and I just find a bunch of spices to throw in there Chili powder salt pepper garlic and onion powder  throw it all in there and let that baby cook all day Once it comes out well have some tortillas pro tip hard shell inside of a soft shell as well as some chopped onions lettuce cheese and other sides for tacos
I am also deciding on which chips I will be eating all day The likely choice is the regular bag of Art and Marys The jalapeno version is great but it gets so hot that the only thing that makes it better is more jalapeno chips and then all of a sudden the whole bag is gone by noon Regular Art and Marys chips it is
Now that we have my plan out of the way heres how I do my wings Also see some more links below Please share your best ones for the rest of us
Preparing the rub
Put your wings in a bag or some sort of bowl you can cover Combine these spices together Put the spices in with the wings and coat the wings Let them sit for an hour or more If you are concerned about how hot these will be you can just slow down on the pepper
Pepper two tablespoonsOnion powder one tablespoonChili powder one tablespoonGarlic powder one tablespoonSeasoned salt one tablespoon

  
  
    
  


Cooking the wings
Youve got your wings that have been sitting in the rub for a while now If you keep the wings in the fridge take them out and let them sit for a few minutes in room temperature The key to the wings is smoking them If you have a smoker you probably know how to handle this If you dont you can just put them onnbspindirect heat on your grill and it will have a similar effect Smoke them for 2530 minutes on one side flip them and smoke them for another 2530 minutes on the other side
You can cook these however you want really Put them in the oven Throw them on the grill Just cook the way thats easiest for you
Preparing the sauce
While your wings are cooking youll make the sauce Take these three ingredients and put them together in a sauce pan and heat them up If that seems like a lot of honey for you feel free to cut back a little bit on that one cup Im from Kansas City so the type of barbecue sauce I use is a big thing Just pick out whatever your favorite barbecue sauce is and use that After you have cooked the wings on either side bring them in and throw this sauce on them and mix it up
Honey one cupBarbecue sauce half cupApple juice three tablespoons
Getting the crispy skin
I like my wings to have a slightly crispy skin So after youve smoked them on either side and put the sauce on them I like to throw them back on the grill over more direct heat for a few minutes to get that crispy skin Watch them carefully because they can burn quickly
