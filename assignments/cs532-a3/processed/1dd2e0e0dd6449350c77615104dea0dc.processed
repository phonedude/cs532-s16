Tips


Do not add sour cream or mayonnaise to the mix  this only dilutes the avocado flavor
Never make guacamole in advance Avocado discolors quickly on contact with air You can mix up the first ingredients a few hours in advance if you like but wait to add the avocado and later ingredients until just before serving
Put the pit in the bowl It will keep the guacamole fresh
Start with one small serrano then test for hotness If you like your guacamole fiery add more If fresh serrano chiles are not available in your area you can substitute fresh jalapenos but the flavor will be slightly different




	



	






Warnings


After cutting up any fresh chiles scrub hands very well Chile oils can cling to your fingers for some time Be careful not to rub your eyes after handling fresh chiles even after washing with soap and water And please mothers do not touch your babies until you know for sure that you will not hurt them  touch you finger to your eye if you must
