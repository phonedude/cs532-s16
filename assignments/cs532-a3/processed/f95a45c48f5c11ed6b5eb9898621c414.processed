Teach for America alumni flooded the Walter E Washington Convention Center on Saturday to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the organization which is known for placing striving idealistic and inexperienced teachers in some of the nations neediest schools The DC conference featured hundreds of speakers including some of the most prominent names in education reform such as acting US education secretary John King former New York City schools chief Joel Klein DC Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson and her predecessor Michelle Rhee Also on the agenda was a panel of speakers including Randi Weingarten president of the American Federation of Teachers and a frequent TFA critic The TFA  lauded for attracting highachieving college graduates and criticized for underplaying the importance of poverty in schools and placing novice teachers with the neediest children for only twoyear stints  has been trying to shed its reputation as a polarizing force in education We have people who are not KoolAid drinkers which is great and people who are KoolAid drinkers which is great TFA chief executive Elisa Villanueva Beard said of the conference She said the summit comes at an inflection point for the organization and for education reform at large Although there has been progress toward equity in public schools she said there hasnt been enough and TFA is trying to be very cleareyed about what its going to take to move the needle   Wendy Kopp founded Teach for America 25 years ago Stephen LovekinGetty Images  In a sign of TFAs political firepower President Obama recorded a congratulatory video message to be played at a Saturday night gala He listed the many ways in which TFAs 50000 alumni exercise influence from continuing in the classroom as teachers to starting their own schools to running for political office There are even TFA alumni working for me in the White House Obama said Saturdays sessions dealt with a wide range of issues including how to better serve Latino students the need for more diverse educators the role of white leaders in education reform and rural education Two leaders of the national Black Lives Matter movement  Brittany Packnett executive director of TFAs St Louis office and DeRay Mckesson who last week filed papers to run for mayor of Baltimore  spoke about connections between education and civil rights And in one popular session hundreds of alumni listened to speakers discuss how to dismantle the schooltoprison pipeline a discussion that began with a challenge and a criticism from one of TFAs own Here is the inconvenient truth Education including education reform is part of the problem said Cami Anderson the polarizing former schools chief in Newark NJ and a 1993 TFA alumna We have not made a dent in the problem and in some cases weve made it worse  Chris Christies Newark schools chief steps down following years of turmoil  Anderson said that the reform movement of which TFA is a part has for too long turned a blind eye to complaints about schools quietly pushing out the most difficult kids meting out excessively harsh discipline and having high rates of suspension and expulsion Why has the school reform community been largely silent about the schooltoprison pipeline she said Erin Stauber who served with TFA a decade ago in the Mississippi Delta said afterward that she appreciated the challenge Stauber is still in the classroom teaching thirdgraders at a DC school and said she came for the chance to reconnect with TFAs network and its message about the need for educational opportunity  The next education secretary Polarizing powered by personal story  King the acting education secretary also addressed the schooltoprison pipeline calling it a civil rights issue that can be solved only with more equitable schools a more diverse teaching force and criminal justice reform He spoke of the importance of second chances in his life After he was orphaned at age 12 King made it to Phillips Academy Andover the prestigious New England prep school only to be expelled I acted out I made bad choices I got kicked out of school and folks could have given up on me as we give up on so many young people he said Instead he said adults in his life did not give up on him and he went on to earn three Ivy League degrees King also cofounded Roxbury Prep one of a new class of no excuses charter schools in Massachusetts that serves mostly minority students has strict discipline codes and a high rate of suspensions He did not talk about Roxbury Prep on Saturday   Emma Brown writes about national education and about people with a stake in schools including teachers parents and kids       The Freddie Gray case   Sign up for email updates on the trials Youve signed up for email updates
