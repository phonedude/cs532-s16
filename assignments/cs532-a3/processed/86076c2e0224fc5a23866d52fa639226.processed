170 of the nation8217s top economists have released a letter endorsing Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders8217s plan to reform Wall Street
A letter signed by 170 economists including former Labor Secretary Robert Reich University of Texas Professor James K Galbraith Dean Baker codirector of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington DC Brad Miller former US Congressman from North Carolina and William K Black University of MissouriKansas City endorsed the Sanders plan to reform Wall Street
The economists wrote

In our view Sanders8217 plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another 8216toobigtofail8217 financial crisis The Senator is correct that the biggest banks must be broken up and that a new 21st Century GlassSteagall Act separating investment from commercial banking must be enacted
Wall Street8217s largest banks are now far bigger than they were before the crisis and they still  have every incentive to take excessive risks No major Wall Street  executive has been indicted for the fraudulent behavior that led up to the 2008  crash and fines imposed on the banks have been only a	fraction  of the banks8217	 potential gains In addition the banks and their lobbyists have succeeded in  watering down the DoddFrank reform legislation and  the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk to our economy have still not devised sufficient 8220living wills8221 for winding down their operations in the event of another crisis






Secretary Hillary Clinton8217s more modest proposals do not go far enough They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity but they  leave intact the	titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking  As a result her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans Given the size  and political power of Wall Street her proposals would only invite more dilution  and finagle 
The only way to contain Wall Street8217s excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they	can8217t be watered down That8217s why we support Senator Sanders8217s plans  for busting up the biggest	banks and resurrecting a modernized version of GlassSteagall
Both campaigns are rolling out endorsements on a daily basis but the anger over Wall Street crashing the US economy and walking away with a slap on the wrist is one of the main drivers behind the popularity of Sen Sanders
Bernie Sanders has been on a crusade for years to reform Wall Street and the success of his campaign is the worst nightmare of the country8217s greedy big banks The reality is that little has changed since the Great Recession The big banks got bailed out and learned the wrong lesson from the recession Wall Street feels bulletproof
If the American people want to protect themselves from another economic collapse it will take real reforms like those that are being proposed by Sen Sanders
170 economists agree that Bernie Sanders is the candidate who will hold Wall Street accountable
