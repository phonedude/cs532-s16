		What Do the Koch Brothers Want
		
	
 
			
		 
		
		
		
			
	

	

	

	
	
	
	
	


		
		
		
		
		
		
			
			
   			
			
		
		
		
			
				
					
		
		

	  		

		
		
		
				
					
						
						
					
					
					
						As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision billionaires and large corporations can now spend an unlimited amount of money to influence the political process
Perhaps the biggest winners of Citizens United are Charles and David Koch owners of the secondlargest privately run business in America Koch Industries
Among other things the Koch brothers own oil refineries in Texas Alaska and Minnesota and control some 4000 miles of pipeline
According to Forbes Magazine the Koch brothers are now worth 80 billion and have increased their wealth by 12 billion since last year alone
For the Koch brothers 80 billion in wealth apparently is not good enough Owning the second largest private company in America is apparently not good enoughnbsp It doesnrsquot appear that they will be satisfied until they are able to control the entire political process
It is well known that the Koch brothers have provided the major source of funding to the Tea Party and want to repeal the Affordable Care Act
What else do the Koch brothers want
In 1980 David Koch ran as the Libertarian Partyrsquos vicepresidential candidate in 1980nbsp
Letrsquos take a look at the 1980 Libertarian Party platformnbsp
Here are just a few excerpts of the Libertarian Party platform that David Koch ran on in 1980

ldquoWe urge the repeal of federal campaign finance laws and the immediate abolition of the despotic Federal Election Commissionrdquo
ldquoWe favor the abolition of Medicare and Medicaid programsrdquo
ldquoWe oppose any compulsory insurance or taxsupported plan to provide health services including those which finance abortion servicesrdquo
ldquoWe also favor the deregulation of the medical insurance industryrdquo
ldquoWe favor the repeal of the fraudulent virtually bankrupt and increasingly oppressive Social Security system Pending that repeal participation in Social Security should be made voluntaryrdquo
ldquoWe propose the abolition of the governmental Postal Service The present system in addition to being inefficient encourages governmental surveillance of private correspondence nbspPending abolition we call for an end to the monopoly system and for allowing free competition in all aspects of postal servicerdquo
ldquoWe oppose all personal and corporate income taxation including capital gains taxesrdquo
ldquoWe support the eventual repeal of all taxationrdquo
ldquoAs an interim measure all criminal and civil sanctions against tax evasion should be terminated immediatelyrdquo
ldquoWe support repeal of all law which impede the ability of any person to find employment such as minimum wage lawsrdquo
ldquoWe advocate the complete separation of education and Statenbsp Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals Government ownership operation regulation and subsidy of schools and colleges should be endedrdquo
ldquoWe condemn compulsory education laws hellip and we call for the immediate repeal of such lawsrdquo
ldquoWe support the repeal of all taxes on the income or property of private schools whether profit or nonprofitrdquo
ldquoWe support the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agencyrdquo
ldquoWe support abolition of the Department of Energyrdquo
ldquoWe call for the dissolution of all government agencies concerned with transportation including the Department of Transportationrdquo
ldquoWe demand the return of Americas railroad system to private ownership We call for the privatization of the public roads and national highway systemrdquo
ldquoWe specifically oppose laws requiring an individual to buy or use socalled selfprotection equipment such as safety belts air bags or crash helmetsrdquo
ldquoWe advocate the abolition of the Federal Aviation Administrationrdquo
ldquoWe advocate the abolition of the Food and Drug Administrationrdquo
ldquoWe support an end to all subsidies for childbearing built into our present laws including all welfare plans and the provision of taxsupported services for childrenrdquo
ldquoWe oppose all government welfare relief projects and lsquoaid to the poorrsquo programs All these government programs are privacyinvading paternalistic demeaning and inefficient The proper source of help for such persons is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individualsrdquo
ldquoWe call for the privatization of the inland waterways and of the distribution system that brings water to industry agriculture and householdsrdquo
ldquoWe call for the repeal of the Occupational Safety and Health Actrdquo
ldquoWe call for the abolition of the Consumer Product Safety Commissionrdquo
ldquoWe support the repeal of all state usury lawsrdquo

In other words the agenda of the Koch brothers is not only to defund Obamacarenbsp The agenda of the Koch brothers is to repeal every major piece of legislation that has been signed into law over the past 80 years that has protected the middle class the elderly the children the sick and the most vulnerable in this country
It is clear that the Koch brothers and other right wing billionaires are calling the shots and are pulling the strings of the Republican Partynbsp
And because of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision they now have the power to spend an unlimited amount of money to buy the House of Representatives the Senate and the next President of the United States
If they are allowed to hijack the American political process to defund Obamacare they will be back for morenbsp
Tomorrow it will be Social Security ending Medicare as we know it repealing the minimum wagenbsp It seems to me that the Koch brothers will not be content until they get everything they believe they are entitled to
Our great nation can no longer be hijacked by rightwing billionaires like the Koch brothers
For the sake of our children and our grandchildren for the sake of our economy we have got to let democracy prevail
