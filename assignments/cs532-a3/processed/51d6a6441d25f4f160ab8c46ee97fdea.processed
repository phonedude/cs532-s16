Access denied
http 403
Sorry this imdbcom Internet Movie Database page is not
accessible from your address or browser This page contains
information which may explain why you are seeing this error instead of
the page you wanted Please read this information and if after
reading it you still do not understand why you have been denied access
then you should use the contact details at the end to request
information specific to your case
Note the majority of people seeing this page are innocent
users suffering because of offenders who use the same Internet address
or software as they do Chances are youre not the offender and well
do our best to restore your access once were aware of your
circumstances

The three main reasons for seeing this message are

your browser or proxy server isnt identifying itself and is
blocked because we dont trust it to behave

If your browserproxyagent does not send a HTTP UserAgent
header this server will reject the request Most anonymous software
turns out to be automated junk that hits us too fast and too
hard This deprives our online users of a quick and speedy service
Such denials of service intentional or not will result in loss of
access to our site  
You may be able to gain access by reading the 

information here



youve typed or followed some broken URL

Returning to the home page should get you started


your Internet address or web browser or proxy server has been
banned for misuse of our service
eg overloading our servers with automated requests that are
just too fast

If you want 
your own local copy of the database then you only needed to
have looked for it  
httpimdbcominterfaces will
explain how you can have your own copy of the IMDb and as it runs on
your system you can hit it as hard and as frequently as you like

All requests from NetSonic NetJet NetCarta Autonomy WebWhacker
FlashSite Java102 TeleportPro MemoWeb Microsofts
MSCatapult09 Netscapes CatalogRobot Microsofts Site Analyst
are rejected because of persistent attempts to download huge numbers
of pages as fast as the networks permit
So called webaccelerators can be a nuisance and we dont want
them here We cant block these programs but what we can do is send
this page instead of whatever the software asked for every
time Please disable your URL prefetching web accelerators to avoid
loss of service
Personal web crawlers eg the builtin crawler modes from MSIE
40 and Netscape 40 are not welcome on this site MSIE 40 is more
responsible in that it sometimes identifies itself differently when in
crawler mode so we can block crawling with it Netscape 40 doesnt
identify itself as being in crawler mode so we cant detect it 
instead we have to use more extreme measures to block abusers of our
service  IP addresses of these abusers can be blocked completely once
they misbehave note that Netscape and Microsofts Internet Explorer
are not blocked
Filtering IMDb isnt allowed so WebWasher filters etc arent
allowed If everyone used a banner ad filter the vast majority of
sites would run out of money to provide you with free
services its either banner ads or subscription fees
