The Super Bowl is the NFLs flagship event each year and the league has invested a lot in the events branding and broadcasting In light of that investment its understandable that the NFL would be protective of its trademarks and copyrights surrounding it But that protectiveness has led to the NFL and other businesses around it perpetuating a number of myths about what you can and cant do with the Super Bowlincluding the words Super Bowl
Saying Super Bowl in an ad
Were already being bombarded by ads from sports bars grocery stores fastfood chains and countless other companies tying their ads in to The Big Game Its a completely ridiculous circumlocution that just draws attention to itself and the absurdity that is trademark law Obviously theyre talking about the Super Bowl theyre clearly not talking about the CalStanford game or a highstakes poker match or a rugby match in Twickenham
Conventional wisdom is that advertisers are avoiding calling a Super Bowl a Super Bowl because they dont want to infringe on the NFLs trademark in the name But if thats the case its because the advertisers are being overly cautious not because theyd actually be doing anything illegal
The core purpose of trademark law has always been to identify the source of goodsto make sure that some competitor doesnt try to pass off its goods as the genuine article Over the years that original purpose has been added to and supplemented with other theories but its fundamental aim remains the same keeping consumers from being fooled as to whether or not the trademark owner is making or endorsing the person using the trademark without permission
This doesnt mean that people are barred from using trademarked terms though Burger King can use the terms McDonalds and Big Mac in its ads to refer to its competitor movies and TV shows can use and display products without permissionif they make fake brands or blur them out its either out of an excess of caution or in the hope that brands later become sponsors
No one is going to think that your local grocery is offering sales on chicken wings and Doritos because theyre sponsoring the Super Bowl or are representing the NFL Theyre saying Super Bowl because thats how human beings refer to this Sundays broadcast of the National Football Leagues championship game And theyre allowed to speak like human beings just like you and I are free to talk tweet and text about the game
Taping describing or even talking about the game
The NFL has a strange take on what people can do with the broadcast of the game too If youve watched enough football youve undoubtedly seen this odd little clip
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvGQ31UpVxg4
Thevoiceover in the clip says
This telecast is copyrighted by the NFL for the private use of our audience Any other use of this telecast or any pictures descriptions or accounts of the game without the NFLs consent is prohibited
That second sentence is bunk from a legal standpoint It is not illegal to describe or give an account of one of the biggest media events of the year You can talk about the Super Bowl without infringing copyright This is not a case of the NFL politely looking the other way while most of America in public and private in casual conversations and in commercial broadcasts discusses the game without the NFLs permission The NFL would be laughed out of court for trying to prevent them from doing sojust because you have a copyright in a work doesnt mean you can prevent people from talking about it Copyright simply doesnt extend that far
The NFL is also drastically overstating its case when it comes to actual copies of the game or pictures coming from it You can record the Super Bowl Its been undeniably unquestionably legal since 1984 that you can record the broadcast to watch later and skip commercials if youre so inclined And the fair use doctrine that allows you to do this also lets you use those recordings for other purposes too If you want to use clips for commentary or criticism or news reporting of some aspect of the game or the broadcast thats perfectly legal too
But the NFL has been using that disclaimer or some form of itbasically miseducating America about copyright lawfor years Some years ago one group actually complainedabout the broadcast of these falsehoods to the Federal Trade Commission but didnt get too far
In fact the NFL has overreached so far on this in the past that when copyright professor Wendy Seltzer posted a video clip of that very disclaimer in order to critique it the NFL sent a takedown notice to remove the clip from YouTube After several rounds of ironydeficient messages back and forth the clip was reinstated and thus your ability to see it and its successors today remains unprohibited by the NFL and copyright law
So if you find yourself hesitating about recording The Big Game because of the example set by the NFL and scores of advertisers you can just relax You can tape the Super Bowl You can call it by its actual name And you can discuss it all you want at the water cooler the next day The law cant stop youno matter what the NFL says
