		Broncos Mindblowing stats
	
	
		
			1
		
		
			No Offense Peyton or Brock it didnt matter The Broncos averaged just 222 PPG 19th in league in 2015 and are the secondlowest ranked offense to ever make the Super Bowl trailing only the 2008 Steelers 217 20th
		
	
	
		
			2
		
		
			Keep em close As the Patriots know too well the Broncos are superior in close games In 2015 Denver had 11 wins by seven points or less including the postseason Thats the most in a single season since 1940
		
	
	
		
			3
		
		
			Super bad Denver will be making its eighth Super Bowl appearance tying the franchise with Dallas New England and Pittsburgh for most in NFL history However they are the only team of the four to have a losing record in the Big Game 25
		
	
	
	
	
		Panthers Mindblowing stats
	
	
		
			1
		
		
			Running it up Carolinas ground game is consistently consistent Led by Jonathan Stewart and Newton the Panthers have rushed for 100 yards in 31 consecutive games including the postseason Its the longest streak of any team since the 197476 Steelers 37 who won two Super Bowls
		
	
	
		
			2
		
		
			Dominant defensive duo Its hard to get through or past Kuechly and Thomas Davis Carolinas veteran linebackers were two of just three NFL players to record 100 tackles and fourplus interceptions this season Kuechly 118 4 Davis 105 4	
	
	
	
		
			3
