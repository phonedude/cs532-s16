Clinton said she hasnt been influenced by Wall Street  heres why shes dead wrong



It is wrong and unfair toattack or critique candidates on anything but substance policy orrecord and Clintons statements last night definitely fall underneath this umbrella The followingis not an unbridled attack against Clinton but a response to a statement she made last night that went unanswered andshould not have



Whilebeing questioned about her Wall Street ties Clinton said to Anderson Cooper the moderator


But you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me name anything theyve influenced me on Just name one thing Im out here every day saying Im going to shut them down Im going after them


Challenge accepted

In 2007 while running for president Clinton made campaign speeches attackingthetax break for hedgefund and privateequity executives  one of theinfamous loopholes that allows rich people to pay way less in taxes than theyre supposed to but did not sign her name onto legislation that would have ended the tax break and closed the loophole

Just as shes doing now shewas out there every day saying Im going to shut them down but did not actually use her electedofficialpowerto keep her word and follow through with the simple act of signing her name onto someone elses bill

As Politico reports


When Clinton had a chance to support a 2007 bill that aimed to curb a tax breakshepublicly decriedfor hedgefund and privateequity executives she failed to sign on


Clinton said one thing in public but did another behind closed doors She attacked Wall Street to voters but helped them as a senator

Why

Because Wall Street executives were the biggest donors to her 2006 Senate campaign andher 2008 presidential campaign

Clinton got millions from the financial industrywhile also protecting them she is most assuredlyinfluenced by her Wall Street donors

Thats one thing right there per Clintons request but heres even more

In 2007 and 2008 Clinton did not work with the other senators in Congress to pass a housing bill to stop individual financial players from destroying the economy

As ProPublica reports


When a broad housing bill finally became law in 2008 Clinton was not among the more than dozen senators credited by party leaders as playing a key role


She was not a leader in the Senate to stop Wall Streets reckless behavior

In fact she was barelyeven a follower

Additionally as Politico reports


Clinton also has some history with the shadowbanking world she says is a continuing risk to the financial system While in the Senate she made a littlenoticed overture to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson who was involved in talks to rescue giant insurer AIG with government funds She was calling on behalf of wealthy investors who stood to lose millions and had hired two longtime Clinton associates to represent them


So not only did she not battlefor the American people against Wall Street or even follow those who were fighting for the citizens she actually fought on Wall Streets behalf

Furthermore the classic Cut it out 2007 speechthat Clinton has used as evidence of her tough on Wall Street record and nowsuddenly stopped referencing was not quite as strict and severe as shes tried to make it seem

As Politico reports


For the second time in the debates she referenced a speech she gave to executives before the economic meltdown In Octobers debate she had described herself as going to Wall Street and saying Cut it out Quit foreclosing on homes Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors


But what did that speech actually entail


Clinton gave a shoutout to her wonderful donors in the audience and asked the bankers to voluntarily suspend foreclosures and freeze interest rates on adjustable subprime mortgages She praised Wall Street for its role in creating the nations wealth then added that too many American families are not sharing in that prosperity

She said the brewing economic troubles werent mainly the fault of banks not by a long shot but added they needed to shoulder responsibility for their role While there was plenty of blame to go around for the spate of reckless lending and while Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis it certainly had a hand in making it worse and needs to help us solve it

Finally Clinton said if the banks didnt take the voluntary steps she proposed I will consider legislation to address the problem


Clinton basically praised Wall Street for their greed and recklessness and asked them to voluntarily stop being so terribly singleminded and selfish

Guess what

They didnt listen to her and less than a month later the economy crashed

Also contrary to what Clinton said the big financial institutionsabsolutely were mainly at fault for the financial crisis

As The New York Times reports


The 2008 financial crisis was an avoidable disaster caused by widespread failures in government regulation corporate mismanagement and heedless risktaking by Wall Street according to the conclusions of a federal inquiry


The behemoth financial industry as well as the lack of government regulation was the only one at fault for the 2007 crisis not the homeowners who got preyed on mostly people of color and immigrants groups that are both disproportionately likely to be poor or anyone else

For her to paint otherwise is untrue and scary and shows how close and friendly she is with Wall Street

Justimagine for instance how different the speech Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders would have given to Wall Street in 2007 or any other year



Hillary Clinton is obviously influenced by the millions Wall Street has given herin campaign donations and speaking fees she didnt sign onto legislation that would have ended a tax break she attacked in public she didnt help lead the Senate push to pass housing legislation she didnt castigate and barely tuttutted Wall Street in her infamous cut it out speech and she actually called on behalf of wealthy investors to see if she could help them save their millions and millions at a steep cost to thetaxpayer

As Clintonbops from argument to argument trying to persuade the public she isnt tied to Wall Street Cut it out 911 Wall Street people are running attack ads against me etc etc  keep in mind her record

Its nowhere near as squeaky clean as she so adamantly professes it is and Ive got to tell you this level of misrepresentation basically lying makes me angry Really angry

Our economyand the human beings living underneath itwereruined by the greed and recklessness onWall Street

Peoples lives were destroyed

Politics isnt some sort of game its about real peoples lives and real people getting hurt

When a politician misrepresents herself so thoroughly its not just dishonest or disingenuous its dangerous

Clinton will not attack Wall Street as her record and current platform show and that poses a massive risk to you and me and everybody else living underneath thisas even Jimmy Carter understands America to beoligarchic state

Wall Street very well might crash the economy and very soontheyre already too big to fail again

We need a president who isnt beholden to those interests and who has fought hisher whole life to stop Wall Street not taken money from helped andsupported them

Peoples lives are at stake here

Question everything
