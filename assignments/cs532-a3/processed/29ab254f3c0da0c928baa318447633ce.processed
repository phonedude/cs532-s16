For the Beyhive this is a lot to process 
Itll take a few trips to Red Lobster before we can fully wrap our minds around everything this new song represents but for now here are four of the most amazing things about Beyonces Formation 
1 It exists  
Well yeah anytime one of the worlds biggest pop stars releases a new single its big news There are plenty of Beyonce hallmarks  defensiveness toward quothatersquot and paparazzi a call to arms for her fellow ladies to quotget in formationquot and quotslayquot the notion that she quotjust might be a black Bill Gates in the makingquot And theres no doubt producer Mike Will Made It crafted that beat with only Beyonce in mind  no other singer could handle it 
Also This song is a meme in audio form perfectly structured for adoration on social media As Rolling Stone pointed out Beyonces online store was immediately updated with merch based on Formations many catchphrases  quotI twirl on them hatersquot quotI got hot sauce in my bagquot quotSlayquot This was most definitely a song constructed with Twitter Instagram Snapchat and onesecond gifs in mind Culturally having hot sauce in your bag is going to become A Thing just like putting a ring on it became A Thing and not being ready for ones jelly became A Thing 
But all that aside Formation isnt necessarily a next step we couldve seen coming from Beyonce Whats most interesting about Formation is how openly Beyonce speaks on her Gulf Coast bona fides her AlabamaLouisianaTexas heritage her love of soul food and hot sauce and most notably her AfricanAmericanness quotI like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrilsquot This brings us to 
2 That video THAT VIDEO 
Well we now have a frontrunner at this years MTV Video Music Awards 
You will hear a lot in the coming days about what a sociopolitical statement Beyonce made with Formation but the truth is most of this is coming not from the lyrics but the video in which Beyonce drowns a flooded New Orleans police car pits cops against a child dancer in a tableau of Black Lives Matter protestation gives cameos to both her dancing daughter Blue Ivy in a nod to her cultural pride and genderfluid New Orleans icon Big Freedia one of several nods to the LGBTQ world Its as if Beyonce said quotI want my own To Pimp a Butterfly and I want it to go down in five minutes of straight fire and I want it NOWquot 
3 The race for the title of Worlds Biggest Pop Star continues unabated 
Last summer was there any doubt the worlds biggest pop star was Taylor Swift with the unprecedented success and attention of her 1989 World Tour Then came Adele and Hello and 25 which set sales and listenership records that may never be broken And now we have Beyonce going nuclear with Formation less than 24 hours before performing at halftime of the Super Bowl 
The parallel here is mens tennis where you have Roger Federer Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic obliterating each other and the record book at every major turn The Andy Murray of this metaphor is Katy Perry a worldclass talent who can beat the other three on any given day yet at the moment clearly isnt quite on their historic level Swift Beyonce and Adele are three of the most accomplished women on the planet and they all have the very same job Each time one makes a move you wonder how the next will top it Its fascinating to watch 
4 We cant stress this enough Beyonce is going to perform Formation at halftime of the Super Bowl 
Yes this incendiary call to pop arms will receive its live premiere on the grandest stage imaginable courtesy of the corporatizedtodeath National Football League with Beyonces backing band being  Coldplay Exactly how much hot sauce does Chris Martin carry in his bag we wonder 
Twelve years after Janet Jackson and Nipplegate the NFL is still deathly afraid of controversy when it comes to its pop culture partners Remember the league sued the everloving bejeezus out of MIA when she dropped an Sbomb and flipped off the camera during Madonnas 2012 headlining show Seriously they might be the only entity actually more powerful than the Illuminati 
Now is Beyonce really going to head out to midfield at halftime straddling a Louisiana cop car surrounded by riot gearclad police with Martin nervously cueing up Fix You in the background Not likely But itll be interesting to find out in the coming days how much the NFL knew about Formation before the release of its video 
Kickoff is coming soon Let the game begin so we can all get to halftime already
