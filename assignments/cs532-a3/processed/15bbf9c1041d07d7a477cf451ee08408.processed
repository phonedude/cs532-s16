by Nick Tylwalk 6d ago Follow nick_tylwalk        TWEET    SHARE      GPLUS    nbspPin it   0 Comments         When you settle in to watch the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos compete for the championship this evening during Super Bowl 50 yoursquore probably also going to be anticipating a handful of superhero movie trailers Thatrsquos a logical expectation given that even in an era when there are more tools than ever for getting the word out about upcoming movies advertising during the NFLrsquos big game provides studios with the grandest possible stage Yoursquod be right too since some of the biggest upcoming superhero movies should have a presence during the broadcast though not all of them DC fans in particular are likely to come away disappointed So which superhero movie trailers are going to run Thanks to Fandango we have a pretty good idea what wersquoll be seeing during breaks in the action from Santa Clara Letrsquos run them down from definite to no way mdash and if we end up being wrong wersquoll apologize in advance Yes Deadpool This canrsquot count as a surprise given the way that Fox has been pulling out every possible stop to promote its Rrated superhero romp ahead of its February 12 release Generally that would be too close to the Super Bowl for most movie studios to bother with an ad buy but this is no normal superhero movie and it hasnrsquot been sticking to the usual marketing script The Merc With a Mouth will pop up during the big game you can bank on that Probably XMen Apocalypse More From Movies212  Deadpool Has Sights Set On RecordBreaking Box Office Weekend212  Deadpool Review ndash A Film That Doesnrsquot Hold Back212  Deadpool PostCredits Scenes Explained211  Could Justice League Be Pushed Back In Favor Of Ben Affleck Batman Movie211  Batman V Superman New IMAX Poster Debuts With Final Trailer Fandango says that Fox has purchased two spots meaning one of them could be filled by its other 2016 superhero movie Since XMen Apocalypse hits theaters in May this might actually be a little early for another full length trailer but again the Super Bowl only comes around once a year The catch could be if Fox wants to diversify and do something besides all superheroes in which case the mutants might miss out Possibly Captain America Civil War Disney has a tendency to not always do the obvious thing when it comes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so even though this would seem like a nobrainer opportunity to hit the world with some new Civil War footage that might not happen It is being reported that Disney has multiple spots lined up during the pregame show and the football game itself but it also has a bunch of films to push No Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice Despite hope running high that wersquod get one more full length trailer and it would debut during Super Bowl 50 thatrsquos not happening because Warner Bros didnrsquot buy any ad time What outlets like IGN are saying is that Batman v Superman could feature in another companyrsquos commercial so donrsquot be shocked if we still have something to discuss on Monday even if itrsquos not a trailer Suicide Squad With Warner Bros on the proverbial sidelines no chance for anything here Besides this movie just got a full length trailer not that long ago Doctor Strange As awesome as this would be itrsquos still too far off and is smack dab in the middle of filming right now Next BSPs Guide to Upcoming Superhero Movies Donrsquot forget that whatever superhero movie trailers end up airing are likely to have extended versions online where they can beyond the 30 or 60 seconds allotted to them on TV Also while it doesnrsquot fit our definition of a superhero movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows is definitely a comic book movie and is one that would fit into our ldquoYesrdquo category as well Enjoy the big game and the previews                   RelatedStories     Batman V Superman Good Morning America
