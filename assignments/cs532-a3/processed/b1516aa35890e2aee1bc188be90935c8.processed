criticism from veterans leader  0143Cooper pointed to 18 VA inspector general reports detailing problems plaguing the VA and asked Sanders why it took him so long to act Read MoreWell a fair question  And I think you know the answer is that we have worked on many many issues Sanders said And your point is fair that we shouldve acted sooner We shouldve known what was going on in Phoenix those long waiting lines and the lies that some administrators were telling usIt is an issue that could come back to haunt the Vermont senator in his bid to win over the very military veterans and families he vowed to serve during his two year chairmanship on the Veterans Affairs CommitteeVeterans groups and others criticize Sanders for what they call a lack of oversight of the VA and for at times coming to its defense in the midst of the scandal that rocked the agency in 2014Paul Rieckhoff founder and CEO of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America said Sanders largely ignored the appeals of organizations like his during a time when media and government reports exposed how veterans were waiting months for appointments and VA officials were covering up the delaysFor far too long he was apologizing for the VA He was refusing to acknowledge the severity He was positioning it as a smaller issue than it was while veterans were dying waiting for care Rieckhoff told CNNFor more than a year CNN reported on veterans deaths and delays at VA facilities across the country including detailed investigations in November 2013 and January 2014 examining deaths at two VA facilities in South Carolina and GeorgiaAn internal VA audit later uncovered faulty scheduling practices and a systemic lack of integrity within some VA facilitiesRieckhoff says Sanders had to be ignoring what was happening on the other side of the Capitol during this time when House Committee on Veterans Affairs investigators were digging up records swearing in whistleblowers and exposing the massive scandalDuring the time the House VA committee held 42 separate hearings related to oversight of the VA the Senate VA committee  chaired by Sanders  held about seven hearings on these issuesAt the boiling point of the VA scandal in 2014 after CNN reported about secret wait lists at the Phoenix VA the Senate committee held a hearing in which Sanders supported an independent investigation Yet he also praised the VA for serving 200000 veterans a day and cautioned about rushing to judgmentThe point I want to make is that when you are dealing with 200000 people if you did better than any other health institution in the world there would be thousands of people every single day who would say I dont like what Im getting And we have to put that all of that in the context of the size of the VA Sanders said at the hearing on May 15 2014Sanders appeared on CNN the same day and again cautioned against a rush to judgmentDid the delays in care of these people on the secret waiting list actually cause these deaths We dont know Sanders saidThe following week Republican senators on the committee sent Sanders a letter complaining about the lack of actionAs we have previously stated the committee has held a limited number of hearings on the issues faced by the department  Our nations veterans do not deserve to wait to receive their benefits andor needed health care services the senators wrote in a letterThe scandal reached its climax when VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned May 30 2014Sanders did later acknowledge the severity of problems at the Phoenix VA and others and worked with members of the House VA committee to pass the Veterans Access Choice and Accountability Act One of the laws provisions is for funding allowing veterans to obtain private care if waits are too long within the VADespite criticisms some veterans groups have supported SandersVeterans of Foreign Wars presented Sanders with its 2015 Congressional Award for his work on the Senate committeeHe has been

country who put their lives on the line to defend us Sanders said referring to 15 billion given to the Department of Veterans Affairs to decrease wait times and reform the troubled agencyDan Caldwell political director of the conservative group Concerned Veterans for America remains unconvincedSenator Sanders will likely continue to try and tout his time as Senate VA Chairman But an honest look at his time as chairman will show that he failed in his responsibility to oversee the VA and was not a leader in the fight to reform and fix the VA Caldwell said in a statement LendingTreeRates hit 302
