Descriptionedit




Cross sectioned great grey owl specimen showing the extent of the body plumage Zoological Museum Copenhagen


Adults have a large rounded head with a grey face and yellow eyes with darker circles around them The underparts are light with dark streaks the upper parts are grey with pale bars This owl does not have ear tufts and has the largest facial disc of any raptor
In terms of length the great grey owl is believed to exceed the Eurasian eagleowl and the Blakistons fish owl as the worlds largest owl3 The great grey is outweighed by those two species as well as several others including most of the Bubo genus4 Much of its size is deceptive since this species fluffy feathers large head and the longest tail of any extant owl obscure a body lighter than that of most other large owls The length ranges from 61 to 84160cm 24 to 33160in averaging 72160cm 28160in for females and 67160cm 26160in for males The wingspan can exceed 152160cm 60160in but averages 142160cm 56160in for females and 140160cm 55160in for males The adult weight ranges from 580 to 1900160g 128 to 419160lb averaging 1290160g 284160lb for females and 1000160g 22160lb for males5 The males are usually smaller than females as with most owl species2
Taxonomyedit
There are two recognized races of the great grey owl spread across North America and Eurasia6

S n nebulosa Forster 1772 North America from central Alaska east to southwestern Quebec and south to northern California northern Idaho western Montana Wyoming and northeastern Minnesota
S n lapponica Thunberg 1798 Northern Eurasia from Fennoscandia through Siberia to Sakhalin and Koryakland to Lithuania Lake Baikal Kazakhstan Mongolia Manchuria and northeastern China

Breedingedit




Egg Collection Museum Wiesbaden


They breed in North America from as far east as Quebec2 to the Pacific coast and Alaska and from Finland and Estonia across northern Asia They are permanent residents but may move south and southeast when food is scarce A small population estimated at less than 100 birds occurs in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California This population is the southernmost population of the species range and is listed Endangered under Californias Endangered Species Act In Europe they are found breeding in Norway and Sweden and more numerously through Finland and Russia




Adult female


Their breeding habitat is the dense coniferous forests of the taiga near open areas such as meadows or bogs Great grey owls do not build nests so typically use nests previously used by a large bird such as a raptor They will also nest in brokentopped trees and cavities in large trees Nesting may occur from March to May Four eggs are the usual clutch size Eggs average 427160mm 168160in wide and 535160mm 211160in long The incubation period is about 30 days ranging from 28 to 36 days Brooding lasts 2 to 3 weeks after which the female starts roosting on a tree near nests The young jump or fall from the nest at 3 to 4 weeks and start to fly 1 to 2 weeks after this Most offspring remain near their natal sites for many months after fledging
The abundance of food in the area usually affects the number of eggs a female lays a feature quite common in northern owl species If food is scarce they may travel a fair distance to find more prey with considerable movements by large numbers in some years of particularly scarce prey Though they do not migrate many are at least somewhat nomadic
Feedingedit




Owl in flight


These birds wait listen and watch for prey then swoop down they also may fly low through open areas in search of prey Their large facial disks also known as ruffs focus sound and the asymmetrical placement of their ears assists them in locating prey because of the lack of light during the late and early hours in which they hunt On the nesting grounds they mainly hunt at night and near dawn and dusk at other times they are active mostly during the night
They have excellent hearing and may locate and then capture prey moving beneath 60160cm 20160ft of snow in a series of tunnels solely with that sense They then can crash to a snow depth roughly equal to their own body size to grab their prey Only this species and more infrequently other fairly large owls from the Strix genus are known to snowplunge for prey a habit that is thought to require superb hearing not possessed by all types of owls7
Unlike the more versatile eagle and horned owls great grey owls rely almost fully upon small rodents with voles being their most important food source Locally alternative prey animals usually comprising less than 20 of prey intake include hares moles shrews weasels thrushes grouse grey jays small hawks and ducks Although seldom preyed upon great grey owl nestlings and juveniles may themselves fall prey to bears fishers and large hawks especially Northern goshawks while adults may fall prey to Bubo owls golden eagles and lynxes
The song of the male is a series of very deep rhythmic hoots whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo At other times adults are normally silent The young may chatter shriek or hiss
Habitatedit
The harvest of timber from the great grey owls habitat is perhaps the greatest threat to this species8 Intensified timber management typically reduces live and dead largediameter trees used for nesting leaning trees used by juveniles for roosting before they can fly and dense canopy closures in stands used by juveniles for cover and protection8 If perches are not left in clearcuts great grey owls cannot readily hunt in them Although humanmade structures made specifically for use by this species have been utilized by these owls the species is far more common in areas protected from logging Livestock grazing in meadows also adversely affects great grey owls by reducing habitat for preferred prey species8

Due to their large size great grey owls have few natural predators Great horned owls various small carnivores and black bears have been documented preying on young but such predators rarely threaten adults and owls have been known to fend off animals as large as black bears when defending their nests9 The only known predator of adult great grey owls is the Eurasian eagleowl Bubo bubo which occasionally preys on the former in parts of Europe10
Provincial birdedit
The great grey owl is the provincial bird of Manitoba where it is known as the great gray owl
