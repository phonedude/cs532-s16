DERRICK COLEMAN They gave up on me But I8217ve been deaf since I was three so I didn8217t listen
PETER This is the Seattle Seahawk8217s Derrick Coleman doing the voice over for a stirring bit of cinematography
DERRICK COLEMAN And now I8217m here with the loudest fans in the NFL cheering me on
PETER But this is no documentary film It8217s a commercial from last year8217s Super Bowl for Duracell batteries Today on BackStory the ad industry in America We8217ll hear how advertisers perfected the art of the soft sell the catchy jingle and the association with AllAmerican heroes
MALE SPEAKER 1 Tang chosen for the Gemini astronauts
PETER Plus ads for BackStory that you asked us to produce
MALE SPEAKER 1 This history is moving fast people Don8217t delay
PETER A history of advertising today on BackStory Don8217t go away Major funding for BackStory is provided by an anonymous donor the University of Virginia the National Endowment for the Humanities the Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations
MALE SPEAKER 1 From the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities this is BackStory with the American History Guys
BRIAN Welcome to the show I8217m Brian Balogh
PETER I8217m Peter Onuf
ED And I8217m Ed Ayers Now if you8217re listening to this show on the radio you probably heard Peter do something a few minutes ago that we in the business refer to as a billboard It8217s at oneminute tease apparently effective for the rest of the show complete with highlights some big questions for the hour some catchy music And it8217s basically an attempt to razzle dazzle you in the sticking with us through the new break
Well that radio billboard has its roots in the preradio age And like a lot of what we talk about on BackStory it dates back to the last few decades of the 19th century
CATHERINE GUDIS There are banners There are posters for circuses and other celebrations
PETER This is Cathy Gudis a historian in California who has written about advertising8217s early days A lot of it centered on East Coast cities but had a certain Wild West sensibility to it Picture roving wagons covered with enormous ads itinerant men with sandwich boards or ads on their hats gangs of bill posters prowling in the streets with buckets of wheat paste and broadsides announcing all manner of products and events Everywhere you looked Gudis says somebody would be trying to razzle dazzle you into seeing the benefits of what they had to sell
CATHERINE GUDIS You might have a series of textbased handbills or theater programs They look like theater programs And they8217re slathered on the exteriors of the buildings at street level But then as you sort of almost look up the side of the building the ads become larger and more pictorial until you get to the top of the building where an electrically illuminated ad is outlined There8217s an image There are words spelled out And there8217s revolving color that just sort of creates an entire cityscape of commerce
ED Now it does make sense that advertisers in this era would focus on cities because dense populations meant that you got the most bang for your advertising buck But Gudis says there were countryscapes of commerce as well
CATHERINE GUDIS Right There8217s actually a description of a few people who really prided themselves on going into remote areas with their waders on and painting on a rock so a train that might be passing by would have this perfect vision of it
ED Whether they were painted on big illuminated signs in the city screaming at passing trains from trees and rocks in the country or filling the space between articles in local newspapers one type of ad appeared everywhere8211 ads for patent medicines
CATHERINE GUDIS You8217d learn of something like Buchu which was recommended for everything from syphilis to rheumatism Or you might have seen Jones8217 Tonic a sure cure for paralysis vertigo insomnia jim jams8211 don8217t ask me what jim jams were
PETER If the conditions these socalled medicines were curing seem mysterious their ingredients were even more so Sometimes these potions would contain opium morphine More often they would contain potent doses of grain alcohol One manufacturer boasted that8211 I8217m quoting8211 8220I can advertise dishwater and sell it just as well as an article of merit It is all in the advertising8221
ED On the back of this advertising patent medicine sales climbed from a total of round 35 million before the Civil War to 75 million by the turn of the century And there are two ways of looking at this On the one hand patent medicines put advertising on the map and showed that advertising in itself could be a profitable business A lot of the early ad agents got their start hocking patent medicine ads to newspaper and magazine printers
But on the other hand the shadiness of the whole patent medicine enterprise kind of tarred advertising and gave it a bad name It would take a whole new generation of advertisers with a whole new approach to advertising to really turn that story around
BRIAN Across America this weekend a lot of people are talking about football But as there always is on Super Bowl Sunday there is just as much excitement8211 if not more8211 about what8217s taking place off the field interstices of the big game the advertising So today on the show we8217re looking at advertising8217s history How did advertising move from the margins of respectability to the 180 billion industry that it is today And why is it that Americans today don8217t just tolerate advertising8217s ubiquity they actually celebrate it

									ED We8217ll begin where we left off in the last couple of decades of the 19th century It was then that a handful of ad middleman started making a name for themselves as ad agents who could be trusted Now these weren8217t the flybynight guys of a few years earlier known for extorting as much as possible from publishers and advertisers alike These were guys with solid circulation figures clear fee structures and standards of what they would and wouldn8217t sell
So patent medicines were out And things like well soap we8217re in
PETER Oh yeah
ED So guys I8217ve got a magazine ad from this period that I want to share with you It8217s for Pears the famous English complexion soap and features the portrait of Henry Ward Beecher a kind of rock star preacher of the day with a kind of a mullet actually along with a supposed a quotation from Beecher extolling the virtues of this wonderful soap And it8217s typical of a lot of what was coming out of these early ad agencies Places like NW Ayer amp Son and J Walter Thompson were discovering that they were in the business of selling trust And their ads were all about convincing consumers that these products were trustworthy
PETER Uhhuh Right
ED So you have that image in your head
PETER Yep
ED Now consider this one It8217s also a soap ad8211 Woodbury Soap8211 but it8217s from a few decades later 1917 to be exact It8217s in full color A young woman lounges in a revealing dress A handsome man in a suit leans over her He8217s clasping her hand and kissing her neck The tagline running across the top of the page is simple 8220A skin you love to touch8221
So this seems pretty racy for 1911
KATHLEEN FRANZ Pretty sexy right
ED Yeah really
KATHLEEN FRANZ Yeah Some more conservative magazines wouldn8217t take this ad
ED This is Kathleen Franz She8217s a historian who8217s working on a new Smithsonian exhibit about the history of advertising And when I spoke to her she pointed out that there8217s something besides the raciness of this second ad that makes a groundbreaking And that8217s that there8217s hardly anything in it about soap itself
KATHLEEN FRANZ One of the things about the creator of this ad and why it8217s such a revolutionary ad is that it is moving very quickly into what the product can do for the consumer and how it will change their life It puts the product at the bottom of the ad not central to the ad It gives you a view of the consumer which is you right I mean this is completely aspirational
The product can bridge that gap between your working class status or lower middle class status and the achievement of an American dream which here is very represented by not only the beautiful clothing and the kind of wealth that exudes but also this kind of sexiness The message that the ad wants to give to you and wants you to believe in is that if you use this soap you8217ll be a more attractive person
ED So who8217s behind this ad It seems to me it8217s persuasive even 100 years later I believe she does attract men So who was the mastermind that realized this is the direction advertising should take
KATHLEEN FRANZ Well it was a woman named Helen Landsdowne Resor There are women in advertising in this period They are helping shape the new messaging that advertising is putting out this move really from telling you again about the product and what the product is and moving it to a more emotional appeal And that really sets modern advertising
So the interesting thing about Helen Resor is really that she8217s at the top of the company She8217s running the offices of J Walter Thompson one of the largest advertising agencies in the world with her husband8217s family She8217s really the creative side of the house And he8217s doing the business side And she8217s cultivating this sort of new type of emotionalbased advertising
ED I am struck by the fact that there would be a place for women in this as there had not been a place for women in any kind of industry before So how do you explain that Kathleen
KATHLEEN FRANZ I think women knew how to reach other women And the male advertisers who are running these companies begin to understand that especially in this period And so you know J Walter Thompson really had built its reputation on advertising in women8217s magazines They knew that women were the primary consumers of most products especially for the household so soaps things that are being mass produced at this time And they are responding to this emotional appeal
And Helen Landsdowne Resor she tailors the advertising to them She is saying it8217s OK for women to be sexy and that products can help with that And you sales numbers coming back is that it reportedly increased sales of this soap 1000 So when you have the marketing data back to say that these kinds of very womencentered approaches are working it8217s all the more reason to trust the women who are writing the ads
ED Kathleen France is a historian at American University She8217s one of the curators of an upcoming Smithsonian exhibition on the history of advertising in America

									PETER We8217re back with BackStory I8217m Peter Onuf
BRIAN I8217m Brian Balogh
ED And I8217m Ed Ayers Today on the show we8217re marking advertising8217s annual championship match the Super Bowl with an hour on the history of advertising in America We8217ve heard a little bit about the early days of the advertising industry in the first couple of decades the 20th century We8217re going to pick up our story now in the 1920s the point at which the industry hit the road
PETER In the 1920s Americans were falling in love with their cars Tens of millions of them were taking to the roads And where motorist went billboards quickly followed
Driving down the highway Americans would see row after row of horizontally spanning billboards just like we might see today Many of them were full of color and illuminated by electric lighting But that8217s not all The roads signs were also blanketed in a number of smaller and less professional ads tacked up on trees and poles
It was all largely unregulated Companies and the ad agents working for them could put up billboards wherever landowners would rent them space Before long the roadsides were crowded with commerce
BRIAN Historian Cathy Gudis who we heard from at the top of today8217s show has written about this early efflorescence of outdoor advertising and about the opposition that grew up alongside it She told me that women were very much the forefront of the movement that worked for decades to do away with these billboards
CATHERINE GUDIS I think it was in part springing from the municipal housekeeping movement of an earlier period This idea that women were responsible for civilizing the home and also had a knowledge of beauty and that they were somehow going to be keepers of the landscape too8211
BRIAN So who was supporting billboards
CATHERINE GUDIS Well the billboard boys of course
BRIAN The boys Billboard boys
CATHERINE GUDIS Well the women like to call them varyingly the boys of the barons I love the idea of the barons because it suggests that they are colonizing the landscape8211
BRIAN Yeah
CATHERINE GUDIS 8211taking it over with commercial advertising And they are I mean that8217s the goal It8217s partly because the industry becomes big and incorporates nationally and has a lobbying arm It8217s called the Outdoor Advertising Association of America
BRIAN It sounds so8211
CATHERINE GUDIS And they resented8211
BRIAN It sounds so pastoral
CATHERINE GUDIS Oh it8217s so pastoral It8217s not billboards Right It8217s not litter on a stick It8217s outdoor advertising
BRIAN No Litter on a stick All right So what do the barons call the women I don8217t want to know the locker room term But what do they call them in public
CATHERINE GUDIS The language that they use persistently is incredibly gendered They are these flowersniffing aesthetes with no concern Right The have no concern
BRIAN Flowersniffing no less
CATHERINE GUDIS Oh yeah Because this idea that they are aesthetes with no conception of the financial ramifications of being able to advertise across the American landscape
BRIAN Well how did these flowersniffing ladies socalled8211 what do they bring to the table How do they fight these guys who are a national industry
CATHERINE GUDIS They basically harness their powers through women8217s clubs and the garden clubs And so for instance this one woman named Elizabeth Lawton who is so impressive she organizes a group called the National Roadside Counsel And put it this way the outdoor industry disliked her to the extent that when I went through their files I found her information in a file that was labeled nuisances abated And on the top was her obituary
LAUGHTER
So she was definitely a thorn
BRIAN You8217re not suggesting foul play are you
CATHERINE GUDIS No foul play I really don8217t think there was foul play But I think she was just so annoying She annoyed them to no end The letter writing campaigns were out of control letters to the editor And they8217re mostly middle class women who were writing a lot of letters
BRIAN And what did these women want Did they want advertising to go away I mean what was their goal
CATHERINE GUDIS Yeah I mean I think that would8217ve been an ideal What they were looking at though we have to remember is that they were driving along a road and the highways were constructed in part as touristic landscapes And what do you find when you go out into the countryside You see billboard alleys that are lining the highways endlessly repeating one after another oftentimes in full color dramatic spectacular view with lights eliminating them if you were in a major city or on your way into a major city
And so I think that they really were amazing spectacles for people who embraced commerce But for the scenic sisters this was not a sense of a technologically sublime of commerce Right It was that the roadside vista is not this public space is not open to democratic access because billboards are turning into a physical and a conceptual blight They block the view
BRIAN It8217s a commercialized space
CATHERINE GUDIS Yeah It8217s a commercialized space But it8217s more than that I think it8217s more than that I think it8217s also that they8217re blocking the notion that the American landscape is held commonly that it doesn8217t have property borders that it8217s free to all And that8217s a conception of the view the view from the road right That we should all have access to that untrammeled view It should not be sullied by commerce
BRIAN This battle this goes on for decades of course Does the introduction of the Interstate Highway Act in the 821750s make a difference
CATHERINE GUDIS Oh it makes a huge difference Once the Federal Interstate Act is passed in 1956 the idea is that is this in a 25 billion investment going to be lined with commerce And who8217s going to be paying for that So as legislators are organizing around the Federal Interstate Act reformers are seeking to ensure that that whole expressway system coast to coast North to South is going to be protected from billboard advertising
So through the 821750s they continue their activities And then once Lyndon Johnson becomes president and despite the fact that he himself had advertised in his campaigns using billboards he comes forward as being on their side in part because his wife Lady Bird is really interested in beautification And she even pushes him to call the US Secretary of Commerce in 1964 to tell him to do something to clean up the road side
BRIAN Ah I remember that
CATHERINE GUDIS Interestingly we see the gender game being played out again even at that moment I mean it starts when Johnson says you know I love that woman referring to his wife and she wants that Highway Beautification Act By God we8217re going to get it for her And indeed8211
BRIAN He didn8217t call her the little lady did he
CATHERINE GUDIS He said you know I love that woman No he doesn8217t say a little lady He might as well have No So she begins to advocate And so he begins to meet with people to make this happen So they form some task forces on natural beauty and from there begin to craft the language that will ultimately be passed in 1965 as the Highway Beautification Act
BRIAN And does it work
CATHERINE GUDIS What finally passes as the Highway Beautification Act the reformers don8217t see as a triumph They see it as a failure in many ways because it doesn8217t just outright ban billboards It limits them It restricts them More than that for the billboards that were there the federal government and state governments are to pay the owners of the billboards to remove them
What they see is that this is going to be a continuing battle in which governmental and legislative forces favor industry But I have to say that in looking at photographs and comparing what the landscape scenes looked like if it8217s hard not to see it as actually having played a significant role that8217s interesting in a lot of ways Because instead of a lot a little signs lining the highways or the interstates as former in these corridors8211
BRIAN We see some very big ones now
CATHERINE GUDIS We see really big ones Yeah And so it becomes8211 for me I see it as metaphorical for the industry at large The industry itself consolidates the whole advertising industry not just outdoor advertising It consolidates It becomes something huge and unavoidable omniscient and omnipresent And I say both of those words for a reason
Advertisers now can chart where we are where we move what our preferences might be and tailor their advertisements to us And so the consolidation of space changes the look but it doesn8217t necessarily change the principle of advertising in public space and colonizing that space through commerce
BRIAN Cathy I just have to ask when your book came out were you tempted to advertise it on a big billboard
CATHERINE GUDIS Given another chance I think I might advertise my book on a billboard

									If you8217re just joining us this is BackStory and we8217re talking today about the history of advertising in America Peter Ed where did the advertising that I would recognize as advertising today where did that come from
PETER That would get you to buy something
BRIAN Exactly
PETER That8217d be some really good advertising
BRIAN Exactly
ED I would say that you8217d be surprised to think that it happened in the period that I specialize in
BRIAN No kidding
ED Here8217s what I would mean by that And I think the advertising that we would recognize as advertising is image rich right It is mass produced It is building a brand And I think that really evolves over the 19th century along with newspapers that can spread all that
And so you think about things like Ivory Soap They have the image that they still use today And they would have a slogan And the other things that they would have would be testimonials Because you8217re trying to build a personal connection between the consumer and a mass produced good
BRIAN So what8217s an example of a testimonial What kind of person would offer that
ED You know when it came time to bathe my new baby I wondered where I could find a soap that I knew would be safe for her gentle skin And I remember hearing that Ivory was 994 pure
BRIAN I got my credit card out already Ed
ED And I used Ivory8211
BRIAN That8217s really impressive
ED We don8217t take credit cards in the 19th century
BRIAN Oh darn
ED I appreciate the thought And after I bathed my baby she smelled so good And I knew that I would buy Ivory Soap again I hope you will too So that8217s my belief of what advertising that we would recognize as our own emerges And this really takes form in the late 19th century which makes me wonder how people actually bought stuff before that You know
PETER I want to tell you Ed they did And they did in a big way And I think the real challenge for us is to understand what it was that would get the attention of consumers Because I think that8217s what advertising is really about reaching out from producer to consumer or from merchandiser to the ultimate user And that begins well you might say from the beginning of time But in America I think what really is determinative is the spread of print
Because in a traditional culture where everybody knows everybody else and you know where you8217re going to get your horseshoes you know where you8217re going to get your flour in a customary world of these kind of intimate transactions advertising is unnecessary But what happens when you have long distances between the producer and the consumer What happens in urban centers like Philadelphia is that you have thanks to print and all the ways that print can indicate to consumers what8217s available simply listing things What I want to communicate to you guys is the sheer excitement of knowing what8217s in a shop
BRIAN So you8217re focusing on the medium that Ed kind of took for granted
PETER Yeah that8217s right And this is what I defy you to do is to try to imagine how reading a list of things could just rock your world
ED I remember the early days of the internet Peter It wasn8217t that hard
PETER That was the same thing wasn8217t it
BRIAN And who8217s placing these socalled ads
PETER OK you got the problem of inventory and turnover And you wait a long time to get a shipment of tea from Bohea or from wherever it is
BRIAN So you8217re talking about importers
PETER Yeah we8217re basically talking about importers because daytoday needs are satisfied in local markets But the cutting edge the leading edge of the market8211 what becomes the market revolution8211 the leading edge of consumption that8217s with imports So it could be something like tea It would be porcelain It could be textiles There are any number of things8211
BRIAN So people would see a list of China
PETER Yeah
BRIAN And get really worked up about it
PETER And the important thing to keep in mind8211 again something we take for granted8211 is to have advertising you have to have literacy Now you8217d say it is a broad literacy There8217s visual as well as conventional literacy But the American population is the most literate in the world with the possible exception of Sweden
BRIAN Right Because they really couldn8217t produce the kind of images that Ed might have in the late 19th century Like these really were word
PETER The image that would only work at a local market is a one off a painting that would hang in front of a tavern or something like that And that8217s important
ED Yeah
PETER But I want to emphasize the way that you can read into a word or a list of things pictures of goods I would say a word is worth a thousand pictures in this period You know we flip it around in the modern period to talk about all you can learn from a picture That8217s what really excites the desire of consumers is to know what they can get
BRIAN And did they buy more than they should have
PETER Well of course
BRIAN Or is that just a 20th century thing
PETER Of course You talk about credit cards We don8217t have those but we have credit And we have bankruptcies galore So merchants are eager to enable purchasing But in order to get the whole thing going to get the machinery working you8217ve got to make the fundamental connection It8217s an information problem It8217s getting information to consumers about what8217s on offer
ED So Brian you ask where advertising as we know it comes from They have surprisingly deep roots But it strikes me that the 20th century is in many ways kind of recycling things that we already knew from the 18th and 19th century right It8217s that people buy because of real or imagined personal connections to the product You know
And back in Peter8217s time it8217s the shopkeepers who can tell you hey I8217ve got these great things You8217d really want to buy this cloth Or in my time the testimonials whispering to you from the pages of newspaper It strikes me that radio television movies build upon that but maybe don8217t invent that much that8217s new
For the past few weeks we8217ve been inviting your ideas for advertising styles from the past that we might draw on to create ads for our own program So we got a lot of great suggestions And after blowing through our multimillion dollar advertising budget we are going to share with you today two of the ads that we decided to go ahead and produce The first was inspired by a request from listener Jim Mica in Ithaca New York

									MUSIC 8211 8220WHEATIES JINGLE8221
ED Have you tried Wheaties They8217re whole wheat with all of the bran That according to General Mills was the first ever commercial jingle broadcast in America It went out over Minneapolis airwaves on Christmas Eve 1926 And since it seemed to boost sales locally company execs made the song the headliner of a national campaign in a desperate attempt to save a dying brand Apparently it worked Wheaties sales skyrocketed And ever since the story goes jingles have been used to sell everything from used cars to community colleges
Here8217s a more recent jingle with a little more shall we say stickiness than that Wheaties tune had
MUSIC 8211 8220KIT KAT JINGLE8221
The long running Kit Kat candy jingle premiered in 1988 And since then it has achieved many millions of times over what every jingle is created to do8211 get stuck in your head on loop ad infinitum
MICHAEL LEVINE SINGING Give me a break And break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar
BRIAN This is Michael Levine a musician in LA And he8217s the one who8217s responsible for this insidious earworm of a jingle Over the course of his career Levine has composed music for more than 1500 ads But I gotta tell you that no ad enjoyed more success than that darn Kit Kat tune So I had to ask him how did he come up with that jingle in the first place
MICHAEL LEVINE Well I got a call from Chris  McHale  who was the music producer at Doyle Dane Bernbach who was the advertising agency handling the Kit Kat account for Hershey And they already had a campaign they were in love with And they had spent a fortune on it and got all sorts of famous people to sing on it and this and that But they needed what is called a cannon fodder campaign They needed something that the client could reject So they assigned their lowest ranking copywriter and their lowest ranking music supplier me8211 their the lowest ranking copywriter being Ken Schuldman8211 to come up with something for which they were going to pay us so little money that I didn8217t even have money to hire jingle singers
But first of all in terms of how it came about is Ken had written a whole lot of lyrics including 8220give me a break give me a break break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar8221 and the bridge of the song And I had it in my hand We talked a little bit about direction And I got into the elevator And by the time I was on the first floor I pretty much had the song
BRIAN Where did you start
MICHAEL LEVINE I believe it was the third floor
BRIAN Two whole floors for Kit Kat
MICHAEL LEVINE Yeah it was a slow elevator So at any rate we had so little money that we ended up Chris and his assistant Joe Barone and I sang the demo And the client loved it And one thing led to another It8217s a many faceted road after that But the fall out of it was that I ended up singing on the commercials for many years
And because of the way that the Screen Actors Guild contracts are structured which is how people who sing on television commercials or in SAG contracts I actually made more money as a singer than as the composer
BRIAN Well I8217m going to get metaphysical here What8217s your theory about what makes an earworm
MICHAEL LEVINE Well I really like when Malcolm Gladwell wrote about this And he alluded to a kind of wrongness It8217s the idea that there8217s something that is incomplete or out of place and your mind can8217t quite let it sit If something is really just perfectly tidy and ordered it8217s done Fine Your brain goes on to the next thing
To get all musicotechnical on you the first phrase is a pentatonic melody SINGING Give me a break
BRIAN Uhhuh
MICHAEL LEVINE That scale ascending has this very bright childish character But then the very next note is SINGING give me a break SPEAKING That is what musicians would call the dominant 7 or the flat seventh
BRIAN Right
MICHAEL LEVINE And it8217s kind of a dark note It comes from the blues And a lot of the contradiction that8217s embodied in blues and jazz comes from this mixture of dark and light
BRIAN So the general itself has a bit of ying and yang in it
MICHAEL LEVINE Absolutely
BRIAN The music The music
MICHAEL LEVINE And I think that most of the great ones do
BRIAN Very interesting Well you just showed off your chops as a serious composer And you8217ve also worked in film and television Does it ever bug you that some people know you as the guy who wrote the Kit Kat jingle
MICHAEL LEVINE No I8217m actually quite proud of this And I think that oftentimes there8217s this kind of artificial division between commerce and art And I8217ve always felt very comfortable in both worlds Maybe they really aren8217t different worlds
As an example Johann Sebastian Bach wrote this stack full of cantatas that are just beautiful some of our greatest musical heritage And he wrote them because he had a job He was a capellmeister That8217s a choir director And he had to come up with new material So that was what he was getting paid to do
And no I8217m not saying the Kit Kat jingle is on par with Back but I8217m as proud of it as I am of the serious pieces I8217ve written because it8217s still being used nearly 30 years after it was written I mean one of the things they told me back in the day was they actually had to build another plant to make more Kit Kats
BRIAN Wow
MICHAEL LEVINE So clearly it touched a lot of people
BRIAN Michael Levine is the composer of the long running 8220Give Me A Break8221 Kit Kat jingle He spoke to us from his studio in LA And before he said goodbye he told us that he had a little surprise for us Now you8217ll recall a little earlier in the show we mentioned that we8217ve been soliciting listener input for the production of historic sounding BackStory ads Well it turns out that Michael Levine had something ready for the cause something that to be perfectly honest we8217d be hard pressed to beat
MICHAEL LEVINE SINGING When my history is feeling kind of shallow I go get me more days of yore from Onuf Ayers and Balogh I get back to my BackStory Back to my BackStory But Wait Wait Don8217t Tell Me it just ain8217t fair that All Things Considered gets so much Fresh Air I8217ve been there I8217ve done that with Brian Lehrer I got to get back to my BackStory Back to my BackStory
PETER We need to take a short break but we8217ll be SINGING back with more of your BackStory in just a minute Don8217t even think about going away

									BRIAN SINGING I8217m back with your BackStory SPEAKING And I8217m still Brian Balogh
PETER And I8217m Peter Onuf
ED And I8217m Ed Ayers We8217re talking today about the history of advertising it in America
BRIAN In 1928 the American Tobacco Company had a problem Their Lucky Strike brands of cigarettes was one of the fastest growing in the United States But there was one totally untapped corner of the market8211 women Smoking at this time was still seen as a manly activity Many would have associated it with soldiers on the front lines of World War I for instance Women lighting up cigarettes that was relatively unheard of And socially it was certainly taboo
PETER To break this taboo American Tobacco turned to a man named Edward Bernays He was part ad man part PR guy and all ego In the 821720s Bernays had revolutionized the way products were sold in America Instead of direct advertising he used techniques lifted from his uncle Sigmund Freud to tap into the underlying reasons people had for making the choices they did
So when publishers for instance came to him to up their book sales he did more than just place ads in newspapers He convinced the leading architects of American homes to build bookshelves into the walls
LARRY TYE He figured a vacuum needs to be filled And if you had bookshelves in a home you weren8217t going to fill it with cereal boxes You were going to fill it with books
BRIAN This is author Larry Tye who wrote a biography of Bernays He says Bernays banked on Americans8217 desire to impress their friends with all the books they owned even if they had never cracked open any of those books on their shelves The result was huge sales for publishers
LARRY TYE So he took a very basic behavior and he transformed it to the point where every time I8217m in someone8217s home now and I see a builtin bookshelf I think that is Eddie Bernays
BRIAN American Tobacco most likely knew it would take this sort of outsideofthebox thinking to reshape Americans8217 associations with smoking And Bernays delivered the goods His first step was to enlist medical professionals They gave him quotes attesting to the health benefits of smoking particularly that it made women thinner
Then Bernays pushed those quotes to reporters But when I sat down with Tye he told me that journalists and doctors weren8217t the only ones that Bernays targeted in 1928
LARRY TYE He convinced a guy a photographer named Nicholas Murray to ask other photographers and artists to sing the praises of the thin And Murray said 8220I8217ve come to the conclusion that the slender woman who combining suppleness and grace with slenderness who instead of overeating sweets and desserts lights a cigarette has created a whole new standard female loveliness8221
And Bernays actually turned that into a slogan8211 8220reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet8221 And by doing that he was tapping into people who he knew helped set the trends in America So in this case it was a photographer In other cases it was nutritionists and health experts But to me the most symbolically wonderful and the most poetic of the ways he went to work was he decided to enlist some of the most extraordinary debutantes in New York society and got these women to sign up for what they thought was striking a blow not for smoking cigarettes but for women8217s liberation
On Easter Sunday marching down America8217s Boulevard which was Fifth Avenue he got them to light up what he called 8220their torches of freedom8221 So Easter Sunday Fifth Avenue America8217s leading debutantes lighting up their torches a freedom
BRIAN Brilliant But you know what if some competitor some knock off brand is capitalizing on all his good work Some competing tobacco company
LARRY TYE They did But he increased sales enough for the whole market And the people who were hiring him already had the lion8217s share of any market he was going into That it worked for them But Bernays actually decided that many women weren8217t smoking Luckies because the green package with the red bullseye clashed with their favorite clothing This was an extraordinary notion in two ways One that the choice of a cigarette would depend on how it went with your clothing was extraordinary enough More chutzpa was the notion that he could actually change the taste of women in terms of the color they preferred And he proceeded to do just that
BRIAN Unbelievable
LARRY TYE With Lucky Strikes he decided that they would go best if the color green8211 if women were wearing green And he helped make green the fashion color of the year He could change people8217s taste in everything from what they ate to what they wore And he used every technique that he ever tried in any other format to get women smoking cigarettes
BRIAN To stand up for Bernays as I recall he made the case that more propaganda which in those days in fairness really meant information would lead to more informed debate In other words both sides could have at it I remember those poor candy makers They weren8217t happy about the slim is better campaign And if I8217m not mistaken Bernays8217s attitude when they struck back at him was hey this is good This just creates more free publicity
LARRY TYE So you bring up a really important point Bernays8217s legacy was the best and the worst of what public relations and propaganda can be The best was getting more information out there educating the public He really did believe in an informed public The worst was that he didn8217t want to inform that public with really straight information He decided to educate the public with only the selected information that benefited his clients
BRIAN Did he use his products Did Bernays smoke
LARRY TYE He had never been tempted to smoke himself But at the very moment when he was having women march down Fifth Avenue with their torches of freedom he was telling his young daughters at home when they saw their mother smoking a cigarette to try to take the pack of cigarettes and8211 as he said8211 8220break them in half like they were brittle bones and flush them down the toilet8221 So 50 years later when he went to work for the American Lung Association trying to wean women off the habit he had created he said to America basically if I had known how dangerous this product was I would never have helped create the addiction to it
That would have been very convincing if he hadn8217t left behind in the Library of Congress all his own records showing just how he did know Tragically he ignored8211 and didn8217t just ignore8211 covered up the evidence And tragically we saw the result as women8217s rates of lung cancer in America started to catch up to men at the same time their rates of buying products from American Tobacco was catching up to men The question to me is why would he create these kinds of illusions and misapprehensions about what he was doing and then leave all the papers that prove that he was lying to the Library of Congress where some day somebody would look at them And my only answer to that is that he was old enough when he left the papers and there were so many of them that he might not have been aware of just how damning his own evidence was on his own lying
BRIAN Or perhaps he was even prouder of his ability to manipulate than of his moral compass
LARRY TYE I didn8217t think anybody could be more cynical about Eddie than I am But I think that you could absolutely be right
BRIAN Well Larry thank you for unspinning this truly complex figure in American history for us
LARRY TYE It8217s been great to be with you Thank you

									ED Our final story today is less about selling a product and more about generating support for an idea Put another way it8217s about public relations public relations for space travel
NEIL ARMSTRONG That8217s one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
ED This of course is audio from Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin8217s first stroll on the moon July 20 1969 Many of us remember that date What we don8217t tend to remember as well is how rapidly the space program took shape As late as 1949 a Gallup poll found that only 15 of Americans thought it possible that humans would set foot on the moon by the end of the century
BRIAN The program that made space travel a reality depended on getting Americans on board with the idea that well it could be a reality And that8217s where PR came in Richard Jurek is the coauthor of a new book called Marketing the Moon He says that the concept of manned space travel long a subject of science fiction made its debut in the nonfiction media in 1952 That8217s when Collier8217s Magazine launched a major series of graphically illustrated articles by scientists making the case that space travel was just around the corner
RICHARD JUREK After the Collier8217s publication support instantly jump up to 38
ED The first article in the Collier8217s series was written by a distinguish rocket scientist named Wernher Von Braun At that time in the employ at the US Military he quickly became something of a media darling
RICHARD JUREK And then in 1955 Von Braun partnered with Walt Disney of all people who was launching his Disneyland television show on TV
ED The very first episode was called 8220Man in Space8221 and like the Collier8217s articles made the case that space travel was well within our grasp
MALE SPEAKER 2 Here to introduce you to this new series is Walt Disney
WALT DISNEY One of a man8217s oldest dreams has been the desire for space travel to travel to other worlds Until recently this seemed to be an impossibility But great new discoveries have brought us to the threshold of a new frontier
RICHARD JUREK And Eisenhower saw this and the next day asked for a copy and showed it to everyone in the Pentagon And just two months later said that we will launch our first satellite in 821757 In 1958 NASA was formed And senators even thanked Disney on the floor of the Senate for what he helped to do to convince the politicians the military and the American public to start an ambitious space program which eventually led us going to the moon
BRIAN If public relations was key to launching NASA in the late 821750s it remained central to the agency8217s operations once it was airborne Today says Jurek it8217s easy to take for granted But considering the military backgrounds of many in the program it could just as easily have been that the Apollo program took shape in secret
RICHARD JUREK Under the military program8211 and many of the folks involved in NASA were on loan from the military8211 you could not discuss a project until there was what was called 8220fire in the tail8221 until the rocket was launching in the air NASA public affairs starting from Walter T Bonney the first head of Public Affairs all the way through Julian Scheer who ran it during the Apollo program they were all exjournalists who were deeply committed to the open program and who pushed to go beyond 8220fire in the tail8221 So that when Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the moon we saw it live and with no delay Compared to the closed military program of space travel in the Soviet Union and to what the US program was just a few short years before it was a phenomenal achievement
ED The pinnacle of NASA8217s public relations efforts was without a doubt the live televised broadcast from the Apollo missions Some 3000 journalist were on hand at Cape Canaveral for the launch of Armstrong8217s mission And NASA made a point of providing support for all of them But had it not been for the insistence of the PR guys Jurek says all of those historic moments could very easily have gone unrecorded
RICHARD JUREK Back in the 821760s cameras were huge They were heavy And the astronauts themselves many of them didn8217t want cameras aboard Because when you had threeperson crews going on board the commander didn8217t want his crew quote unquote 8220performing for the cameras8221 but focused on the mission And so there was this huge internal debate that went on between public affairs Washington the astronauts and others And thankfully television won out
MALE SPEAKER 3 Armstrong is on the moon Neil Armstrong 38yearold American standing on the surface of the moon
MALE SPEAKER 4 Well thank you television for letting us watch this one
MALE SPEAKER 3 This is something 240000 miles out there on the moon and we8217re seeing this
BRIAN 94 of Americans with a TV set watched at least part of the Apollo 11 broadcast in July of 1969 And never was public support for the space program higher For the first and only time in the 1960s a majority of Americans polled believe the lunar program was worth its enormous cost
But even as Armstrong and Aldrin were taking their first steps on the moon8217s surface NASA was already facing budget cuts and layoffs And it didn8217t take long before public support for the program started to wane as well
RICHARD JUREK The moment Buzz Aldrin declared it a magnificent desolation and the moment the astronauts brought back just a bag of rocks8211 there was no life there were no precious metals we couldn8217t mine it for oil when we discovered that the biggest thing was the rarity and the fragility of the earth we started to look inward
BRIAN The idea of a return trip to this dead rock became a tougher and tougher sell
ED And yet at the very same time that overall support for the space program was waning there was one group of Americans who saw it as a winning proposition one that was worth every cent Advertisers
RICHARD JUREK It was a program that every brand wanted to be associated with Even if you had nothing to do with the space program you want to imply it
MALE SPEAKER 5 When I volunteered for moon duty they said I could have anything I wanted So here I am alone with Trix the corn cereal with fruitflavored goodness
RICHARD JUREK When you at something as innocuous and iconic as something like Tang8211
MALE SPEAKER 6 The astronauts do some things you do In space they drank Tang They mixed it like this in a zeroG pouch because with no gravity it would fly all over
RICHARD JUREK Back in the day Tang was kind of a failed product for General Foods And it was only after it became known through General Foods marketing of Tang as a space food that it became a runaway best seller
MALE SPEAKER 6 Tang chosen for the Gemini astronauts Have a blast Have some Tang
ED Tang and Trix clearly benefited from their association with NASA But Jurek points out that food manufacturers weren8217t the only ones hitching themselves to the moon missions
RICHARD JUREK The Boeings and the Raytheons of the world who let8217s face it were caught up in the Vietnam War And it8217s kind of hard to be advertising your great missile that might be killing somebody But it8217s a lot easier to advertise your technological prowess when you8217re getting people to the moon and taking on a peaceful effort with the technology that you8217re creating and putting out into the marketplace
BRIAN Half a century on from the first lunar landing three in four Americans have a favorable view of NASA Nearly 23 of us believe astronauts will have landed on Mars by 2050 Yet most of us still don8217t want to pay what it would cost to get them there And funding for space exploration continues to be cut
ED But the vision championed by NASA8217s early public affairs department of an open very visible space program has flourished in the social media age Astronauts in the International Space Station point cameras at themselves
FEMALE SPEAKER 1 A lot of people ask me how I wash my hair in space And I thought I8217d show you how I do it
ED At their food
MALE SPEAKER 7 So in space normally we just eat the asparagus And then we eat the grits and keep things simple Otherwise they8217re just everywhere
ED And occasionally even serenade us back here on earth
MALE SPEAKER 8 SINGING Ground control to Major Tom Lock your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on

PETER A history of advertising today on BackStory Don8217t go away Major funding for BackStory is provided by an anonymous donor the University of Virginia the National Endowment for the Humanities the Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations
MALE SPEAKER 1 From the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities this is BackStory with the American History Guys
BRIAN Welcome to the show I8217m Brian Balogh
PETER I8217m Peter Onuf
ED And I8217m Ed Ayers Now if you8217re listening to this show on the radio you probably heard Peter do something a few minutes ago that we in the business refer to as a billboard It8217s at oneminute tease apparently effective for the rest of the show complete with highlights some big questions for the hour some catchy music And it8217s basically an attempt to razzle dazzle you in the sticking with us through the new break
Well that radio billboard has its roots in the preradio age And like a lot of what we talk about on BackStory it dates back to the last few decades of the 19th century
CATHERINE GUDIS There are banners There are posters for circuses and other celebrations
PETER This is Cathy Gudis a historian in California who has written about advertising8217s early days A lot of it centered on East Coast cities but had a certain Wild West sensibility to it Picture roving wagons covered with enormous ads itinerant men with sandwich boards or ads on their hats gangs of bill posters prowling in the streets with buckets of wheat paste and broadsides announcing all manner of products and events Everywhere you looked Gudis says somebody would be trying to razzle dazzle you into seeing the benefits of what they had to sell
CATHERINE GUDIS You might have a series of textbased handbills or theater programs They look like theater programs And they8217re slathered on the exteriors of the buildings at street level But then as you sort of almost look up the side of the building the ads become larger and more pictorial until you get to the top of the building where an electrically illuminated ad is outlined There8217s an image There are words spelled out And there8217s revolving color that just sort of creates an entire cityscape of commerce
ED Now it does make sense that advertisers in this era would focus on cities because dense populations meant that you got the most bang for your advertising buck But Gudis says there were countryscapes of commerce as well
CATHERINE GUDIS Right There8217s actually a description of a few people who really prided themselves on going into remote areas with their waders on and painting on a rock so a train that might be passing by would have this perfect vision of it
ED Whether they were painted on big illuminated signs in the city screaming at passing trains from trees and rocks in the country or filling the space between articles in local newspapers one type of ad appeared everywhere8211 ads for patent medicines
CATHERINE GUDIS You8217d learn of something like Buchu which was recommended for everything from syphilis to rheumatism Or you might have seen Jones8217 Tonic a sure cure for paralysis vertigo insomnia jim jams8211 don8217t ask me what jim jams were
PETER If the conditions these socalled medicines were curing seem mysterious their ingredients were even more so Sometimes these potions would contain opium morphine More often they would contain potent doses of grain alcohol One manufacturer boasted that8211 I8217m quoting8211 8220I can advertise dishwater and sell it just as well as an article of merit It is all in the advertising8221
ED On the back of this advertising patent medicine sales climbed from a total of round 35 million before the Civil War to 75 million by the turn of the century And there are two ways of looking at this On the one hand patent medicines put advertising on the map and showed that advertising in itself could be a profitable business A lot of the early ad agents got their start hocking patent medicine ads to newspaper and magazine printers
But on the other hand the shadiness of the whole patent medicine enterprise kind of tarred advertising and gave it a bad name It would take a whole new generation of advertisers with a whole new approach to advertising to really turn that story around
BRIAN Across America this weekend a lot of people are talking about football But as there always is on Super Bowl Sunday there is just as much excitement8211 if not more8211 about what8217s taking place off the field interstices of the big game the advertising So today on the show we8217re looking at advertising8217s history How did advertising move from the margins of respectability to the 180 billion industry that it is today And why is it that Americans today don8217t just tolerate advertising8217s ubiquity they actually celebrate it
ED We8217ll begin where we left off in the last couple of decades of the 19th century It was then that a handful of ad middleman started making a name for themselves as ad agents who could be trusted Now these weren8217t the flybynight guys of a few years earlier known for extorting as much as possible from publishers and advertisers alike These were guys with solid circulation figures clear fee structures and standards of what they would and wouldn8217t sell
So patent medicines were out And things like well soap we8217re in
PETER Oh yeah
ED So guys I8217ve got a magazine ad from this period that I want to share with you It8217s for Pears the famous English complexion soap and features the portrait of Henry Ward Beecher a kind of rock star preacher of the day with a kind of a mullet actually along with a supposed a quotation from Beecher extolling the virtues of this wonderful soap And it8217s typical of a lot of what was coming out of these early ad agencies Places like NW Ayer amp Son and J Walter Thompson were discovering that they were in the business of selling trust And their ads were all about convincing consumers that these products were trustworthy
PETER Uhhuh Right
ED So you have that image in your head
PETER Yep
ED Now consider this one It8217s also a soap ad8211 Woodbury Soap8211 but it8217s from a few decades later 1917 to be exact It8217s in full color A young woman lounges in a revealing dress A handsome man in a suit leans over her He8217s clasping her hand and kissing her neck The tagline running across the top of the page is simple 8220A skin you love to touch8221
So this seems pretty racy for 1911
KATHLEEN FRANZ Pretty sexy right
ED Yeah really
KATHLEEN FRANZ Yeah Some more conservative magazines wouldn8217t take this ad
ED This is Kathleen Franz She8217s a historian who8217s working on a new Smithsonian exhibit about the history of advertising And when I spoke to her she pointed out that there8217s something besides the raciness of this second ad that makes a groundbreaking And that8217s that there8217s hardly anything in it about soap itself
KATHLEEN FRANZ One of the things about the creator of this ad and why it8217s such a revolutionary ad is that it is moving very quickly into what the product can do for the consumer and how it will change their life It puts the product at the bottom of the ad not central to the ad It gives you a view of the consumer which is you right I mean this is completely aspirational
The product can bridge that gap between your working class status or lower middle class status and the achievement of an American dream which here is very represented by not only the beautiful clothing and the kind of wealth that exudes but also this kind of sexiness The message that the ad wants to give to you and wants you to believe in is that if you use this soap you8217ll be a more attractive person
ED So who8217s behind this ad It seems to me it8217s persuasive even 100 years later I believe she does attract men So who was the mastermind that realized this is the direction advertising should take
KATHLEEN FRANZ Well it was a woman named Helen Landsdowne Resor There are women in advertising in this period They are helping shape the new messaging that advertising is putting out this move really from telling you again about the product and what the product is and moving it to a more emotional appeal And that really sets modern advertising
So the interesting thing about Helen Resor is really that she8217s at the top of the company She8217s running the offices of J Walter Thompson one of the largest advertising agencies in the world with her husband8217s family She8217s really the creative side of the house And he8217s doing the business side And she8217s cultivating this sort of new type of emotionalbased advertising
ED I am struck by the fact that there would be a place for women in this as there had not been a place for women in any kind of industry before So how do you explain that Kathleen
KATHLEEN FRANZ I think women knew how to reach other women And the male advertisers who are running these companies begin to understand that especially in this period And so you know J Walter Thompson really had built its reputation on advertising in women8217s magazines They knew that women were the primary consumers of most products especially for the household so soaps things that are being mass produced at this time And they are responding to this emotional appeal
And Helen Landsdowne Resor she tailors the advertising to them She is saying it8217s OK for women to be sexy and that products can help with that And you sales numbers coming back is that it reportedly increased sales of this soap 1000 So when you have the marketing data back to say that these kinds of very womencentered approaches are working it8217s all the more reason to trust the women who are writing the ads
ED Kathleen France is a historian at American University She8217s one of the curators of an upcoming Smithsonian exhibition on the history of advertising in America
PETER It8217s time for a short break When we get back a master of musical jingles teaches us something about making history catchy
BRIAN You8217re listening to BackStory We8217ll be right back
PETER We8217re back with BackStory I8217m Peter Onuf
BRIAN I8217m Brian Balogh
ED And I8217m Ed Ayers Today on the show we8217re marking advertising8217s annual championship match the Super Bowl with an hour on the history of advertising in America We8217ve heard a little bit about the early days of the advertising industry in the first couple of decades the 20th century We8217re going to pick up our story now in the 1920s the point at which the industry hit the road
PETER In the 1920s Americans were falling in love with their cars Tens of millions of them were taking to the roads And where motorist went billboards quickly followed
Driving down the highway Americans would see row after row of horizontally spanning billboards just like we might see today Many of them were full of color and illuminated by electric lighting But that8217s not all The roads signs were also blanketed in a number of smaller and less professional ads tacked up on trees and poles
It was all largely unregulated Companies and the ad agents working for them could put up billboards wherever landowners would rent them space Before long the roadsides were crowded with commerce
BRIAN Historian Cathy Gudis who we heard from at the top of today8217s show has written about this early efflorescence of outdoor advertising and about the opposition that grew up alongside it She told me that women were very much the forefront of the movement that worked for decades to do away with these billboards
CATHERINE GUDIS I think it was in part springing from the municipal housekeeping movement of an earlier period This idea that women were responsible for civilizing the home and also had a knowledge of beauty and that they were somehow going to be keepers of the landscape too8211
BRIAN So who was supporting billboards
CATHERINE GUDIS Well the billboard boys of course
BRIAN The boys Billboard boys
CATHERINE GUDIS Well the women like to call them varyingly the boys of the barons I love the idea of the barons because it suggests that they are colonizing the landscape8211
BRIAN Yeah
CATHERINE GUDIS 8211taking it over with commercial advertising And they are I mean that8217s the goal It8217s partly because the industry becomes big and incorporates nationally and has a lobbying arm It8217s called the Outdoor Advertising Association of America
BRIAN It sounds so8211
CATHERINE GUDIS And they resented8211
BRIAN It sounds so pastoral
CATHERINE GUDIS Oh it8217s so pastoral It8217s not billboards Right It8217s not litter on a stick It8217s outdoor advertising
BRIAN No Litter on a stick All right So what do the barons call the women I don8217t want to know the locker room term But what do they call them in public
CATHERINE GUDIS The language that they use persistently is incredibly gendered They are these flowersniffing aesthetes with no concern Right The have no concern
BRIAN Flowersniffing no less
CATHERINE GUDIS Oh yeah Because this idea that they are aesthetes with no conception of the financial ramifications of being able to advertise across the American landscape
BRIAN Well how did these flowersniffing ladies socalled8211 what do they bring to the table How do they fight these guys who are a national industry
CATHERINE GUDIS They basically harness their powers through women8217s clubs and the garden clubs And so for instance this one woman named Elizabeth Lawton who is so impressive she organizes a group called the National Roadside Counsel And put it this way the outdoor industry disliked her to the extent that when I went through their files I found her information in a file that was labeled nuisances abated And on the top was her obituary
LAUGHTER
So she was definitely a thorn
BRIAN You8217re not suggesting foul play are you
CATHERINE GUDIS No foul play I really don8217t think there was foul play But I think she was just so annoying She annoyed them to no end The letter writing campaigns were out of control letters to the editor And they8217re mostly middle class women who were writing a lot of letters
BRIAN And what did these women want Did they want advertising to go away I mean what was their goal
CATHERINE GUDIS Yeah I mean I think that would8217ve been an ideal What they were looking at though we have to remember is that they were driving along a road and the highways were constructed in part as touristic landscapes And what do you find when you go out into the countryside You see billboard alleys that are lining the highways endlessly repeating one after another oftentimes in full color dramatic spectacular view with lights eliminating them if you were in a major city or on your way into a major city
And so I think that they really were amazing spectacles for people who embraced commerce But for the scenic sisters this was not a sense of a technologically sublime of commerce Right It was that the roadside vista is not this public space is not open to democratic access because billboards are turning into a physical and a conceptual blight They block the view
BRIAN It8217s a commercialized space
CATHERINE GUDIS Yeah It8217s a commercialized space But it8217s more than that I think it8217s more than that I think it8217s also that they8217re blocking the notion that the American landscape is held commonly that it doesn8217t have property borders that it8217s free to all And that8217s a conception of the view the view from the road right That we should all have access to that untrammeled view It should not be sullied by commerce
BRIAN This battle this goes on for decades of course Does the introduction of the Interstate Highway Act in the 821750s make a difference
CATHERINE GUDIS Oh it makes a huge difference Once the Federal Interstate Act is passed in 1956 the idea is that is this in a 25 billion investment going to be lined with commerce And who8217s going to be paying for that So as legislators are organizing around the Federal Interstate Act reformers are seeking to ensure that that whole expressway system coast to coast North to South is going to be protected from billboard advertising
So through the 821750s they continue their activities And then once Lyndon Johnson becomes president and despite the fact that he himself had advertised in his campaigns using billboards he comes forward as being on their side in part because his wife Lady Bird is really interested in beautification And she even pushes him to call the US Secretary of Commerce in 1964 to tell him to do something to clean up the road side
BRIAN Ah I remember that
CATHERINE GUDIS Interestingly we see the gender game being played out again even at that moment I mean it starts when Johnson says you know I love that woman referring to his wife and she wants that Highway Beautification Act By God we8217re going to get it for her And indeed8211
BRIAN He didn8217t call her the little lady did he
CATHERINE GUDIS He said you know I love that woman No he doesn8217t say a little lady He might as well have No So she begins to advocate And so he begins to meet with people to make this happen So they form some task forces on natural beauty and from there begin to craft the language that will ultimately be passed in 1965 as the Highway Beautification Act
BRIAN And does it work
CATHERINE GUDIS What finally passes as the Highway Beautification Act the reformers don8217t see as a triumph They see it as a failure in many ways because it doesn8217t just outright ban billboards It limits them It restricts them More than that for the billboards that were there the federal government and state governments are to pay the owners of the billboards to remove them
What they see is that this is going to be a continuing battle in which governmental and legislative forces favor industry But I have to say that in looking at photographs and comparing what the landscape scenes looked like if it8217s hard not to see it as actually having played a significant role that8217s interesting in a lot of ways Because instead of a lot a little signs lining the highways or the interstates as former in these corridors8211
BRIAN We see some very big ones now
CATHERINE GUDIS We see really big ones Yeah And so it becomes8211 for me I see it as metaphorical for the industry at large The industry itself consolidates the whole advertising industry not just outdoor advertising It consolidates It becomes something huge and unavoidable omniscient and omnipresent And I say both of those words for a reason
Advertisers now can chart where we are where we move what our preferences might be and tailor their advertisements to us And so the consolidation of space changes the look but it doesn8217t necessarily change the principle of advertising in public space and colonizing that space through commerce
BRIAN Cathy I just have to ask when your book came out were you tempted to advertise it on a big billboard
CATHERINE GUDIS Given another chance I think I might advertise my book on a billboard
BRIAN OK Well thank you for joining us on BackStory today
CATHERINE GUDIS Thank you for having me
MUSIC 8211 DEL REEVES 8220GIRL ON THE BILLBOARD8221
BRIAN Cathy Gudis is a historian at the University of California Riverside She8217s the author of Buyways8211 that would BUY ways8211 Billboards Automobiles and the American Landscape
If you8217re just joining us this is BackStory and we8217re talking today about the history of advertising in America Peter Ed where did the advertising that I would recognize as advertising today where did that come from
PETER That would get you to buy something
BRIAN Exactly
PETER That8217d be some really good advertising
BRIAN Exactly
ED I would say that you8217d be surprised to think that it happened in the period that I specialize in
BRIAN No kidding
ED Here8217s what I would mean by that And I think the advertising that we would recognize as advertising is image rich right It is mass produced It is building a brand And I think that really evolves over the 19th century along with newspapers that can spread all that
And so you think about things like Ivory Soap They have the image that they still use today And they would have a slogan And the other things that they would have would be testimonials Because you8217re trying to build a personal connection between the consumer and a mass produced good
BRIAN So what8217s an example of a testimonial What kind of person would offer that
ED You know when it came time to bathe my new baby I wondered where I could find a soap that I knew would be safe for her gentle skin And I remember hearing that Ivory was 994 pure
BRIAN I got my credit card out already Ed
ED And I used Ivory8211
BRIAN That8217s really impressive
ED We don8217t take credit cards in the 19th century
BRIAN Oh darn
ED I appreciate the thought And after I bathed my baby she smelled so good And I knew that I would buy Ivory Soap again I hope you will too So that8217s my belief of what advertising that we would recognize as our own emerges And this really takes form in the late 19th century which makes me wonder how people actually bought stuff before that You know
PETER I want to tell you Ed they did And they did in a big way And I think the real challenge for us is to understand what it was that would get the attention of consumers Because I think that8217s what advertising is really about reaching out from producer to consumer or from merchandiser to the ultimate user And that begins well you might say from the beginning of time But in America I think what really is determinative is the spread of print
Because in a traditional culture where everybody knows everybody else and you know where you8217re going to get your horseshoes you know where you8217re going to get your flour in a customary world of these kind of intimate transactions advertising is unnecessary But what happens when you have long distances between the producer and the consumer What happens in urban centers like Philadelphia is that you have thanks to print and all the ways that print can indicate to consumers what8217s available simply listing things What I want to communicate to you guys is the sheer excitement of knowing what8217s in a shop
BRIAN So you8217re focusing on the medium that Ed kind of took for granted
PETER Yeah that8217s right And this is what I defy you to do is to try to imagine how reading a list of things could just rock your world
ED I remember the early days of the internet Peter It wasn8217t that hard
PETER That was the same thing wasn8217t it
BRIAN And who8217s placing these socalled ads
PETER OK you got the problem of inventory and turnover And you wait a long time to get a shipment of tea from Bohea or from wherever it is
BRIAN So you8217re talking about importers
PETER Yeah we8217re basically talking about importers because daytoday needs are satisfied in local markets But the cutting edge the leading edge of the market8211 what becomes the market revolution8211 the leading edge of consumption that8217s with imports So it could be something like tea It would be porcelain It could be textiles There are any number of things8211
BRIAN So people would see a list of China
PETER Yeah
BRIAN And get really worked up about it
PETER And the important thing to keep in mind8211 again something we take for granted8211 is to have advertising you have to have literacy Now you8217d say it is a broad literacy There8217s visual as well as conventional literacy But the American population is the most literate in the world with the possible exception of Sweden
BRIAN Right Because they really couldn8217t produce the kind of images that Ed might have in the late 19th century Like these really were word
PETER The image that would only work at a local market is a one off a painting that would hang in front of a tavern or something like that And that8217s important
ED Yeah
PETER But I want to emphasize the way that you can read into a word or a list of things pictures of goods I would say a word is worth a thousand pictures in this period You know we flip it around in the modern period to talk about all you can learn from a picture That8217s what really excites the desire of consumers is to know what they can get
BRIAN And did they buy more than they should have
PETER Well of course
BRIAN Or is that just a 20th century thing
PETER Of course You talk about credit cards We don8217t have those but we have credit And we have bankruptcies galore So merchants are eager to enable purchasing But in order to get the whole thing going to get the machinery working you8217ve got to make the fundamental connection It8217s an information problem It8217s getting information to consumers about what8217s on offer
ED So Brian you ask where advertising as we know it comes from They have surprisingly deep roots But it strikes me that the 20th century is in many ways kind of recycling things that we already knew from the 18th and 19th century right It8217s that people buy because of real or imagined personal connections to the product You know
And back in Peter8217s time it8217s the shopkeepers who can tell you hey I8217ve got these great things You8217d really want to buy this cloth Or in my time the testimonials whispering to you from the pages of newspaper It strikes me that radio television movies build upon that but maybe don8217t invent that much that8217s new
For the past few weeks we8217ve been inviting your ideas for advertising styles from the past that we might draw on to create ads for our own program So we got a lot of great suggestions And after blowing through our multimillion dollar advertising budget we are going to share with you today two of the ads that we decided to go ahead and produce The first was inspired by a request from listener Jim Mica in Ithaca New York

MUSIC 8211 8220WHEATIES JINGLE8221
ED Have you tried Wheaties They8217re whole wheat with all of the bran That according to General Mills was the first ever commercial jingle broadcast in America It went out over Minneapolis airwaves on Christmas Eve 1926 And since it seemed to boost sales locally company execs made the song the headliner of a national campaign in a desperate attempt to save a dying brand Apparently it worked Wheaties sales skyrocketed And ever since the story goes jingles have been used to sell everything from used cars to community colleges
Here8217s a more recent jingle with a little more shall we say stickiness than that Wheaties tune had
MUSIC 8211 8220KIT KAT JINGLE8221
The long running Kit Kat candy jingle premiered in 1988 And since then it has achieved many millions of times over what every jingle is created to do8211 get stuck in your head on loop ad infinitum
MICHAEL LEVINE SINGING Give me a break And break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar
BRIAN This is Michael Levine a musician in LA And he8217s the one who8217s responsible for this insidious earworm of a jingle Over the course of his career Levine has composed music for more than 1500 ads But I gotta tell you that no ad enjoyed more success than that darn Kit Kat tune So I had to ask him how did he come up with that jingle in the first place
MICHAEL LEVINE Well I got a call from Chris  McHale  who was the music producer at Doyle Dane Bernbach who was the advertising agency handling the Kit Kat account for Hershey And they already had a campaign they were in love with And they had spent a fortune on it and got all sorts of famous people to sing on it and this and that But they needed what is called a cannon fodder campaign They needed something that the client could reject So they assigned their lowest ranking copywriter and their lowest ranking music supplier me8211 their the lowest ranking copywriter being Ken Schuldman8211 to come up with something for which they were going to pay us so little money that I didn8217t even have money to hire jingle singers
But first of all in terms of how it came about is Ken had written a whole lot of lyrics including 8220give me a break give me a break break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar8221 and the bridge of the song And I had it in my hand We talked a little bit about direction And I got into the elevator And by the time I was on the first floor I pretty much had the song
BRIAN Where did you start
MICHAEL LEVINE I believe it was the third floor
BRIAN Two whole floors for Kit Kat
MICHAEL LEVINE Yeah it was a slow elevator So at any rate we had so little money that we ended up Chris and his assistant Joe Barone and I sang the demo And the client loved it And one thing led to another It8217s a many faceted road after that But the fall out of it was that I ended up singing on the commercials for many years
And because of the way that the Screen Actors Guild contracts are structured which is how people who sing on television commercials or in SAG contracts I actually made more money as a singer than as the composer
BRIAN Well I8217m going to get metaphysical here What8217s your theory about what makes an earworm
MICHAEL LEVINE Well I really like when Malcolm Gladwell wrote about this And he alluded to a kind of wrongness It8217s the idea that there8217s something that is incomplete or out of place and your mind can8217t quite let it sit If something is really just perfectly tidy and ordered it8217s done Fine Your brain goes on to the next thing
To get all musicotechnical on you the first phrase is a pentatonic melody SINGING Give me a break
BRIAN Uhhuh
MICHAEL LEVINE That scale ascending has this very bright childish character But then the very next note is SINGING give me a break SPEAKING That is what musicians would call the dominant 7 or the flat seventh
BRIAN Right
MICHAEL LEVINE And it8217s kind of a dark note It comes from the blues And a lot of the contradiction that8217s embodied in blues and jazz comes from this mixture of dark and light
BRIAN So the general itself has a bit of ying and yang in it
MICHAEL LEVINE Absolutely
BRIAN The music The music
MICHAEL LEVINE And I think that most of the great ones do
BRIAN Very interesting Well you just showed off your chops as a serious composer And you8217ve also worked in film and television Does it ever bug you that some people know you as the guy who wrote the Kit Kat jingle
MICHAEL LEVINE No I8217m actually quite proud of this And I think that oftentimes there8217s this kind of artificial division between commerce and art And I8217ve always felt very comfortable in both worlds Maybe they really aren8217t different worlds
As an example Johann Sebastian Bach wrote this stack full of cantatas that are just beautiful some of our greatest musical heritage And he wrote them because he had a job He was a capellmeister That8217s a choir director And he had to come up with new material So that was what he was getting paid to do
And no I8217m not saying the Kit Kat jingle is on par with Back but I8217m as proud of it as I am of the serious pieces I8217ve written because it8217s still being used nearly 30 years after it was written I mean one of the things they told me back in the day was they actually had to build another plant to make more Kit Kats
BRIAN Wow
MICHAEL LEVINE So clearly it touched a lot of people
BRIAN Michael Levine is the composer of the long running 8220Give Me A Break8221 Kit Kat jingle He spoke to us from his studio in LA And before he said goodbye he told us that he had a little surprise for us Now you8217ll recall a little earlier in the show we mentioned that we8217ve been soliciting listener input for the production of historic sounding BackStory ads Well it turns out that Michael Levine had something ready for the cause something that to be perfectly honest we8217d be hard pressed to beat
MICHAEL LEVINE SINGING When my history is feeling kind of shallow I go get me more days of yore from Onuf Ayers and Balogh I get back to my BackStory Back to my BackStory But Wait Wait Don8217t Tell Me it just ain8217t fair that All Things Considered gets so much Fresh Air I8217ve been there I8217ve done that with Brian Lehrer I got to get back to my BackStory Back to my BackStory
PETER We need to take a short break but we8217ll be SINGING back with more of your BackStory in just a minute Don8217t even think about going away
BRIAN SINGING I8217m back with your BackStory SPEAKING And I8217m still Brian Balogh
PETER And I8217m Peter Onuf
ED And I8217m Ed Ayers We8217re talking today about the history of advertising it in America
BRIAN In 1928 the American Tobacco Company had a problem Their Lucky Strike brands of cigarettes was one of the fastest growing in the United States But there was one totally untapped corner of the market8211 women Smoking at this time was still seen as a manly activity Many would have associated it with soldiers on the front lines of World War I for instance Women lighting up cigarettes that was relatively unheard of And socially it was certainly taboo
PETER To break this taboo American Tobacco turned to a man named Edward Bernays He was part ad man part PR guy and all ego In the 821720s Bernays had revolutionized the way products were sold in America Instead of direct advertising he used techniques lifted from his uncle Sigmund Freud to tap into the underlying reasons people had for making the choices they did
So when publishers for instance came to him to up their book sales he did more than just place ads in newspapers He convinced the leading architects of American homes to build bookshelves into the walls
LARRY TYE He figured a vacuum needs to be filled And if you had bookshelves in a home you weren8217t going to fill it with cereal boxes You were going to fill it with books
BRIAN This is author Larry Tye who wrote a biography of Bernays He says Bernays banked on Americans8217 desire to impress their friends with all the books they owned even if they had never cracked open any of those books on their shelves The result was huge sales for publishers
LARRY TYE So he took a very basic behavior and he transformed it to the point where every time I8217m in someone8217s home now and I see a builtin bookshelf I think that is Eddie Bernays
BRIAN American Tobacco most likely knew it would take this sort of outsideofthebox thinking to reshape Americans8217 associations with smoking And Bernays delivered the goods His first step was to enlist medical professionals They gave him quotes attesting to the health benefits of smoking particularly that it made women thinner
Then Bernays pushed those quotes to reporters But when I sat down with Tye he told me that journalists and doctors weren8217t the only ones that Bernays targeted in 1928
LARRY TYE He convinced a guy a photographer named Nicholas Murray to ask other photographers and artists to sing the praises of the thin And Murray said 8220I8217ve come to the conclusion that the slender woman who combining suppleness and grace with slenderness who instead of overeating sweets and desserts lights a cigarette has created a whole new standard female loveliness8221
And Bernays actually turned that into a slogan8211 8220reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet8221 And by doing that he was tapping into people who he knew helped set the trends in America So in this case it was a photographer In other cases it was nutritionists and health experts But to me the most symbolically wonderful and the most poetic of the ways he went to work was he decided to enlist some of the most extraordinary debutantes in New York society and got these women to sign up for what they thought was striking a blow not for smoking cigarettes but for women8217s liberation
On Easter Sunday marching down America8217s Boulevard which was Fifth Avenue he got them to light up what he called 8220their torches of freedom8221 So Easter Sunday Fifth Avenue America8217s leading debutantes lighting up their torches a freedom
BRIAN Brilliant But you know what if some competitor some knock off brand is capitalizing on all his good work Some competing tobacco company
LARRY TYE They did But he increased sales enough for the whole market And the people who were hiring him already had the lion8217s share of any market he was going into That it worked for them But Bernays actually decided that many women weren8217t smoking Luckies because the green package with the red bullseye clashed with their favorite clothing This was an extraordinary notion in two ways One that the choice of a cigarette would depend on how it went with your clothing was extraordinary enough More chutzpa was the notion that he could actually change the taste of women in terms of the color they preferred And he proceeded to do just that
BRIAN Unbelievable
LARRY TYE With Lucky Strikes he decided that they would go best if the color green8211 if women were wearing green And he helped make green the fashion color of the year He could change people8217s taste in everything from what they ate to what they wore And he used every technique that he ever tried in any other format to get women smoking cigarettes
BRIAN To stand up for Bernays as I recall he made the case that more propaganda which in those days in fairness really meant information would lead to more informed debate In other words both sides could have at it I remember those poor candy makers They weren8217t happy about the slim is better campaign And if I8217m not mistaken Bernays8217s attitude when they struck back at him was hey this is good This just creates more free publicity
LARRY TYE So you bring up a really important point Bernays8217s legacy was the best and the worst of what public relations and propaganda can be The best was getting more information out there educating the public He really did believe in an informed public The worst was that he didn8217t want to inform that public with really straight information He decided to educate the public with only the selected information that benefited his clients
BRIAN Did he use his products Did Bernays smoke
LARRY TYE He had never been tempted to smoke himself But at the very moment when he was having women march down Fifth Avenue with their torches of freedom he was telling his young daughters at home when they saw their mother smoking a cigarette to try to take the pack of cigarettes and8211 as he said8211 8220break them in half like they were brittle bones and flush them down the toilet8221 So 50 years later when he went to work for the American Lung Association trying to wean women off the habit he had created he said to America basically if I had known how dangerous this product was I would never have helped create the addiction to it
That would have been very convincing if he hadn8217t left behind in the Library of Congress all his own records showing just how he did know Tragically he ignored8211 and didn8217t just ignore8211 covered up the evidence And tragically we saw the result as women8217s rates of lung cancer in America started to catch up to men at the same time their rates of buying products from American Tobacco was catching up to men The question to me is why would he create these kinds of illusions and misapprehensions about what he was doing and then leave all the papers that prove that he was lying to the Library of Congress where some day somebody would look at them And my only answer to that is that he was old enough when he left the papers and there were so many of them that he might not have been aware of just how damning his own evidence was on his own lying
BRIAN Or perhaps he was even prouder of his ability to manipulate than of his moral compass
LARRY TYE I didn8217t think anybody could be more cynical about Eddie than I am But I think that you could absolutely be right
BRIAN Well Larry thank you for unspinning this truly complex figure in American history for us
LARRY TYE It8217s been great to be with you Thank you
BRIAN Larry Tye is the author of The Father of Spin Edward L Bernays and the Birth of Public Relations
MUSIC 8211 PATSY CLINE 8220THREE CIGARETTES IN THE ASHTRAY8221
CAMERON Hi My name is Cameron I8217m calling from Regina Saskatchewan And I8217d love to see an ad in the style of the midcentury cigarette ad including health advice from a doctor about the positive benefits of listening to BackStory Bye
MALE SPEAKER 1 Hello folks Has the modern world become overwhelming Are the choices in podcasts and radio boggling your mind Making your head hurt Well the wonders of modern science can address that
I8217m in the lab there with Dr Kenneth Johnson Dr Johnson what have you been working on
DR KENNETH JOHNSON Well using the power of modern science we have been able to extract white noise and confusion away from audio
MALE SPEAKER 1 Oh I do hate white noise and confusion I simply don8217t have time to consider all things
LAUGHTER
DR KENNETH JOHNSON Yes Well now we have an audio condenser we call the contextor So you get more background and a deeper knowledge without all the junk The product is a smoother clearer sound that8217s healthier for you We call it BackStory
MALE SPEAKER 1 BackStory I like the sound of that Say let me have a taste Wow That is smoother on the ears Is it really true that BackStory will make you smarter and thinner using this contextor
DR KENNETH JOHNSON Oh yes Medical studies have proven it
MALE SPEAKER 1 Well that8217s all I need to know So remember folks for a deeper smoother and clearer take on life use BackStory on your local public radio station or wherever you get your podcasts
ED Our final story today is less about selling a product and more about generating support for an idea Put another way it8217s about public relations public relations for space travel
NEIL ARMSTRONG That8217s one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
ED This of course is audio from Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin8217s first stroll on the moon July 20 1969 Many of us remember that date What we don8217t tend to remember as well is how rapidly the space program took shape As late as 1949 a Gallup poll found that only 15 of Americans thought it possible that humans would set foot on the moon by the end of the century
BRIAN The program that made space travel a reality depended on getting Americans on board with the idea that well it could be a reality And that8217s where PR came in Richard Jurek is the coauthor of a new book called Marketing the Moon He says that the concept of manned space travel long a subject of science fiction made its debut in the nonfiction media in 1952 That8217s when Collier8217s Magazine launched a major series of graphically illustrated articles by scientists making the case that space travel was just around the corner
RICHARD JUREK After the Collier8217s publication support instantly jump up to 38
ED The first article in the Collier8217s series was written by a distinguish rocket scientist named Wernher Von Braun At that time in the employ at the US Military he quickly became something of a media darling
RICHARD JUREK And then in 1955 Von Braun partnered with Walt Disney of all people who was launching his Disneyland television show on TV
ED The very first episode was called 8220Man in Space8221 and like the Collier8217s articles made the case that space travel was well within our grasp
MALE SPEAKER 2 Here to introduce you to this new series is Walt Disney
WALT DISNEY One of a man8217s oldest dreams has been the desire for space travel to travel to other worlds Until recently this seemed to be an impossibility But great new discoveries have brought us to the threshold of a new frontier
RICHARD JUREK And Eisenhower saw this and the next day asked for a copy and showed it to everyone in the Pentagon And just two months later said that we will launch our first satellite in 821757 In 1958 NASA was formed And senators even thanked Disney on the floor of the Senate for what he helped to do to convince the politicians the military and the American public to start an ambitious space program which eventually led us going to the moon
BRIAN If public relations was key to launching NASA in the late 821750s it remained central to the agency8217s operations once it was airborne Today says Jurek it8217s easy to take for granted But considering the military backgrounds of many in the program it could just as easily have been that the Apollo program took shape in secret
RICHARD JUREK Under the military program8211 and many of the folks involved in NASA were on loan from the military8211 you could not discuss a project until there was what was called 8220fire in the tail8221 until the rocket was launching in the air NASA public affairs starting from Walter T Bonney the first head of Public Affairs all the way through Julian Scheer who ran it during the Apollo program they were all exjournalists who were deeply committed to the open program and who pushed to go beyond 8220fire in the tail8221 So that when Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the moon we saw it live and with no delay Compared to the closed military program of space travel in the Soviet Union and to what the US program was just a few short years before it was a phenomenal achievement
ED The pinnacle of NASA8217s public relations efforts was without a doubt the live televised broadcast from the Apollo missions Some 3000 journalist were on hand at Cape Canaveral for the launch of Armstrong8217s mission And NASA made a point of providing support for all of them But had it not been for the insistence of the PR guys Jurek says all of those historic moments could very easily have gone unrecorded
RICHARD JUREK Back in the 821760s cameras were huge They were heavy And the astronauts themselves many of them didn8217t want cameras aboard Because when you had threeperson crews going on board the commander didn8217t want his crew quote unquote 8220performing for the cameras8221 but focused on the mission And so there was this huge internal debate that went on between public affairs Washington the astronauts and others And thankfully television won out
MALE SPEAKER 3 Armstrong is on the moon Neil Armstrong 38yearold American standing on the surface of the moon
MALE SPEAKER 4 Well thank you television for letting us watch this one
MALE SPEAKER 3 This is something 240000 miles out there on the moon and we8217re seeing this
BRIAN 94 of Americans with a TV set watched at least part of the Apollo 11 broadcast in July of 1969 And never was public support for the space program higher For the first and only time in the 1960s a majority of Americans polled believe the lunar program was worth its enormous cost
But even as Armstrong and Aldrin were taking their first steps on the moon8217s surface NASA was already facing budget cuts and layoffs And it didn8217t take long before public support for the program started to wane as well
RICHARD JUREK The moment Buzz Aldrin declared it a magnificent desolation and the moment the astronauts brought back just a bag of rocks8211 there was no life there were no precious metals we couldn8217t mine it for oil when we discovered that the biggest thing was the rarity and the fragility of the earth we started to look inward
BRIAN The idea of a return trip to this dead rock became a tougher and tougher sell
ED And yet at the very same time that overall support for the space program was waning there was one group of Americans who saw it as a winning proposition one that was worth every cent Advertisers
RICHARD JUREK It was a program that every brand wanted to be associated with Even if you had nothing to do with the space program you want to imply it
MALE SPEAKER 5 When I volunteered for moon duty they said I could have anything I wanted So here I am alone with Trix the corn cereal with fruitflavored goodness
RICHARD JUREK When you at something as innocuous and iconic as something like Tang8211
MALE SPEAKER 6 The astronauts do some things you do In space they drank Tang They mixed it like this in a zeroG pouch because with no gravity it would fly all over
RICHARD JUREK Back in the day Tang was kind of a failed product for General Foods And it was only after it became known through General Foods marketing of Tang as a space food that it became a runaway best seller
MALE SPEAKER 6 Tang chosen for the Gemini astronauts Have a blast Have some Tang
ED Tang and Trix clearly benefited from their association with NASA But Jurek points out that food manufacturers weren8217t the only ones hitching themselves to the moon missions
RICHARD JUREK The Boeings and the Raytheons of the world who let8217s face it were caught up in the Vietnam War And it8217s kind of hard to be advertising your great missile that might be killing somebody But it8217s a lot easier to advertise your technological prowess when you8217re getting people to the moon and taking on a peaceful effort with the technology that you8217re creating and putting out into the marketplace
BRIAN Half a century on from the first lunar landing three in four Americans have a favorable view of NASA Nearly 23 of us believe astronauts will have landed on Mars by 2050 Yet most of us still don8217t want to pay what it would cost to get them there And funding for space exploration continues to be cut
ED But the vision championed by NASA8217s early public affairs department of an open very visible space program has flourished in the social media age Astronauts in the International Space Station point cameras at themselves
FEMALE SPEAKER 1 A lot of people ask me how I wash my hair in space And I thought I8217d show you how I do it
ED At their food
MALE SPEAKER 7 So in space normally we just eat the asparagus And then we eat the grits and keep things simple Otherwise they8217re just everywhere
ED And occasionally even serenade us back here on earth
MALE SPEAKER 8 SINGING Ground control to Major Tom Lock your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on
ED It may be YouTube not narrated live by Walter Cronkite for a TV audience of millions But these days what is
MALE SPEAKER 8 SINGING Commencing countdown engines on
