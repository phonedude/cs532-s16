Super Bowl 50 Carolina Panthers vs Denver Broncos
When 630 PM ET Sunday February 7 2016
Where Levis Stadium Santa Clara California
If you are a sports writer or a fan or a gambler we all rely on tons of statistical information accumulated daily weekly and seasonal We then evaluate every piece of statistical data on each team and every individual Finally we make an interpretation and then we flip a coin No but seriously we make what we think is a sensible and logical selection
However we forget to analyze the core of each game which is the human factor both as a team and as a player You see every statistic should coincide with the teams and players capabilities and techniques and most important intelligence to perform in crucial circumstance to execute automatically
We as a society see athletes as making tons of money and living large but there is another side of their lives we tend to overlook which is sacrificing their personal lives for the love of the sport The definition of the word athlete a person who is trained or skilled in exercises sports or games requiring physical strength agility or stamina
Lets take a look at a personal life of Carolinas Tight End Greg Olsen 3 years ago when the Panthers tight end and his wife had twins one of them had a rare heart defect Doctors weren8217t sure if TJ could even survive the delivery He spent 35 days in the hospital Imagine Olsen training and then playing every week while part of Olsens mind is on his son TJ
The point is from Owners to Coaches and Players to Trainers besides giving their full attention to this sport they always have to deal with a personal situation and each issue effects each other one way or another Some of the bigger issues do affect the line during the day and the power rating weekly
Peyton Manning8217s job on Sunday will be to not lose the game for the Broncos He8217s done a nice job at that the past 2 games throwing 0 INTs and taking just 4 sacks The task will be much tougher vs Carolina though The Panthers finished the regular season 5th in sacks and 1st in INTs
CJ Anderson has continued to easily outperform backfield mate Ronnie Hillman this postseason averaging 46 yards per carry to Hillman8217s 20 Last game also marked the 1st time since Week 12 that Anderson outcarried Hillman Expect Anderson to lead the way again in Sunday8217s Super Bowl The Panthers though limited RBs to just 38 yards per carry during the regular season and have held Marshawn Lynch and David Johnson to 38 over the last 2 games
Demaryius Thomas runs only about 20 of his routes from the slot and the guess here is that he8217ll see elite CB Josh Norman the majority of the time he8217s outside the numbers Thomas has struggled in easier matchups the past 2 games totaling just 6 catches for 52 scoreless yards We can8217t know exactly how Carolina will deploy All Pro CB Josh Norman but the prediction here is that he8217ll spend more time on the bigger more physically gifted Demaryius Thomas Of course Sanders has been Denver8217s best WR this postseason racking up 10 catches for 147 yards in 2 games
The Broncos allowed the fewest points to QBs in the regular season and have given up just 1 total TD to Ben Roethlisberger and Tom Brady in 2 playoff games Denver8217s elite CB trio holds a big edge over Carolina8217s WRs Newton will need to lean on his legs and TE Greg Olsen to move the ball on Sunday The Broncos were just smoked by TE Rob Gronkowski
While they didn8217t face a true running QB this year they did allow 30 rushing yards to Aaron Rodgers Andrew Luck and Alex Smith Jonathan Stewart has carried 19 times in 10 straight healthy games That includes outings of 191062 and 1983 in playoff wins over the Seahawks and Cardinals That8217s 50 yards per carry against a pair of defenses that rank among the top 7 in yards per carry allowed
The sledding doesn8217t get any easier in the Super Bowl though Denver led the league by giving up just 33 yards per carry during the regular season and has yielded just 36 in 2 playoff games Olsen represents the only edge the Panthers pass offense has vs the Broncos pass defense Denver finished the regular season 20th in points allowed to TEs and just gave up an 81441 line to Rob Gronkowski Olsen rolls into the Super Bowl with 12 catches for 190 yards and a score over his last 2 outings
Looking for a second opinion Have a look at what thejoeberra has to say in his Super Bowl 50  What Side Are You On article
Selection Denver 55
