The crowd didnt need to be told to clap in Bedford and Bush even started the event late to greet several dozen voters who werent able to fit into the crowded auditorium In the meantime he was preceded on stage by his son George P Bush and former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge after previous Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham opened the eventIt was Ridge who set the tone that would carry throughout the event when he called on voters to come together to elect George Bush before quickly correcting himselfIndeed Bush himself struck a neoconservative tone particularly reminiscent of his brothers posturing throughout two terms in the White HouseEvery day that we contain ISIS they win he declared We need to destroy ISIS rather than contain itAt the same time however the former governor offered up a more measured version of the neoconservatism of old dismissingnbspthe worldview of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders just as quickly as he derided TrumpSaying youre going to bomb the SHblankblank out of ISIS he offered incredulously of Trump Is that a serious thoughtBut more than anything else the conversation returned to Bushs experienceIn response to question after question he used his time in Tallahassee to frame his approach to the problems of today Most frequently Bush returned to his old refrains about civil service reform and his refusal to sign legislation that earned him the moniker Veto Corleone while in officeWhen people give me money he explained in response to a question about campaign finance they know my record  I was an equalopportunity vetoerWith the nations first primary looming on Tuesday Bush is desperately in need of a strong finish to bounce back from a three percent result in Iowa last weekBut even his own backers didnt seem to think he can pull it offHe doesnt light up a room said Henry Kinich a Bush supporter who predicted the former governor might be able to inch his way up into third placeIn the end it didnt seem like Bush seemed to think all that much of his chances eitherI dont give a youknowwhat about whether Im popular or not he said while discussing reforms to the Veterans Administration Because that is fleetingAnd that point may have rung truer for his campaign than he intended Woven throughout his stump speech and responses to voters were calls for optimism civility and reflection but rarely a call for supportInstead of making the case for people to vote for him Bush and his surrogates instead seemed to be fighting to define who he is  and countermanding the impressions his opponents have been able to build of himThe Bush thing people are just going to have to get over it he said near the end of the town hallI am who I amWilliam Snow contributed reporting to this article
