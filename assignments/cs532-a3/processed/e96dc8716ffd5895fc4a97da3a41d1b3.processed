GPLUS   Fancred  0 Comments         In Super Bowl 50 to see Greg Olsen make it to the big game is a great accomplishment Playing his first Super Bowl in his nine year careernbspmeans you know he will put up his best game ever straight to being named MVP Olsen has been vital to this Panther offense which seems to be unstoppable Recording back to back 1000 yard seasons Olsen is playing the best football of his career and is showing no signs of slowing down especially not Sunday Stay connected with The Jet PressFollow TheJetPressSuper Bowl MVPrsquos are known for making clutch plays and simply leading their team to victory While everyone is looking at either Peyton Manning or Cam Newton winning this prestigious award how about the guys they are throwing to How can you not give the player with multiple touchdown grabs and 200 yards receiving the MVP Olsenrsquos stats wont be that impressive come Sunday but expect this tight end to be the guy to come up big late in the game I expect Olsen to be Camrsquos favorite target on the biggest stage of their careers Newton knows his tight end will be his best bet to pass to when he needs to the most Sure he has Ted Ginn and company but when it comes down to crunch time Cam is going to look to pick on this Denver defense who isnrsquot the best when it comes to lining up against tight ends More from The Jet PressNY Jets Top 5

Spotlight Chris Ivory1d ago We saw late in the Patriots vs Broncos game where Rob Gronkowski started to take over and almost sent the Broncos packing in front of their home crowd Tom Brady connected with Gronkowski on a late 40 yard bomb on 4th down and then also again on the late touchdown on 4th down while in double coverage Irsquom not saying Olsen is anything like Gronk but if you let this quarterback and tight end duo have those kind of plays like the Patriots did it might send Manning straight into retirement with another Super Bowl loss The Broncos arenrsquot ready for what the Panthers have in store for them in Super Bowl 50 Whether itrsquos part of the game plan or not Olsen will have his fingerprints all over this Panthersrsquo offense and with some help from Cam he will be Super Bowl 50 MVP recording 9 receptions for 113 yards and two touchdowns both coming in the second half of the game More Jets ESPN experts way off before season on Super Bowl 50 picks Now I know what yoursquore thinking isnrsquot Newton gonna win the Super Bowl MVP award I mean he already has the regular season MVP locked up so why not both Newton will not win because Olsen will more than likely make a playmultiple plays that will leave us breathless Plays where Cam throws a bad ball and he still hauls in the catch whether hersquos holding the ball onto his head or itrsquos a corner of the endzone toe drag Olsen will be the reason the Panthers ultimately win Super Bowl 50          Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus             Tickets Powered by Scorebig
