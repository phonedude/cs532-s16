Turkey Chili
I cant remember ever enjoying a turkey burgertheyre so not memorable The lack of fat leaves them dry and unappetizing Ground turkey is perfect in chili though because the spices and simmering braise infuse the turkey with flavor over time and make up for the lack of fat Youll never miss it

1 tablespoon canola oil
1 yellow onion diced
Kosher salt
4 garlic cloves thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper diced
 cup chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 pound ground turkey
1 28ounce can plum tomatoes
3 cups Chicken Stock page 27 or lowsodium storebought chicken stock plus more as needed
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cups cooked white beans or 1 12ounce can drained and rinsed
1 cups cooked kidney beans or 1 12ounce can drained and rinsed
Optional garnishes sour cream or plain Greek yogurt sliced scallions and grated Cheddar cheese

Prep peel and dice the onion  peel and slice the garlic  seed and dice the bell pepper  drain and rinse the canned beans

Heat the canola oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat Add the onion and a pinch of kosher salt and saut stirring with a wooden spoon for about 2 minutes or until translucent Add the garlic and bell pepper and saut for 1 minute Add the chili powder cumin and cayenne and cook for at least 1 minute so that they bloom
Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 or 2 minutes to deepen its flavor
