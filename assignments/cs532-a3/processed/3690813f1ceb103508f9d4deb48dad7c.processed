31 2013 Remarks on American Leadership at the Council on Foreign RelationsFirst and foremost this socalled pivot has been about creative diplomacyLike signing a littlenoted treaty of amity and cooperation with ASEAN that opened the door to permanent representation and ultimately elevated a forum for engaging on highstakes issues like the South China Sea Weve encouraged Indias Look East

me offer five bigticket agenda items that we absolutely have to get right as well This starts with following through on what is often called our pivot to the Asia Pacific the most dynamic region in our rapidly changing world Much of the attention so far has been on Americas increasing military engagement But its important that we also emphasize the other elements of our strategy In a speech in Singapore last week I laid out Americas expanding economic leadership in the region from new trade agreements like the TransPacific Partnership to steppedup efforts on behalf of American businessesWe are welcoming more of our neighbors including Canada and Mexico into the TransPacific Partnership process And we think its imperative that we continue to build an economic relationship that covers the entire hemisphere for the future 4 November 17 2012 Delivering on the Promise of Economic Statecraft And with Singapore and a growing list of other countries on both sides of the Pacific we are making progress toward finalizing a farreaching new trade agreement called the TransPacific Partnership The socalled TPP will lower barriers raise standards and drive longterm growth across the region It will cover 40 percent of the worlds total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions including for women migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asias middle class and rebalance the global economy Canada and Mexico have already joined the original TPP partners We continue to consult with Japan And we are offering to assist with capacity building so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join We welcome the interest of any nation willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP including China5 November 15 2012 Remarks at Techport Australia we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the TransPacific Partnership or TPP Australia is a critical partner This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field And when negotiated this agreement will cover 40 percent of the worlds total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment6 November 14 2012 Remarks With Australian Foreign Minister Robert Carr Australian Defense Minister Stephen Smith and Secretary of Defense Leon PanettaOur diplomats work side by side at

Remarks With Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh After Their Meeting So were working on expanding it through a farreaching new regional trade agreement called the TransPacific Partnership which would lower trade barriers while raising standards on everything from labor conditions to environmental protection to intellectual property Both of our countries will benefit And in fact economists expect

Chamber of Commerce Reception and Commercial Signings Domestic and international businesses alike continue to face rules that restrict their activities and that in turn deters investment and slows growth So we are encouraging the Government of Vietnam to keep on the path of economic and administrative reform to open its markets to greater private investment And through the TransPacific Partnership were working with Vietnam and seven other nations to lower trade barriers throughout the region as we ensure the highest standards for labor environmental and intellectual property protections Vietnam was an early entrant to the TPP and were hoping we can finalize the agreement this year And the economic analysis is that of all the countries that will be participating  Australia
