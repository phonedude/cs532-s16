1 Week Ago


Defense leads Broncos over Panthers in Super Bowl

5 Days Ago








QB Cam Newton left accounted for 50 total touchdowns but Carolinas strength is the NFLs No 2 run game averaging 142 yards a game Newton is at his best in the red zone where the Panthers scored touchdowns a leaguebest 70 percent of their trips inside the opposing 20
That lines up with Denvers strength  the NFLs No 1 total defense No 1 pass defense No 1 in sacks No 3 run defense The Broncos had a leaguebest 52 sacks so for Newton to play well tackles Michael Oher and Mike Remmers must keep Pro Bowl outside LBs Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware from getting to Newton with any consistency
Carolinas offense has good depth  nine players scored two or more touchdowns this season with WR Ted Ginn 10 TDs and TE Greg Olsen seven leading the way RB Jonathan Stewart has a career average of better than 5 yards a carry in the postseason with three touchdowns in his past four games No team in the NFL ran the ball more than Carolina so Denver has to stop the Panthers run game and turn Newton into a more predictable dropback passer
When Denver has the ball
Which Peyton Manning shows up against Carolina He threw for only nine touchdown passes against 17 interceptions in 331 pass attempts leaning heavily on the Broncos defense Those interceptions are something to watch  Carolinas defense led the NFL with 24 interceptions and 38 total takeaways in the regular season
Denver has two solid backs in Ronnie Hillman 863 yards and CJ Anderson 720 yards but Anderson right is probably the more dangerous postseason threat  Hillman has a career average of 28 yards per carry in the playoffs while Anderson is at 46 Denver has the NFLs 27thbest red zone offense one of the most glaring differences from Carolina so theyll need to convert those opportunities  the Panthers are only 11th in redzone defense a relative weakness for that unit
The Broncos have two prolific receivers in Demaryius Thomas 1304 yards and Emmanuel Sanders 1135 but they need touchdowns to match their yards Manning hasnt thrown an interception in two playoff games  Super Bowl teams are 182 all time when they dont commit a turnover
Special teams matchup
Want a vulnerability for Carolina How about blocked kicks Graham Gano a former FSU standout had four field goals blocked as well as an extra point for an NFLhigh five blocked kicks And Denver nearly returned a blocked extra point for a touchdown against Detroit this season
Carolina ranked last in the NFL in kickoff return average but it has a proven threat on punt returns in Ted Ginn who has seven career touchdowns on returns including four on punts Denver had a return TD this season but lost returner Omar Bolden to a knee injury in the playoffs so it is less of a danger as a result
Denver reached this game with the help of a missed extra point so its worth noting that Gano has missed three of them this season He and Denvers Brandon McManus have the leg to hit a field goal from 55plus yards but the accuracy on the shorter kicks could be just as important
Coaching matchup
Both head coaches have plenty of Super Bowl experience as players and as coaches Carolinas Ron Rivera and Denvers Gary Kubiak are in their first Super Bowls as head coaches but theyve been here before
Kubiak has been in six Super Bowls losing three as Denvers backup quarterback then winning three in five years as an assistant with the 1994 49ers and the 97 and 98 Broncos Rivera won a Super Bowl as a Bears player in the 1985 season and was Lovie Smiths defensive coordinator when Chicago lost in 2006
Rivera has a chance to be just the fourth person to win a Super Bowl as a player and head coach joining his old coach Mike Ditka as well as Tom Flores and Tony Dungy
