        Today is treated as a national holiday in the United Statesnbsp Everywhere people will gather with family and friends to chow down on wings laugh at commercials and watch the Super Bowlnbsp Super Bowl Sunday is also one of the most active gambling days of the yearnbsp This year it is estimated that over 4 billion dollars in bets will be made about the big gamenbsp People can bet on anything from who will be the MVP of the game to whether Peyton Manning the Sheriff will retire immediately following the gamenbspThe question becomes is gambling on the game legalnbsp The answer to that question is much more difficult than one may thinknbsp Throughout the majority of the US gambling is outlawed including in Illinois and Missouri other than a few exceptions such as casinos the lottery and certain gaming machinesnbsp In fact gambling is outlawed in nearly every state and frowned upon by various federal laws and regulationsnbsp However the online nature of betting and gambling muddies the waters as the internet is nonphysical and thus the sports betting websites can be technically located or headquartered outside of the United Statesnbsp This creates massive problems for enforcement of the antigambling laws as most of them are aimed at the institutions not the individualsnbsp Therefore if the gambling websites are located outside of the United States they can avoid the purview of these laws and their enforcement nbspThis means that although the betting or gambling being done may still be illegal or at least frowned upon that the enforcement of these laws and regulations is difficult if not impossiblenbsp Thus anyone interested in betting online should be aware that these laws exist and despite the lack of enforcement of these laws to date that does not mean that the actual betting is legalnbsp This is even true of many NCAA office pools and other acts the majority of Americans consider common placenbspRegardless everyone at Hipskind amp McAninch LLC hopes that you enjoy this unofficial holiday with your family and friendsnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp
