      ESPN contributor Kevin Blackistone Bloomberg Views Kavitha Davidson and The Washington Posts Wesley Lowery talk about the UofL basketball team public opinion of the NFL and women in sports


    
        
    
    MICHEL MARTIN HOST 
    Now its time for the Barbershop Thats where we gather a bunch of interesting folks to talk about whats in the news and whats on their minds Sitting in the chairs for a shapeup this weekend are Kevin Blackstone sports columnist and contributor to ESPNs Around The Horn Kevin welcome back
    KEVIN BLACKISTONE Thank you very much
    MARTIN Out in San Francisco waiting for the start of Super Bowl 50 Kavitha Davidson is sports writer for Bloomberg View Hi Kavitha
    KAVITHA DAVIDSON Hi
    MARTIN And also welcome back to the Wesley Lowery reporter for The Washington Post Good to see you too
    WESLEY LOWERY Thanks for having me
    MARTIN So is everybody looking forward to Super Bowl Sunday
    BLACKISTONE Of course
    LOWERY Every time always
    DAVIDSON Very much so
    BLACKISTONE And getting it over with
    MARTIN And getting it over with I can imagine for those of you who are not civilians right The rest of us its fun but for you all its work But before we start on football I have to ask you about some news from the world of college basketball Ill start with you on this Kevin On Friday the University of Louisville announced a selfimposed ban on postseason play for their mens basketball program The  of course the team would have been a lock for the ACC and for the NCAA tournaments And I think weve talked about this before that the program has been under investigation after allegations that the team or somebody connected to the team hired exotic dancers
    BLACKISTONE Right
    MARTIN And escorts to entice recruits So Kevin how big of a deal is this
    BLACKISTONE Well its a huge deal This another embarrassment personally for Rick Pitino whos the coach under whose watch this apparently happened although he says he has no knowledge of it The NCAA calls that lack of institutional control And I think given the lured nature of these charges  Ive said it before Ive written before Rick Pitino should step aside
    MARTIN I dont get the selfimposed ban piece I dont
    BLACKISTONE Well theyre trying to get ahead of the NCAA Theyre trying to say look we are acknowledging we have some problems here Were going to penalize ourselves first so hopefully if you decide to penalize us you will be a little bit more lenient for us
    MARTIN Has that ever happened
    BLACKISTONE Yeah it happens all the time Its a
    MARTIN Does it work I mean do people
    BLACKISTONE It does work Its a card that people play all the time
    MARTIN Kavitha what are your thoughts about this Go ahead Kavitha
    DAVIDSON Well you know I think you always have to look up at what the school gets out of it And you know this isnt some magnanimous oh you know were mea culpa were admitting that we did something horrible and you know we deserve to be punished so were just going to do that to ourselves Theyre trying to evade a similar decision by the NCAA which likely would have come after this season and would have affected their future recruiting
    MARTIN OK well a lot to think about there Thatll be interesting to watch particularly as March is soon upon us And it will be really interesting to see what happens as the  you know March without the University of Louisville will be kind of interesting So all right on to the Super Bowl  if you are breathing in the United States laughter then you are aware  whether you care or not  the Carolina Panthers the Denver Broncos theyre going headtohead in Super Bowl 50 It will be held in San Francisco on Sunday But Wesley Im going to go to you on this because youre our kind of civilian right
    LOWERY Exactly right Im sitting here taking this in Im
    MARTIN Taking this all in right You know this is a year  Im going to go to our sports professionals in a minute  but this is a year in which theres been so much around the sport  you know domestic violence theres the cheating scandal theres publicity everywhere around the health effects of the sport Is any of that swirling in your mind as you watch this event
    LOWERY Of course I mean Ive actually seen in the last few years  you know and I used to be a very adamant follower of the NFL Basketballs always been sport number one but football was a close second And as these types of stories have boiled up time and time again these questions  whether it be ethically whether it be cheating whether it be health wise  you know what does football mean and what does it me to us culturally but also what type of environment is it fostering Its made it hard to keep continuing to be as adamant and as diehard as a fan of the sport Im surprised very often when I go to talk to a buddy from high school or a buddy from college and Im just asking them  you know my buddies are all in Cleveland so you know how was the Browns game last weekend X Y Z And so often theyre also talking about  yeah but did you see that movie about concussions or so on so forth Ive got friends now who are getting married and having children And so were having these conversations about oh you remember back when you were the wide receiver and I was the running back and would we let our sons do that type of thing now right And so I do think that in the national consciousness theres starting to be more of a conversation about again the role of professional football and football by and large and what that means for us as Americans and maybe whats fostered in kind of the culture of football more broadly
    MARTIN Hey Kavitha you know youre in San Francisco I hear that you attended the NFL Womens Summit which was held on Thursday and Friday Is this the first time the NFL has held a Womens Summit What was that all about
    DAVIDSON This is and it was actually  it was very encouraging You know Roger Goodell came and he spoke for about 15 minutes And he announced the implementation of basically the Rooney rule which is a rule that currently exists in the league that requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching positions And he announced a version of that for women in executive roles which is an interesting idea Were kind of short on details right now And the Rooney rule itself has been criticized because it hasnt actually been particularly effective You know you can interview as many minority candidates as possible but that doesnt necessarily translate into hiring It will be interesting to see if that actually does translate into better investigating of players better player discipline better programs to prevent in the first place domestic violence from happening And then also just you know other less nefarious things  whether we can engage female fans better So hopefully it will lead to a more inclusive environment
    MARTIN Well what  can I ask you this  and its a little bit of an icky question but Ill ask you Kevin this whole question of OK now the leagues going to reach out to women How does that sit with you as an AfricanAmerican man when you feel like the sport is 75 percent AfricanAmerican
    BLACKISTONE Right
    MARTIN And the players are 75 percent AfricanAmerican men And Im not trying to set up a
    BLACKISTONE Sure no but
    MARTIN Girls versus the boys kind of  but
    BLACKISTONE No its
    MARTIN Does that
    BLACKISTONE Its a very fair question because one of the little secrets about Title IX which has been around since  what  1972 is that it has had a greater positive impact for white women than for women of color many of whom we see playing in D1 revenuegenerating sport on the womens side in college and thats basketball
    MARTIN And why is that
    BLACKISTONE You know I think because people still need to be broken out of their old ideas about who can serve in a leadership position
    MARTIN What do you mean by its had a greater affect for white women than for AfricanAmerican women
    BLACKISTONE Well there have been more
    MARTIN Are you saying
    BLACKISTONE I think more  its been reported quantitatively that more white women have benefited from Title IX in terms of participation rates and in terms of employment rates in college athletics than women of color And  but women of color have a greater face when it comes to being the face of college athletics particularly in basketball than a lot of other people So they dont feel as if they get as fair of a shake in college athletics as some others
    MARTIN Kavitha you have thoughts on that
    DAVIDSON I think Kevins absolutely right especially if you look at headcoaching positions and you know athletic director assistant athletic director positions White women have benefited from Title IX in that respect much more than women of color have despite the fact that theyre coaching teams that mostly do  are comprised of women of color You know the other side of that of course is you know not to get into whos the more oppressed minority kind of thing If you look at salaries compared to what their male counterparts are making you know everybody still has ground to make up when it comes to catching up to the white men in these fields
    MARTIN Wesley before we let you I have to ask you about this And you know a lot of people are watching Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis who has a broken arm who had surgery on it But he says hes ready to play doesnt want to miss the Super Bowl I just have to ask you you know as a fan I dont know how to think about this I mean on the one hand hes a grown man But
    LOWERY Its tough
    MARTIN What is up with that
    LOWERY And thats why its hard in some ways to judge it one way or the other because you know here you have someone who has spent their entire adult life working towards a singular goal You know this is the type of thing that you very well may only get one opportunity to do And I know  I mean Ive got brothers both of whom are still college athletes right now both of whom have gotten injured before And were saying all right yeah you cant  one brother no you cant wrestle because this is hurt and the other brother no you cant do the longjump today because you got hurt No no no no no  if I dont do this then I cant go to the postseason and I cant  you know athletes are so singularly focused very often and theyre driven that way Look to tell the guy whos a professional football player your teams in the Super Bowl but you cant suit up I can understand why he wants to go out there That said Im going to watch the game and be worried the whole time that hes going to end up sprawled out on the ground And thats concerning a little bit
    MARTIN Wesley can you envision a time when you would just say to yourself no I cant  Im not going to watch this
    LOWERY I mean I dont know about all that right I mean
    LAUGHTER
    DAVIDSON Busted
    LOWERY I mean part of me would like to say yes But at the end of the day you know Im not going to not watch the Super Bowl because an athletes out there wanting to be an athlete You know if he gets hurt he gets hurt Weve seen bad injuries  we can see a bad injury Any other player on that field can get hurt pretty bad
    MARTIN Thats true Kevin
    BLACKISTONE We valorize playing through injury in sports I mean growing up I remember Jack Youngblood for the Rams playing with a broken leg I remember Ronnie Lott with the 49ers amputating a part of his finger so that he could continue to play I mean this is part of the lore of sports as crazy as it seems to the rest of us If I break my arm Im not working for like a week And all I do is write
    LAUGHTER
    MARTIN A very valid point All right before we let you go Im sorry I have to ask each of this really important question and I hope you dont mind But Kavitha Im going to go to you first  wings or pizza
    DAVIDSON New Yorker Im going to say pizza
    MARTIN Oh OK OK Kevin
    BLACKISTONE Wings so Ill pass on the gluten
    MARTIN Oh oh OK just be like that with celery no doubt
    BLACKISTONE Of course
    MARTIN No doubt
    LOWERY So Im still on the youngperson diet so I eat a lot of pizza normally And so Super Bowl day its wings
    MARTIN Well Buffalo or barbecue
    LOWERY A little honey chipotle keep it fancy
    BLACKISTONE Whoa
    LAUGHTER
    MARTIN Thanks to Kavitha Davidson Kevin Blackistone and Wesley Lowery Happy game day thank you
    LOWERY Thanks for having us
    BLACKISTONE Thank you
    DAVIDSON Thank you very much
