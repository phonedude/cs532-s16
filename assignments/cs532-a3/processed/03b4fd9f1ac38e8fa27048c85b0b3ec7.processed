    Coldplay It sure is a band
You might be extremely familiar with Coldplays hits or you might just think the band sucks and openly wonder how youre going to endure watching a 10plusminute medley of some of its more popular tunes during Super Bowl 50s halftime show
Regardless the odds are youre going to a Super Bowl party Even if you dont particularly care for football or the NFL the event is essentially unrivaled in terms of gettogethers in the United States With hundreds of other nations even getting in on the act regularly now the festivities have become almost as much a part of Super Bowl Sunday as the game itself

  
  
    
  


As you prepare to take in the game what better way to celebrate your love or distaste for Coldplay than by alienating people who feel similarly and differently alike
Here are 50 just abysmal Coldplay references to make you the MVP of your Super Bowl 50 party
1  When theres a flag on the play tell everyone And it was all Yellow
2 If the training staff come out on the field to attend to an injured player belt out And Iiiiiiiiiiiiii will Fix You
3 After a lesserknown player makes a big play insist his nickname is The Scientist

  
  
    
  


4 If the team you bet on goes down especially big start throwing your own feces around the living roombar like youre one of the apes in thenbspAdventure of a Lifetime music video
5  When theres a delay of game annoyingly sing Closing walls and ticking Clocks
6  If someone asks how a player on either team made a seemingly impossible play confidently answer Magic
7 If a fan or player is shown crying proudly tell everyone Every Teardrop is a Waterfall
 8  If a player fumbles chime in with Looks like he electednbspto consciously uncouple  with the football
 9  If a player breaks away for a long gain or score warble offkey GO FLYING AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
 10 If theres a bad hold point out how much thats like Charlie Brown and the Coldplay song Charlie Brown
 11 During a review astutely let everyone know Guess theyre gonna  Talk About It
 12  Inappropriately bring up everyone at your partys mortality then close the conversation with I dont want to follow Death And All of His Friends
 13  After the winning team starts to celebrate Guess theyre going to ParparparParadise to celebrate huh Huh Huh
 14 When Riverboat Ron does something particularly gambley start amelodically singing I used to roll the diceFeel the fear in my enemys eyes
 15  If the Santa Clara sky at night is shown in the postgame inform everyone waiting for their Uber Wow Just like the Coldplay song A Sky Full of Stars
 16 When you get owned by all the people youve been alienating all night reply Whoa you really put me  In My Place
 17  If your hosts still havent taken down their Christmas tree tell them Might want to box up those Christmas Lights guys You know Like the Coldplay song Christmas Lights
 18  When a commercial for The Grammys on CBS is shown featuring Rihanna sing Rihannas entire part from Princess of China loudly and proudly
 19  If either team gets behind unexpectedly early Looks like theyre really in  Trouble
 20  Should the game run long pipe up with Is this thing gonna be over by Midnight or what folks
 21 During any pause in conversation or a commercial break go on a lengthy extended rant about how you finally found your True Love especially right in front of a traumatized significant other if you brought them Then explain you were only jokingciting the Coldplay song of the same name
 22 In the pregame warmups when they show either Peyton Manning or Cam Newton say Guess the BroncosPanthers will See You Soon
 23 Confusingly tell fellow partygoers a nonsequitur story involving a Strawberry Swing just so you can inform everyone after how much you like the guitar riff in that one
 24 Compliment a member of the opposite sexs Green Eyes particularly if they have any other color of eyes Also a good thing to do in front of a dismayed significant other
 25 During the climax of the halftime show complain loudly that the band never released a Life in Technicolor III to complete trilogy after releasing a part I and II
 26  If the camera pans to a fan who is visibly cold in Levis Stadium stands jump in with Talk about a Shiver
 27  When they show the famed Lombard Street adamantly insist its actually called Violet Hill
 28 After a particularly close catch is ruled incomplete explain Thats The Hardest Part
 29  Ask your friends which Coldplay song you havent referenced yet Then answer your own question Oh yeah Always in My Head is pretty good I guess
 30  If one team falls behind early reassure their fans by reminding them Dont Panic
 31  Interrupt a key moment of the game by asking if everyones seen the movie Unbroken and then ask if they know Coldplay wrote a song for the movie called Miracles Theyll love it
 32 When its clear which team will lose say Wow Their championship hopes just went  Up In Flames
 33 When the game clock reads 136 remind everyone that that was a Coldplay song
 34 When the ball is on the 42yard line remind everyone theres also a Coldplay song called 42
 35 If a partygoer incorrectly explains a call on the field let them now Thats some Twisted Logic youve got there
 36  When Mike Carey says something that couldnt be less right agree with him vehemently and when the call goes against what you advocated for say Well I guess you can file that under Things I Dont Understand
 37 As the confetti rains down on the winning team let everyone now I guess theyll be sending Postcards from Far Away You know as they celebrate their championship
 38  If a team plays better after one of its starters is sidelined with injury inform everyone that it was a real Major Minus
 39  Following a particularly painful hit blow your friends minds by letting them know That hit really looks like it Hurts like Heaven am I right
 40  Continually request a Glass of Water and when youre brought water explain you meant instead you wanted the party to play the Coldplay song of the same name
 41 If a quarterback throws a picksix proclaim Everythings Not Lost especially if everything is lost
 42 Talk about that time Coldplay had a song on the soundtrack for one of the Hunger Games films and then strongly advocate for a reallife hunger games
 43  Should Denver win opine I wonder if theyll go to celebrate in  Amsterdam Heh just kidding Denver basically is Amsterdam You know Because of weed
 44  If the game proves particularly unwatchable keep repeatedly letting everyone know what an Amazing Day it was anyway
 45 If Cam Newton is on the precipice of winning the MVP cleverly point out Talk about an Army of One
 46 Even though you already referenced it at least once when the game reaches the final twominute warning let everyone know Clocks I mean really
 47 When Cam or Peyton smiles as his team celebrates tell the television God Put A Smile Upon Your Face
 48  When a ball falls incomplete explain to everyone just like a scientist that that was the result of Gravity
 49  After the result is final I guess the losing team really  Lost as the entire party groans
 50 Blame your grating absolutely garbage Coldplay puns on a visit to the Poppyfields pregame and then fist pump and explain that was your 50th reference for Super Bowl 50
  
If you made it this far and you have any friends left at all you did it You really did it And even though youve alienated all your peers coworkers and loved ones at least you still have Chris Martin and Cos seven albums to keep near and dear to your heart
