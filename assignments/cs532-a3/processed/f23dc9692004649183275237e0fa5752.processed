		Peyton Manning Won8217t Say If This Game Was His Last		
			PhotoDenver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning celebrates with the Vince Lombardi trophyCredit Doug MillsThe New York Times
Interviewed on the field after the game Peyton Manning was asked if he was intending to retire  The 39year old quarterback cited some advice he got from his old coach Tony Dungy who told him not to make a big decision while he8217s overly emotional So the retirement announcement that so many people expected did not happen and the world will have to wait to see if No 18 wants to suit up for another season
You know Ill take some time to reflect I have a couple of priorities first8221 said Manning when asked if he8217s played his last game 8220I want to go kiss my wife and my kids I want to go hug my family Im going to drink a lot of Budweiser tonight I promise you that

		Von Miller Named Super Bowl MVP

As expected Von Miller was named MVP of Super Bowl 50 The storyline all week was the potential for this to be Peyton Manning8217s last game but Miller a standout linebacker dominated the game from start to finish His two forced fumbles led to both of Denver8217s touchdowns and he had Cam Newton off of his game all night

		Denver Broncos Win Super Bowl 2410		
			PhotoDenver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning celebrated his second Super Bowl victoryCredit Doug MillsThe New York Times
The Carolina Panthers may have had a more wellrounded team than the Denver Broncos but in the end the superiority of the Broncos8217 defense was all that mattered and the Broncos won Super Bowl 50 by a score of 2410 
A unit that is destined to be remembered alongside the 1985 Chicago Bears 2000 Baltimore Ravens and 1976 Pittsburgh Steelers the Wade Phillipsled defensive unit was far too much for the Carolina offense to handle On nearly every play Von Miller and the team8217s passrush was in the Carolina backfield while Chris Harris Jr and the team8217s secondary shut down any attempts at throwing the ball down the field
In perhaps the biggest show of force by the Denver defense they essentially removed Cam Newton8217s safety valve by taking Greg Olsen out of the game for the most part The big tight end is Newton8217s goto receiver in nearly every situation but he was held to 4 receptions for 41 yards as the team mixed up the coverage against him and Newton failed to find any openings 
The Panthers have a bright future with a highquality defense and a quarterback who could be truly special if he had a few more solid receiving options but Phillips had a plan on how he could beat them and his players executed it perfectly
Peyton Manning will likely retire having won two Super Bowls but this game will be remembered far more for Miller8217s dominance than it will for having been Manning8217s final game

		Von Miller Should be MVP		
			Unless Cam Newton pulls off an absolutely incredible comeback the MVP of this game has to be Von Miller The standout linebacker has 6 tackles 25 sacks and 2 forced fumbles one of which led to a defensive touchdown and the other which led to Denver8217s only offensive touchdown He had plenty of help from the other stars on the Broncos defense but it was Miller who shined the brightest with the game on the line

		Carolina Needs to Score Fast		
			After Denver converted a twopoint conversion the Panthers will get the ball back down 2410 with a little more than three minutes to play The path to victory for Carolina seems incredibly steep currently They have had an incredible season but Von Miller and the Denver defense have been just too much for them

		Broncos Finally Score		
			Peyton Manning made possibly his worst pass of the game in terms of accuracy launching a ball well out of the reach of Demaryius Thomas in the end zone but on the play Josh Norman was called for holding which gave Denver a fresh set of downs 
On the next play after the incompletion CJ Anderson punched the ball in for a touchdown pushing Denver8217s lead to 2210 prior to the team8217s attempt at a twopoint conversion
The touchdown will make it nearly impossible for Carolina to come back and it allows the Broncos to avoid the ignominy of being the first Super Bowl winner to not have an offensive touchdown

		Von Miller Is Denver8217s Offense		
			Von Miller likely just sealed the game for Denver and made sure no one can deny he was the game8217s MVP The superstar linebacker pulled the ball out of Cam Newton8217s hands and Denver recovered the ball giving the Broncos such a short field that even their offense should be able to score
I repeat8230 Von Miller MVP

		Is Marshawn Lynch Done Cryptic Tweet Leaves Us Wondering		
			httpstwittercomMoneyLynchstatus696525541826924546
Marshawn Lynch the hardcharging running back of the Seattle Seahawks tweeted out a somewhat ambiguous message during the game possibly indicating that he has decided to retire After being the talk of last year8217s Super Bowl for not getting the ball with the game on the line Lynch apparently decided people should talk about him during this game as well
Twitter as usual reacted to the news with humor
I will always remember this game as the one that convinced Marshawn Lynch to retire

		Sylvester Williams Doesn8217t Need Credit		
			Sylvester Williams is a classic nostats nose tackle If he does his job he comes away form the game with maybe one or two tackles and not much else but his ability to take on multiple offensive linemen lets the team8217s other defenders find openings to get to the cornerback
With his team trying to stave off a Panthers comeback Williams reached up on second down and tipped a Cam Newton pass taking away the momentum on the drive for Carolina
In what likely felt awfully familiar for Williams his clutch play ended with his teammates congratulating Malik Jackson who was near the ball when Williams tipped it

See if you can spot the quick appearance of a 1980s star in the ad from Avocados From Mexico

		Peyton Manning Narrowly Avoids Interception		
			Peyton Manning was lucky to have a threeandout because on third down he tried to test Josh Norman and the shutdown cornerback very nearly intercepted the pass
The Panthers now have the ball and are down by just six points With nine minutes left to play they will want to score but they won8217t want to score all that quickly

		Panthers Back Within One Score		
			Ted Ginn Jr couldn8217t hold on to a ball that hit him in the hands the Denver defender on his back didn8217t help and the Panthers had to settle for a 39yard field goal by Graham Gano that brought them back within one score of a win
Considering how bad Denver8217s offense has looked giving them back the ball isn8217t that much of a problem But if Peyton Manning were looking to have this game be a good memory rather than the time he won a Super Bowl without having contributed much it would be a good time to remember how to score

		Two Fumbles on One Drive Are One Too Many		
			PhotoDenver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning 18 fumblesCredit Doug MillsThe New York Times
Peyton Manning fumbled twice on the drive and lost the second one when the Panthers dove on the ball to give their offense another chance to wake up
No team has ever won a Super Bowl without an offensive touchdown and right now it seems like Denver can8217t possibly score Their defense has been nothing short of incredible but the door is still wide open for Carolina to come back and win

			There has been plenty of social media grumbling about this game with some experts already ranking it among the weaker recent Super Bowls 
This is like a TennesseeJacksonville game in week 3
mdash Richard M Nixon dick_nixon February 8 2016

mdash Andrew Das AndrewDasNYT February 8 2016
So far the Super Bowl is very boring 8211 not nearly as exciting as politics 8211 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
mdash Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump February 8 2016
There are lots of reasons Lack of offense is never a crowd pleaser and Denver is bidding to win the game with just one touchdown on a fumble recovery
There have also been a slew of penalties 14 at last count No one goes to a big game hoping to see a lot of unsportsmanlike conduct
There is still almost a quarter to play A Carolina comeback or some throwback Manning magic may save the game yet

		The Fourth Quarter Begins		
			With the third quarter now completed the Broncos are clinging to a 167 lead despite having not managed to do much of anything on offense Denver has just 174 yards with only has seven first downs but if their defense can hold tight for 15 minutes more of game clock then they will walk away as Super Bowl winners
At this point Von Miller would have to be the favorite for MVP of the game even if sports writers known for being sentimental will badly want to give it to Manning

Another Panthers drive came up with nothing when Cam Newton8217s pass went through Ted Ginn Jr8217s hands and right into the waiting arms of TJ Ward Ward stumbled and then fumbled but Denver recovered the ball and will try to add on to their lead
And the Broncos now have all three turnovers that Wade Phillips asked for It would help Phillips8217 prediction come true if Denver can turn the interception into some points

		Philly Brown Helps Out His Quarterback		
			Cam Newton8217s long pass to Philly Brown was a bit underthrown but the undersized wide receiver turned around and jumped for it making a great 42yard catch For the most part Newton succeeds by throwing absolutely perfect passes to his underwhelming wide receivers but in that case he definitely got some help 
Newton was hit on the play and has been dropped far more than normal in the game It will be interesting to see how he handles the abuse as the game stretches into the fourth quarter

		Panthers Hold Broncos to Field Goal		
			Brandon McManus was forced to come out for a 30yard field goal because the Panthers secondary tightened up once the ball was in the red zone and Peyton Manning could find no room to work Manning is still trying to exploit Robert McClain and Cortland Finnegan but when the field gets short the defensive backs are handling their assignments well
Not scoring a touchdown on a drive in which Emmanuel Sanders had a pair of fantastic receptions was not ideal for Denver but pushing the lead to 9 points thus making Carolina need at least two scores to tie is a huge difference in a tightlycontested game

		Peyton Manning Connecting With Sanders		
			Peyton Manning is getting a bit more aggressive and it is paying dividends so far on the drive with two big receptions by Emmanuel Sanders Both passes could generously be described as having some 8220touch8221 on them but in truth they were awfully wobbly So Manning even when finding success seems to be playing with fire
