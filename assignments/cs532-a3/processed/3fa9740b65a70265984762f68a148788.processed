nations top diplomat under President Barack ObamaWashington CNNColin Powell and top staffers for Condoleezza Rice received classified information through personal email accounts according to a new report from State Department investigatorsHillary Clinton has received severe criticism  particularly from Republicans and computer security experts  for using her personal email account while serving as the nations top diplomat under President Barack Obama Thursdays revelation about the two secretaries of state under former President George W Bush gave her supporters an opportunity to claim the Democratic presidential candidate was being singled out over the practiceThe emails were discovered during a State Department review of the email practices of the past five secretaries of state It found that Powell received two emails that were classified and that the immediate staff working for Rice received 10 emails that were classifiedThe information was deemed either secret or confidential according to the reportBased on the departments responses and findings to date additional potential classified material andor highly sensitive information not intended for distribution may reside in the Departments unclassified paper and electronic archives associated with Secretaries Powell and Rice and their respective staff a memo about the report saidRead MoreIn all the cases however  as well as Clintons  the information was not marked classified at the time the emails were sent according to State Department investigatorsPowell noted that point in a statement on ThursdayThe State Department cannot now say they were classified then because they werent Powell said If the Department wishes to say a dozen years later they should have been classified that is an opinion of the Department that I do not shareI have reviewed the messages and I do not see what makes them classified Powell saidClinton has argued that the messages from her email have since been deemed classified by the intelligence community as part of an interagency dispute between the intelligence community and the State Department over whether the information should have been classifiedAdditionally Powell said he never kept the emails in his possession when he left the State Department Unlike Clinton Powells emails remained in government computer serversAn aide to Rice who now teaches at Stanford University said that Rice herself never used email  not even a personal email account  during her tenureClinton who is now running for president has weathered a year of political fire for setting up a personal email server at her home in Chappaqua New York to conduct business as secretary of state That allowed her to place her official state communication outside government purview and under her complete control Critics claim this put national secrets at riskJohn Podesta Clintons presidential campaign chairman said these issues are overblown All of these instances are examples of how government bureaucrats keep too many things secret he saidClinton agrees with her predecessor that his emails like hers are being inappropriately subjected to overclassification he said in a statementDemocrats blast probeThe inspector generals report was addressed to Patrick Kennedy the under secretary of state for management Kennedy was interviewed by the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Wednesday and this report was also shared members of the governments intelligence communityRep Elijah E Cummings DMaryland was the first to make these findings public On Wednesday he issued a statement blasting Republicans for singling out Clinton over the issueBased on this new revelation it is clear that the Republican investigations are nothing more than a transparent political attempt to use taxpayer funds to target the Democratic candidate for President Cummings saidTheres now an effort to relax the investigation House Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republican politicians are wary of multiple congressional probes into Clintons email appearing too political and have instructed House chairmen to stand down and let the FBI take the leadWe are going to respect the FBIs investigation Ryan told reporters on Thursday adding that FBI Director James Comey and his team have the tools they need to do itRyans remarks also came after House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz publicly touted his own review and suggested he had new information Chaffetzs panel had already sent a letter to the State Department last month asking Secretary John Kerry for information about the departments handling of requests made under the Freedom of Information ActChaffetzs efforts keep raising alarm bells inside Republican Party Speaking about Clinton he recently said Im not specifically trying to target the secretary but when she creates her own private email system shes ensnarled herselfMeanwhile Ryan and other members of his leadership team are telling Chaffetz to back off according to multiple House Republican sources Theyre worried that Chaffetz a Republican from Utah will damage any credibility of an congressional inquiry by appearing overly partisan Chaffetz has endorsed Florida GOP Sen Marco Rubio for president and has gone on the campaign trail to boost his candidacySimilarly the House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith has expressed interest in examining Clintons use of a private server But an aide to the House Science Committee now tells CNN they would defer to the FBIs expanding investigationWe expect the FBI to do its job and fully investigate cybervulnerabilities that may have resulted from former Secretary Clintons decision to deviate from established cybersecurity standards and requirements the aide saidCorrection The headline of this post has been updated to reflect that Rices staffers received the emails that are now considered classifiedLendingTreeRates hit 302 APR 15 yr See if youre eligible Cut credit card
