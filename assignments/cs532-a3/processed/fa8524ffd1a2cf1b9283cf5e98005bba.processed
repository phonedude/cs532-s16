					The Clinton System

					Daniel BerehulakGetty ImagesHillary Rodham Clinton and Bill Clinton during the seventh annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative CGI New York City September 22 2011
On January 17 in the final Democratic debate before the primary season begins Bernie Sanders attacked Hillary Clinton for her close financial ties to Wall Street something he had avoided in his campaigning up to that moment I dont take money from big banksYouve received over 600000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year he said Sanderss criticisms coincided with recent reports that the FBI might be expanding its inquiry into Hillary Clintons emails to include her ties to big donors while serving as secretary of state But a larger question concerns how Hillary and Bill Clinton have built their powerful donor machine and what its existence might mean for Hillary Clintons future conduct as American president The following investigation drawing on many different sources is intended to give a full sense of the facts about Clinton and not to endorse a particular candidate in the coming election
Its an axiom of Washington politics in the age of Citizens United and Super PACs that corporations and the very rich can channel almost unlimited amounts of money to candidates for high office to pave the way for later favors According to the public service website Open Secrets in the 2016 campaign as of October in addition to direct campaign contributions Jeb Bush had at his disposal 103 million in outside moneygroups such as PACs and Super PACs and so called dark money organizations that work on behalf of a particular candidate Ted Cruz had 38 million in such funds Marco Rubio 17 million and Chris Christie 14 million
Yet few have been as adept at exploiting this bigmoney politics as Bill and Hillary Clinton In the 2016 campaign as of October Hillary Clinton had raised 20 million in outside money on top of 77 million in direct campaign contributionsthe highest in direct contributions of any candidate at the time But she and her husband have other links to big donors and they go back much further than the current election cycle What stands out about what I will call the Clinton System is the scale and complexity of the connections involved the length of time they have been in operation the presence of former president Bill Clinton alongside Hillary as an equal partner in the enterprise and the sheer magnitude of the funds involved
Scale and complexity arise from the multiple channels that link Clinton donors to the Clintons there is the stream of sixfigure lecture fees paid to Bill and Hillary Clinton mostly from large corporations and banks which have earned them more than 125 million in the fifteen years since Bill Clinton left office in 2001 There are the direct payments to Hillary Clintons political campaigns including for the Senate in 2000 and for the presidency in 2008 and now in 2016 which had reached a total of 7124 million as of September 30 2015 the most recent figures compiled by Open Secrets Four of the top five sources of these funds are major banks Citigroup Inc Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase amp Co and Morgan Stanley The Clinton campaign meanwhile has set a goal of raising 1 billion for her Super PAC for the 2016 election
Finally there is the nearly 2 billion that donors have contributed to the Clinton Foundation and its satellite organizations since Bill Clinton left office It may seem odd to include donations to the foundation among the chief ways that corporations and the superrich can gain access to the Clintons earn their goodwill and hope for future favors in return The foundations funds are mostly spent on unequivocally good causeseverything from promoting forestation in Africa and helping small farmers in the Caribbean to working with local governments and businesses in the US to promote wellness and physical fitness
Moreover not all donors to the Clinton Foundation and its affiliated institutions are corporate The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for example ranks among the largest contributors to the Clinton Foundation having made grants totaling more than 25 million since its inception and with a special focus to quote a 2014 Clinton Foundation press release on a partnership to gather and analyze data about the status of women and girls participation around the world
But among the largest contributors to the foundation are many of the same donors that have supported Hillary Clintons political campaigns and that have paid the Clintons sixfigure lecture fees For these mainly corporate donors access to the Clintons may be as important as the purposes for which their donations are used According to a February 2015 analysis of Clinton Foundation funding by The Washington Post the financial services industry has accounted for the largest single share of the foundations corporate donors Other major donors to the foundation have included US defense and energy corporations and their overseas government clients
Former US presidents have long used charitable foundations as a way to perpetuate their influence and to attract speaking fees as a lucrative source of income But the Clintons are unique in being able to rely on the worldwide drawing power of former president Bill Clinton to help finance the political career of Hillary Clintonwith the expectation among donors that as a senator secretary of state and possible future president Hillary Clinton might be well placed to return their favors The annual meetings of the Clinton Global Initiative have provided a prime setting for transactions between the Clintons and their benefactors Among the corporate sponsors of the 2014 and 2015 CGI conferences in New York City for example were HSBC Coca Cola Monsanto Proctor and Gamble Cisco PricewaterhouseCoopers the Blackstone Group Goldman Sachs Exxon Mobile Microsoft and Hewlett Packard For sponsorship of 250000 or more corporate executives attending the CGI meetings can enjoy special privileges up to and including direct access to the Clintons
Shannon StapletonReutersCorbisFrank Giustra speaks as former President Bill Clinton looks on during a press conference announcing the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative New York June 21 2007
In a 2013 investigative article for The New Republic Alec MacGillis described the annual CGI meeting as a complicated give and take in which CEOs provide cash for CGI projects in exchange for access to Bill Clinton MacGillis focused on the activities of Douglas Band a former lowlevel aide in the Clinton White House who at the CGI meetings arranged favors for selected CEOs such as getting them on the stage with Clinton relaxing the background checks for credentials or providing slots in the photo line At the CGIs 2012 meeting it was Muhtar Kent then CEO of Coca Cola who The New York Times reported won a coveted spot on the dais with Mr Clinton
Along with the Clinton Foundation lecture fees have offered another way for interested parties such as Citicorp and Goldman Sachs to support the Clintons beyond direct campaign donations Data drawn from the Clintons annual financial statements the Clinton Foundation and the banks themselves show that between 2001 and 2014 Bill Clinton earned 152 million in fees from UBS 135 million from Goldman Sachs 900000 from the Bank of America 770000 from Deutsche Bank and 650000 from Barclays Capital Since she stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013 Hillary Clinton has been earning comparable fees from the same sources Of the nearly 10 million she earned in lecture fees in 2013 alone nearly 16 million from major Wall Street banks including 675000 from Goldman Sachs the payments referred to by Bernie Sanders in the January 17 2016 debate and 225000 each from UBS Bank of America Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank
Among the most striking and troubling aspects of the Clinton System are the large contributions corporations and foreign governments have made to the Clinton Foundation along with Bill Clintons readiness to accept sixfigure speaking fees from some of them at times when the donors themselves had a potential financial interest in decisions being made at Hillary Clintons State Department An investigation published in April 2015 by Andrew Perez David Sirota and Matthew CunninghamCook at International Business Times shows that during the threeyear period from October 2009 through December 2012 when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state there were at least thirteen occasionscollectively worth 25 millionwhen Bill Clinton received a sixfigure speaking fee from corporations or trade groups that according to Federal Government records were at the time engaged in lobbying at the State Department
These payments to Bill Clinton in 2010 included 175000 from VeriSign Corporation which was engaged in lobbying at the State Department on cybersecurity and Internet taxation 175000 from Microsoft which was lobbying the government on the issuance of immigrant work visas 200000 from SalesForce a firm that lobbied the government on digital security issues among other things In 2011 these payments included 200000 from Goldman Sachs which was lobbying on the Budget Control Act and 200000 from PhRMA the trade association representing drug companies which was seeking special trade protections for USinnovated drugs in the TransPacific Partnership then being negotiated
And in 2012 payments included 200000 from the National Retail Federation which was lobbying at the State Department on legislation to fight Chinese currency manipulation 175000 from BHP Billiton which wanted the government to protect its mining interests in Gabon 200000 from Oracle which like Microsoft was seeking the government to issue work visas and measures dealing with cyberespionage and 300000 from Dell Corporation which was lobbying the State Department to protest tariffs imposed by European countries on its computers
During Hillary Clintons tenure as secretary of state US defense corporations and their overseas clients also contributed between 54 and 141 million to the Clinton Foundation Because the foundation discloses a range of values within which the contributions of particular donors might fall only minimum and maximum estimates can be given In the same period these US defense corporations and their overseas government clients also paid a total of 625000 to Bill Clinton in speaking fees
In March 2011 for example Bill Clinton was paid 175000 by the Kuwait America Foundation to be the guest of honor and keynote speaker at its annual Washington gala Among the sponsors were Boeing and the government of Kuwait through its Washington embassy Shortly before the State Department under Hillary Clinton had authorized a 693 million deal to provide Kuwait with Boeings Globemaster military transport aircraft As secretary of state Hillary Clinton had the statutory duty to rule on whether proposed arms deals with foreign governments were in the USs national interest
Further research done by Sirota and Perez of International Business Times and based on US government and Clinton Foundation data shows that during her term the State Department authorized 165 billion in commercial arms sales to twenty nations that had given money to the Clinton Foundation These include the governments of Saudi Arabia Oman Qatar Algeria Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates all of whose records on human rights had been criticized by the State Department itself During Hillary Clintons years as secretary of state arms sales to the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation ran at nearly double the value of sales to the same nations during George W Bushs second term There was also an additional 151 billion worth of armaments sold to sixteen nations that had donated funds to the Clinton Foundation these were deals organized by the Pentagon but which could only be completed with Hillary Clintons authorization as secretary of state They were worth nearly one and a half times the value of equivalent sales during Bushs second term
Among the most important and lucrative business friendships the Clintons have formed through the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiatives has been that with Canadian energy billionaire Frank Giustra A major donor to the foundation for many years Giustra became a member of its board and since 2007 has been cosponsor of the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative or CGGI In turn Bill Clintons political influence and personal contacts with foreign heads of state have been crucial to Giustras international business interests
In September 2005 Bill Clinton and Giustra travelled to Almaty in southeast Kazakhstan to meet with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev At their meeting Clinton told Nazarbayev that he would support Kazakhstans bid to become chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE The OSCE is a body with the responsibility for verifying among other things the fairness of elections among member states According to multiple sources including the BBC The Washington Post and The New York Times Nazarbayev coveted this position for Kazakhstan primarily as a mark of European diplomatic respectability for his country and himself
Clintons endorsement of the Kazakh bid was truly bizarre in view of Kazakhstans ranking by Transparency International as among the most corrupt countries in the world126th on a par with Pakistan Belarus and Honduras Freedom House in New York judges Kazakhstan to be not free with Nazarbayev clocking up Sovietera margins of victory of 90 percent or more in Kazakh presidential elections Yet in a December 2005 letter to Nazarbayev following one of his landslide victories Bill Clinton wrote Recognizing that your work has received an excellent grade is one of the most important rewards in life It is unclear what influence if any Bill Clintons support for Nazarbayev may have had in Kazakhstans efforts to lead the OSCE but in 2007 after the United States gave its backing to the bid Kazakhstan was chosen as the next chair of the OSCE a position it assumed in 2010
Possible reasons for Clintons support become clearer when we scrutinize the activities of Frank Giustra In a January 31 2008 article in The New York Times Jo Becker and Don Van Natta Jr provided detailed evidence that Nazarbayev brought his influence to bear to enable Giustra to beat out betterqualified competitors for a stake in Kazakhstans uranium mines worth 350 million In an interview with the Times Moukhtar Dzakishev then chair of the stateowned nuclear holding company Kazatomprom confirmed that Giustra had met with Nazarbayev in Almaty that Giustra had told the dictator he was trying to do business with Kazatomprom and that he was told in return Very good go to it
The deal was closed within fortyeight hours of Clintons departure from Almaty Following this successful visit to Central Asia Giustra donated 31 million to the Clinton Foundation He then made a further donation of 100 million to the foundation in June 2008
In an interview with David Remnick for a September 2006 New Yorker profile on Clintons postpresidency Giustra described how his ties to Clinton could work for him and his interests With Bill Clinton at that moment riding aboard his private executive jet for a journey across Africa complete with leather furniture and a stateroom according to The New Yorker Giustra told Remnick that all of my chips almost are on Bill Clinton Hes a brand a worldwide brand and he can do things and ask for things that no one else can
The ClintonGiustra connection became even more important in Colombia where from 2005 onward Bill Clinton arranged a series of meetings between Giustra and thenpresident lvaro Uribe during which Clinton was frequently present Giustra was already known in Colombia as the founder and backer of Pacific Rubiales a Colombian oil company formed in 2003 In 2007 according to The Wall Street Journal Bill Clinton had invited Uribe and Giustra to meet with him at the Clintons home in Chappaqua New York
The meetings provided a way for Giustra to lobby Uribe and his administration on behalf of Pacific Rubiales at a time when the Uribe administration was seeking to end the dominance of the national oil company Ecopetrol and open up the sector to foreign investors These contacts appear to have born fruit for Giustra In 2007 Pacific Rubiales signed a 300 million deal with Ecopetrol to build a 250 kilometer pipeline between Meta and Casanare provinces in Central Colombia In the same year Pacific Rubiales gained control of the Rubiales oilfield Colombias largest
Miguel SolanoAFPGetty ImagesBill Clinton and Colombian President lvaro Uribe in Bogota Colombia June 22 2005
Uribe was a singular interlocutor for Clinton and Giustra The Colombian leader had been viewed by the George W Bush administration as a crucial ally in the War on Drugs in which Colombia was often held up as a success story Yet Uribe and his political allies had longstanding connections to the Colombian drug cartels In a 1991 intelligence report from the US Defense Intelligence Agency DIA declassified in August 2004 described Uribe as a Colombian politician and senator dedicated to collaboration with the Medellin Cartel at high government levels Uribe was linked to a business involved in narcotics activities in the United States He has worked for the Medelln cartel and is a close personal friend of Pablo Escobar Gaviria the longtime drug kingpin
A 2011 report on events of 2010 by Human Rights Watch provides detailed evidence that Uribe was not free of this poisonous legacy when he was dealing with Clinton and Giustra The report described President Uribes administration as racked by scandals over extrajudicial killings by the army a highly questioned paramilitary demobilization process and abuses by the national intelligence service which participated in illegal surveillance of human rights defenders journalists opposition politicians and Supreme Court justices Hillary Clinton was warned about these human rights violations when as secretary of state she met with Bill Clinton Giustra and Uribe during a trip to Bogota the Colombian capital in June 2010 In an email message relayed to Secretary Clinton by the US Embassy in Bogota Rep Jim McGovern of Massachusetts warned that while in Colombia the most important thing the Secretary can do is to avoid effusive praise for President lvaro Uribe
Hillary Clinton chose to ignore the warning Addressing Uribe in the visits keynote speech Clinton described him as an essential partner to the United States whose commitment to building strong democratic institutions here in Colombia would leave a legacy of great progress that will be viewed in historic terms During her visit Clinton also affirmed her support for a USColumbia free trade agreement from which Giustra and other wealthy investors stood to benefit This reversed her previous opposition to the agreement during her campaign for president in 2008 on grounds of Colombias poor human rights record especially concerning the rights of labor unions
Since the Giustra deal there have also been complaints about the treatment of workers at Pacific Rubialess Colombian oil fields which has been the target of numerous strikes and lawsuits by prolabor groups In an August 2011 speech to the Colombian Senate Jorge Robledo leader of the Polo Democrtico Alternativo Social Democratic Party in the Colombian Senate described the living quarters for Pacific Rubiales employees as concentration camplike with work shifts that sometimes exceeded sixteen hours a day for weeks on end inadequate sanitary facilities and shared beds and with the company relying on thirdparty hiring halls to avoid unionization and the payment of pension and healthcare benefits In April 2015 Peter Volk general counsel for Pacific Rubiales denied these allegations saying that the corporation fully respects the rights of its workers and demands from companies that provide services to it to also do so
The record of the Clinton System raises deep questions about whether a Hillary Clinton presidency would take on the growing political influence of large corporate interests and Wall Street banks The next president will need to address critical economic and social issues including the stagnating incomes of the middle class the tax loopholes that allow hedgefunders and other members of the superrich to be taxed at lower rates than many average Americans and the runaway costs of higher education Above all is the question of further reform of Wall Street and the banking system to prevent a recurrence of the behavior that brought about the Great Recession of 20072008
So far Hillary Clinton has refused to commit herself to a reintroduction of the Depressionera GlassSteagall Act which Bill Clinton allowed to be repealed in 1999 on the advice of Democrats with close ties to Wall Street including Robert Rubin and Larry Summers The reintroduction of GlassSteagall favored by Bernie Sanders would prevent banks from speculating in financial derivatives a leading cause of the 20072008 crash With leading Wall Street banks so prominent in the Clintons fundraising streams can Hillary Clinton be relied upon to reform the banks beyond the modest achievements of the DoddFrank bill of 2010
