		James Taylor sang the words that everybody including the Denver Broncos will be singingmumbling come Sunday night  Aint it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind Yes Im going to Carolina in my mind
 The Panthers are taking all of us to Carolina  as they win Super Bowl 50
So its just a guess but  there are all kinds of reasons to pick the Panthers to win the biggest game of the year the most basic among them being that they are and have been the best team in the NFL the entire season and they remain the best now

		None of the sentimentality surrounding 39yearold Peyton Manning and his possible retirement changes that
Cam Newton is the best player too utilizing those previously raw talents now refined into a quarterback who can hurt a defense with acumen and athleticism both of which are required to beat that ohsoaggressive Broncos defense Hes much more of course than the dabbing celebrating showboating alienator on whom the haters love to hate
After studying what Denvers D did to Tom Brady and the Patriots Newton along with Carolina offensive coordinator Mike Shula will be prepared to attempt at least to take advantage of that aggression  namely the devastating pass rush of Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware  with zone reads with Newtons ability to run the ball between the tackles
His physicality will be required to make that work  and it will enough to create some vulnerability out of Denvers biggest strength stirring a few big plays enough to beat the Broncos Newton is bigger than many of the linebackers in the league and hes got that big arm which coupled with his speed will balance the attack and enable the Panthers to do what the Patriots couldnt
It is a bit of a warning that the last time Newton faced Manning back in 2012 Newton was sacked seven times by Denvers defense and the Panthers lost 3614
That was then this is now
Carolinas defense led by Luke Kuechly is difficult especially against the run For all the talk about Manning it is on the ground where the Broncos must have success in order to give themselves a chance of winning That could be problematic
Its easy to believe the Panthers defense will jam things up along the front and utilize press coverage to force Manning to try to beat them over the top something that may not work all that well for Denver The talk this week has been that the legendary quarterback possibly playing in his last game has looked sharp passing in practice has looked better than he has all season which plainly spoken hasnt been all that great Thats what hell have to be on Sunday great
Without enough run support Peytons rising is a tall order
While Josh Norman is a great cornerback great enough to have shut down his side of the field for much of the regular season and the playoffs the rest of the Carolina secondary is soso But it is notable that the back of that defense along with linebacker Kuechly has been one of only two defenses that gained more interceptions this season than passing touchdowns allowed Thats impressive
Yeah were all just guessing here But the versatility of Newton along with the limitations of the Broncos offense going up against these fine defenses is enough to tilt the outcome toward the Panthers in what could reasonably be expected to turn out as a lowerscoring game which will suit the Panthers fine
 Just like Taylor sang it In my mind Im going to Carolina Cant you see the sunshine cant you just feel the moonshine Aint it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind Yes Im going to Carolina in my mind
 Panthers 28 Broncos 24
