Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders likes to describe himself as a longtime supporter of marriage equalitymdashin sharp contrast to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton whorsquos still striving to convince her base that shersquos on board with LGBT rights In May Sanders famously told New York Times columnist Gail Collins that ldquoIrsquom not evolving when it comes to gay rights I was thererdquo Liberal outlets consistently describe Sanders as a pioneer for marriage equality As proof of his proLGBT credentials Sanders frequently touts his opposition in 1996 to the Defense of Marriage Act which barred the federal government from recognizing samesex marriages

But Sanders is not quite the gay rights visionary his defenders would like us to believe Sanders did oppose DOMAmdashbut purely on statesrsquo rights grounds And as recently as 2006 Sanders opposed marriage equality for his adopted home state of Vermont The senator may have evolved earlier than his primary opponents But the fact remains that in the critical early days of the modern marriage equality movement Sanders was neutral at best and hostile at worst

Like his current Senate colleague Sherrod Brown DOhio Sanders deserves credit for opposing DOMAmdashthen a popular measure with bipartisan supportmdashwhile a member of the House of Representatives in 1996 But Sandersrsquo efforts to parlay this vote into indisputable proof of his marriage equality bona fides ring hollow in light of his statements at the time Explaining his vote in 1996 Sandersrsquo chief of staff told the Rutland Heraldnbspthat Sandersrsquo vote was motivated by a concern for statesrsquo rights not equality Explaining that he wasnrsquot ldquolegislating valuesrdquo she noted that Sanders believed DOMA violated the Constitutionrsquos Full Faith and Credit Clause by allowing one state to refuse to recognize a samesex marriage performed in another ldquoYoursquore opening up Pandorarsquos box hererdquo she said told the Burlington Free Pressnbspat the time ldquoYoursquore saying that any state can refuse to hellip recognize the laws of another state if they donrsquot like themrdquo






Perhaps Sandersrsquo team used this statesrsquo rights rationale to limit backlash from antigay voters That would be a perfectly acceptable tactic since his votemdashnot his explanation of itmdashis what matters most Still if thatrsquos the case then Sanders should be honest about it Sandersrsquo rhetoric leads listeners to believe that the congressman championed gay rights and rebuked Congressrsquo homophobia during the DOMA debate But in his statements to the press at the time Sanders defended statesrsquo rights and made no mention of gay Americansrsquo dignity His vote may have been brave But it was hardly a fullthroated cry for equality






Ten years later Sanders took a similarly cautious approach to samesex marriage In 2006 he took a stand against samesex marriage in Vermont stating that he instead endorsed civil unions Sanders told the Associated Pressnbspthat he was ldquocomfortablerdquo with civil unions not full marriage equality To justify his stance Sanders complained that a battle for samesex marriage would be too ldquodivisiverdquo At the time he also opposed a federal antigaymarriage amendmentmdashbut so did his Republican opponent for the Senate seat Richard Tarrant who also supported civil unions With a wide lead in the polls and little at stake Sanders declined to differentiate himself from his opponent by taking the lead on gay rights






Earlier in his political career Sanders was even more indifferent toward gay rights which WJ Conroy recounts in his book Challenging the Boundaries of ReformnbspSocialism in Burlington When serving as mayor of Burlington Sanders told an interviewer that LGBT rights were not a ldquomajor priorityrdquo for him Asked if he would support a bill to protect gays from job discrimination Sanders responded ldquoprobably notrdquo That was 25 years ago Sanders has no doubt come a long way since then The senator endorsed Vermontrsquos successful Marriage Equality Act in 2009 and has cheered the Supreme Courtrsquos marriage rulings And he is cosponsoring the Equality Act a sweeping federal LGBT rights bill that advocacy groups place high on their postmarriage agendanbspnbsp











Still Sandersrsquo exaggeration of his marriage equality record is strange and unwise If Sanders were honest about his evolutionmdashand yes it was an evolutionmdashthen he could still brag about supporting marriage equality long before his chief primary rival Instead he has attempted to reframe his somewhat tepid support as vociferous and unabating The LGBTQ community can surely forgive Sandersrsquo lessthanspotless record on gay rightsmdashbut that process can only begin once hersquos honest about it And in the Democratic candidatesrsquo race to secure the gay communityrsquos vote honesty has been in surprisingly short supplynbsp
