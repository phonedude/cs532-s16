Super Bowl weekend is upon us and while some may have had their party menus planned out for days now judging from the jampacked supermarkets alone a majority of people probably save the cooking until last minute With so much going on during the week sometimes you have to wait until the day of the big game to do all your cooking but that doesnt mean you cant whip up some incredibly delicious snacks just moments before your guests arrive
 

Not only do the chefs over at Food Network come up with some of the best recipes but a lot of them are known for creating recipes that are flavorful while still being quick and easy to make Here are some of the best gameday eats that you can make this Sunday and the best part is they can all be prepped cooked and ready to go in less than 30 minutes
Triple Pork Sliders
Patrick and Gina Neely came up with these easy sliders that are perfect for any gameday Theyre topped with pork chorizo pepper jack cheese tomatoes bacon and a special smoked paprika mayo and only require about eight minutes of cooking Click herenbspfor recipe
