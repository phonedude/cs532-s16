said Our brand of democracy is hard A more accurate characterization might have been Our brand of democracy is cold hard cashCash mountains of it is increasingly the necessary tool for presidential candidates Several Powerball jackpots could already be fueled from the billions of dollars in contributions in play in election 2016 When considering the present donation season however the devil lies in the details which is why the details followWith three 2016 debates down and six more scheduled the two fundraisers with the most surprising amount in common are Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump Neither has billionaireinfused super PACs but for vastly different reasons Bernie has made it clear billionaires wont ever hold sway in his court While Trump8230 well you know hes not only a billionaire but has the knack for getting the sort of attention that even billions cant buyRegarding the rest of the field each candidate is counting on the reliability of his or her own arsenal of billionaire sponsors and corporate nabobs when the youknowwhat hits the fan And at this point believe it or not thanks to the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision of 2010 and the super PACs that arose from it all the billionaires arent even nailed down or faintly tapped out yet In fact some of them are already preparing to jump ship on their initial candidate of choice or reserving the really big bucks for closer to game time when only two nominees will be duking it out for the White HouseCapturing this drama of the billionaires in new ways are TV networks eager to profit from the latest eyeballgluing version of election politicking and the billions of dollars in ads that will flood onto screens nationwide between now and November 8th As super PACs billionaires and behemoth companies press their influence on what used to be called our democracy the modern debate system now a 16month food fight has become the political equivalent of the NFL playoffs In turn soaring ratings numbers scads of ads and the party infighting that helps generate them now translate into billions of new dollars for media mogulsFor your amusement and mine this being an allfunallthetime election campaign lets examine the relationships between our twentyfirstcentury plutocrats and the contenders who have raised 5 million or more in individual contributions or through super PACs and are at 5 or more incomposite national polls Ill refrain from using the politically correct phrases that feed into the illusion of distance between super PACs that allegedly support candidates causes and the candidates themselves because in practice there is no distinctionOn the Republican Side1 Ted Cruz Most GodFearing BillionairesYes its true the Texas senator goofed in neglecting to disclose to the Federal Election Commission FEC a tiny sixfigure loan from Goldman Sachs for his successful 2012 Senate campaign After all whats halfamillion dollars between friends especially when the investment bank that offered it also employed your wife as well as your finance chairman As The Donald recently told a crowd in Iowa when it comes to Ted Cruz Goldman Sachs owns him Remember that folks They own himThat aside with a slew of wealthy Christians in his camp Cruz has raised the second largest pile of money among the GOP candidates His total of individual and PAC contributions so far disclosed is a striking 652 million Of that 1428 million has already been spent Individual contributors kicked in about a third of that total or 2657 million as of the end of November 2015 8212 11 million from small donors and 152 million from larger ones His five top donor groups are retirees lawyers and law firms health professionals miscellaneous businesses and securities and investment firms including of course Goldman Sachs to the tune of 43575Cruzs Keep the Promise super PAC continues to grow like an action movie franchise It includes his original Keep the Promise PAC augmented by Keep the Promise I II and III Collectively the Keep the Promise super PACs amassed 3783 million In terms of deploying funds against his adversaries they have spent more than 10 times as much fighting Marco Rubio as battling Hillary ClintonHis super PAC money divides along family factions reminiscent of Game of Thrones A 15 million chunk comes from the billionaire Texas evangelical fracking moguls the Wilks Brothers and 10 million comes from Toby Neugebauer who is also listed as the principal officer of the public charityMatthew 620 Foundation its motto is Support the purposes of the Christian CommunityCruzs super PACs also received 11 million from billionaire Robert Mercer coCEO of the New Yorkbased hedge fund Renaissance Technologies His contribution is however peanuts compared to the 68 billion a Senate subcommittee accused Renaissance of shielding from the Internal Revenue Service an allegation Mercer is still fighting Hows that for New York values No wonder Cruz wants to abolish the IRSAnother of Cruzs contributors is Bob McNair the real estate mogul billionaire owner of the National Football Leagues Houston Texans and selfdescribed Christian steward2 Marco Rubio Most Diverse BillionairesSenator Marco Rubio of Florida has raised 328 million from individual and PAC contributions and spent about 9 million Despite the personal economic struggles hes experienced and loves to talk about hes not exactly resonating with the nations downtrodden hence his weak polling figures among the little people Billionaires of all sorts however seem to love himThe bulk of his money comes from super PACs and large contributors Small individual contributors donated only 33 million to his coffers larger individual contributions provided 113 million Goldman Sachs leads his pack of corporate donors with 79600His main super PAC Conservative Solutions has raised 166 million making it the third largest cash cow behind those of Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz It holds 5 million from Braman Motorcars 3 million from the Oracle Corporation and 25 million from Benjamin Leon Jr of Besilu Stables Those horses are evidently betting on RubioHe has also amassed a healthy roster of billionaires including the hedgefund vulture of Argentina Paul Singer who was the thirdranked conservative donor for the 2014 election cycle Last October in a mass email to supporters about a preIowa caucus event Singer promised Anyone who raises 10800 in new primary money will receive 5 VIP tickets to a rally and 5 tickets to a private reception with MarcoAnother of Rubio8217s Billionaire Boys is Norman Braman the Florida auto dealer and his mentor These days hes been forking over the real money but back in 2008 he gave Florida International University 100000 to fund a Rubio postFlorida statehouse teaching job What makes Bramans relationship particularly intriguing is his intense distaste for Jeb Bush Rubios former political mentor and now political punching bag Hatred in other words is paying dividends for RubioRounding out his top three billionaires is Oracle CEO Larry Ellison who ranks third on Forbess billionaire list Last summer he threw a 2700 per person fundraiser in his Woodside California compound for the candidate complete with a special dinner for couples that raised 27000 If Rubio somehow pulls it out you can bet he will be the Republican poster boy for Silicon Valley3 Jeb Bush Most Disappointed BillionairesAlthough the onetime Republican frontrunners star now looks more like a black hole the coffers of Jeb are still the ones to beat He had raised a total of 128 million by late November and spent just 199 million of it Essentially none of Jebs money came from the little people that is us Barely 4 of his contributions were from donations of 200 or lessIn terms of corporate donors eight of his top 10 contributors are banks or from the financial industry including all of the Big Six banks Goldman Sachs which is nothing if not generous to just about every candidate in sight 8212 except of course Bernie tops his corporate donor chart with 192500 His super PACs still kick ass compared to those of the other GOP contenders His Right to Rise super PAC raised a hefty 1032 million and despite his disappearing act in the polls it remains by far the largest in the fieldCorporate donors to Jebs Right to Rise PAC include MBF Healthcare Partners founder and chairman Mike Fernandez who has financed a slew of antiTrump ads with 302 million and Rooney Holdings with 22 million Its CEO L Francis Rooney III was the man George W Bush appointed ambassador to the Vatican Former AIG CEO Hank Greenbergs current company CV Starr and not as he has made pains to clarify he himself gave 10 million to Jebs super PAC In the same Fox Business interviewwhere he stressed that distinction he also noted Im sorry he is not living up to expectations but thats the reality of it AIG by the way received 182 billion in bailout money under Jebs brother W4 Ben Carson No Love For BillionairesBen Carson is running a pretty expensive campaign which doesnt reflect well on his possible future handling of the economy though as he sinks toward irrelevance in the polls it seems as if his moment to handle anything may have passed Having raised 387 million hes spent 264 million of it His campaign received 63 of its contributions from small donors which leaves it third behind Bernie and Trump on that score according to FEC filings from October 2015His main super PACs grouped under the title the 2016 Committee raised just 38 million with rich retired people providing the bulk of it Another PAC Our Childrens Future didnt collect anything despite its pledge to turn 8220Carsons outside militia into an organized army8221But billionaires arent Carsons cup of tea As he said last October I have not gone out licking the boots of billionaires and specialinterest groups Im not getting into bed with themCarson recently dropped into fourth place in the RealClearPolitics composite poll for election 2016 with his team in chaos His campaign manager Barry Bennett quit His finance chairman Dean Parke resignedamid escalating criticism over his spending practices and his 20000 a month salary As the rising outsider candidate Carson once had an opportunity to offer a fresh voice on campaign finance reform Instead his campaign learned the hard way that being in the Republican hot seat without a Rolodex of billionaires can be hell on Earth5 Chris Christie Most Sketchy BillionairesFor someone polling so low New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has amassed startling amounts of dosh His campaign contributions stand at 186 million of which he has spent 57 million Real people dont care for him Christie has received the least number of small contributions in either party a bargain basement 3 of his totalOn the other hand his super PAC America Leads raised 11 million including 43 million from the securities and investment industry His top corporate donors at 1 million each include Point 72 Asset Management theSteven and Alexandra Cohen Foundation and Winnecup Gamble Ranch run by billionaire Paul Fireman chairman of Fireman Capital Partners and founder and former chairman of Reebok International Ltd

hedgefund company due to insidertrading charges SAC had to pay 12 billion to settleChristies other helpful billionaire is Ken Langone cofounder of Home Depot But Langone as he told the National Journal is not writing a 10 million check Instead he says his preferred method of subsidizing politicians is getting a lot of people to write checks and get them to get people to write checks and hopefully result in a helluva lot more than 10 million In other words Langone offers his ultrawealthy network not himself6 Donald Trump I Am A BillionaireTrumps campaign has received approximately 58 million in individual contributions and spent about the same amount Though not much compared to the other Republican contenders its noteworthy that 70 of Trumps contributions come from small individual donors the highest percentage among GOP candidates Its a figure that suggests it might not pay to underestimate Trumps grassroots support especially since hes getting significant amounts of money from people who know he doesnt need itLast July a Make America Great Again super PAC emerged but it shut downin October to honor Trumps no super PAC claim For Trump dealing with super PAC agendas would be a hassle unworthy of his time and ego He is after all the best billionaire trust him Besides with endorsements from luminaries like former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and a command of TV ratings thats beyond compare who needs a super PAC or even his own money of which hes so far spent remarkably littleOn The Democratic Side1 Hillary Clinton A Dynasty of BillionairesHillary and Bill Clinton earned a phenomenal 139 million for themselves between 2007 and 2014 chiefly from writing books and speaking to various highpaying Wall Street and international corporations Between 2013 and 2015 Hillary Clinton gave 12 speeches to Wall Street banks private equity firms and other financial corporations pocketing a whopping 2935000 And shes used that obvious moneyraising skill to turn her campaign into a fundraising machineAs of October 16 2015 she had pocketed 9787 million from individual and PAC contributions And she sure knows how to spend it too Nearly half of that sum or 498 million 8212 more than triple the amount of any other candidate 8212 has already gone to campaign expensesSmall individual contributions made up only 17 of Hillarys total 81 came from large individual contributions Much like her forced folksiness in the early days of her campaign when she was snapped eating a burrito bowl at a Chipotle in her first major meetthefolks venture in Ohio those figures reveal a certain lack of savoir faire when it comes to the struggling classesStill despite her speaking tour up and down Wall Street and the fact that fourof the top six Wall Street banks feature among her top 10 career contributors theyve been holding back so far in this election cycle or perhaps donating to the GOP instead After all campaign 2008 was a bust for her and nobody likes to be on the losing side twiceHer largest super PAC Priorities USA Action nonetheless raised 157 million including 46 million from the entertainment industry and 31 million from securities and investment The Saban Capital Group and DreamWorks kicked in 2 million eachHillary has recently tried to distance herself from a welldeserved reputation for being close to Wall Street despite the megaspeaking fees shes garnered from Goldman Sachs among others not to speak of the fact that five of the Big Six banks gave money to the Clinton Foundation She now claims that her Wall Street plan is stricter than Bernie Sanderss It isnt Hes advocating to break up the big banks via a twentyfirstcentury version of the GlassSteagall Act that Bill Clinton buried in his presidency To top it off she scheduled an elite fundraiser at the 17 billion alternative investment firm Franklin Square Capital Partners four days before the Iowa Caucus So much for leopards changing spotsYou wont be surprised to learn that Hillary has billionaires galore in her corner all of whom backed her hubby through the years Chief among them is media magnate Haim Saban who gave her super PAC 2 million George Soros the hedgefund mogul contributed 202 million DreamWorks Animation chief executive Jeffrey Katzenberg gave 1 million And the list goes on2 Bernie Sanders No Billionaires AllowedBernie Sanders has stuck to his word running a campaign sans billionaires As of October 2015 he had raised an impressive 415 million and spent about 145 million of itNone of his top corporate donors are Wall Street banks Whats more a record 77 of his contributions came from small individual donors a number that seems only destined to grow as his legions of enthusiasts vote with their personal checkbooksAccording to a Sanders campaign press release as the year began another 33 million came in during the last three months of 2015 The tally for the yearend quarter pushed his total raised last year to 73 million from more than 1 million individuals who made a record 25 million donations That number broke the 2011 record set by President Obamas reelection committee by 300000 donations and evidence suggests Sanderss individual contributors arent faintly tapped out After recent attacks on his singlepayer healthcare plan by the Clinton camp he raised 14 million in a single day

                            It would of course be an irony of ironies if what has been a billionaires playground since the Citizens United decision became in November a billionaires graveyard with literally billions of plutocratic dollars interred in a grave marked here lies campaign 2016The Media and DebatesAnd talking about billions in some sense the true political and financial playground of this era has clearly become the television set with a record 6 billion in political ads slated to flood Americas screen lives before next November 8th Add to that the staggering rates that media companies have been getting for ad slots on TVs latest reality extravaganza 8212 those debates that began in mid2015 and look as if theyll never end They have sometimes pulled in National Football Leaguesized audiences and represent an entertainment and profit spectacle of the highest orderSo heres a little rundown on those debates thus far winners and losers and Im not even thinking of the candidates though Donald Trump would obviously lead the list of winners so far 8212 just ask him In those ratings extravaganzas especially the Republican ones the lack of media questions on campaign finance reform and on the influence of billionaires is striking 8212 and little wonder under the moneymaking circumstancesThe GOP ShowThe kickoff August 6th GOP debate in Cleveland Ohio was a Fox News triumph Bringing in 24 million viewers it was the highestrated primary debate in TV history The followup at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley California on September 16th hosted by CNN and Salem Radio grabbed another 231 million viewers making it the mostwatched program in CNN8217s history Trump naturally took credit for that CNN charged up to 200000for a 30second spot An average primetime spot on CNN usually goes for 5000 The third debate hosted by CNBC attracted 14 million viewers a record for CNBC which was by then charging advertisers 250000 or more for 30second spotsFox Business News and the Wall Street Journal hosted the next round on November 10th 135 million viewers and hohum a Fox Business News record For that one175000 bought you a 30second commercial slotThe fifth and final debate of 2015 on December 15th in Las Vegas again hosted by CNN and Salem Radio lassoed 18 million viewers As 2016 started debate fatigue finally seemed to be setting in The first debate on January 14th in North Charleston South Carolina scored a mere 11 million viewers for Fox Business News When it came to the second debate and the last before the Iowa caucuses on January 28th The Donald decided not to grace it with his presence because he didn8217t think Fox News had treated him nicely enough and because he loathes its host Megyn KellyThe Democratic DebatesRelative to the GOP debate admoney mania CNN charged a bargain halfoff or100000 for a 30second ad during one of the Democratic debates Lets face it lacking a reality TV star at center stage the Democrats and associated advertisers generally fared less well Their first debate on October 13th in Las Vegas hosted by CNN and Facebook averaged a respectable 153 million viewers but the next one in Des Moines Iowa overseen by CBS and the Des Moines Register sank to just 86 million viewers Debate number three in Manchester New Hampshire hosted by ABC and WMUR was rumored to have been buried by the Democratic National Committee evidently trying to do Hillary a favor on the Saturday night before Christmas Not surprisingly it brought in only 785 million viewersThe fourth Democratic debate on NBC on January 17th streamed live on YouTube featured the intensifying battle between an energized Bernie and a spooked Hillary It garnered 102 million TV viewers and another 23 million YouTube viewers even though it too had been buried 8212 on the Sunday night before Martin Luther King Jr Day In comparison 60 Minutes on rival network CBS nabbed203 million viewersThe UpshotSo what gives In this election season its clear that these skirmishes involving the ultrawealthy and their piles of cash are transforming modern American politics into a form of theater And the correlation between big money and big drama seems destined only to rise The media needs to fill its coffers between now and election day and the competition among billionaires has something of a horsebetting quality to it Once upon a time candidates drummed up interest in their policies now their policies such as they are have been condensed into so many buzzwords and phrases while money and glitz are the main currencies attracting attentionThat said it could all go awry for the moneyclass and wouldnt that just be satisfying to witness 8212 the irony of an election won not by but despite all those billionaires and corporate patronsWill Bernies citizens beat Hillarys billionaires Will Trump go billion to billion with fellow New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg Will Cruzs prayers be answered Will Rubio score a 12th round knockout of Cruz and Trump Does Jeb Bush even exist And to bring up a question few are likely to ask What do the American people and our former democratic republic stand to lose or gain from this spectacle All this and more and more and more money will be revealed later this year
