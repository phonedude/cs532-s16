    Itrsquos not easy to get owls to mug for the camera Even in captivity the birds remain aloof unruffled by the flash and unmoved by attempts to bribe them Photographer Brad Wilson learned that lesson firsthand after trying to win over owls from the World Bird Sanctuary in St Louis and The Wildlife Center near Espaola New Mexico He spent hours with each bird trying to capture its direct gaze ldquoItrsquos hard to get animals to look at you like humans dordquo he says ldquoThat shot became my holy grailrdquo

Wilson is an expert at pointblank portraits His series ldquoAffinityrdquo features 65 species including a white rhino a white tiger an Arctic fox and an Egyptian Vulture But owls were the most compelling and challenging subjects he says It takes years of building mutual trust before an owl will accept physical contact from a single person says Wilson and ldquoowls donrsquot extend that privilege to other humansrdquo

Wilson wanted his images to accentuate the nobility and independence of each captive bird minimizing its dependence on its caretaker Many had wing injuries for example which he concealed in his pictures The owlsrsquo human perches likewise hid themselves contorting their bodies to stay out of the frame It was a gesture to the birds a way of saying that although their wild days are behind them they still have their dignitynbsp

Western ScreechOwl

Size 79 inches tall less than half a pound

Range Southeastern Alaska through western Canada and the western US to central Mexico

Status Least Concern

The Western ScreechOwl plays host to a surprising houseguest blind snakesmdashwormlike reptiles that dwell undergroundmdashthat the owls ferry live back to their nests This unlikely act of mercy is actually a childrearing strategy Parents that share their nests with the strange bedfellows have better success at raising young Thatrsquos because the snakes devour pests like ants and flies whose larvae consume food reserved for owlets

Barn Owl

Size Up to 15 inches tall 1 pound

Range The worldrsquos most cosmopolitan owl nests on six continents but avoids the northernmost reaches of North America Europe and Asia

Status Least Concern

The constellation of spots that spreads across the Barn Owlrsquos head and dcolletage are not just ornamental The more spots a female has the more resistant she seems to be to parasites and the more attractive she is to males A seemingly supernatural ability to pinpoint noises and spot prey in lowlight and even blackout conditions coupled with nearsoundless flight makes these owls the perfect night stalkers

Eurasian EagleOwl

Size 2329 inches tallnbsp39 pounds

Range Europe and Asia

Status Least Concern

No bird is safe from the Eurasian EagleOwlmdashnot even its kin The mighty strigiform goes after Tawny and Snowy owls as well as such larger birds as Gray Herons On Chinarsquos alpine meadows the eagleowl and the Upland Buzzard hunt the same voles and beadyeyed pikas The buzzards conduct their business by day the owls take over after dusk With its 65foot wingspan itrsquos also been known to hunt foxes and fawns

Eastern ScreechOwl

Size 610 inches tallnbspless than half a pound

Range East of the Rocky Mountains US to northeastern Mexico

Status Least Concern

The Eastern ScreechOwl can thrive in the most chaotic urban environments It is one of the few raptors to live in New York City including in Central Park in the middle of Manhattan where the species was reintroduced To coexist so closely with civilization the screechowl has learned to skim off songbirds at feeders and squat in humancreated crannies Still the streetsmart bird remains secretive stymying ornithologists eager to learn more about itnbsp

Flammulated Owl

Size 6 inches tallnbsp2 ounces though females are 50 percent heavier when breeding

Range Common in summer from southwestern Canada through the western US to Mexico winter range in Mexico is poorly known

Status Least Concern

The Flammulated Owlrsquos husky voice doesnrsquot quite fit its pintsized body It can slow down its vocal vibrations by slackening the layers of skin around its throat creating a lowpitched hoot In spring and summer the owl idles in western mountains feasting on insects It was once thought not to migrate but its insectivorous habits and recent studies showing that itrsquos unable to go into torpor or mini hibernation confirm that it travels south in winter

Great Horned Owl

Size 152 feet tallnbsp35 pounds

Range All of continental North America and much of South America

Status Least Concern

Great Horned Owls are natural foster parents A single female in captivity has been known to play surrogate to more than a hundred owlets in her lifetime In the wild these birds are just as nurturing with females keeping constant tabs on their young When it comes to territoriality however tenderness turns to ferocity Couples will fend off neighbors through hooting contests and even set upon them with fistfuls of talons

Longeared Owl

Size 15 inches tall half a pound

Range North America Europe Asia and locally in North Africa with some wintering south to Mexico and southern China

Status Least Concern

The Longeared Owl is a frequent target for other birds of prey including Great Horned Owls and Barred Owls When facing a formidable threat it has a few tricks up its wing It might pull in its plumage and stand up straight elongating its body to look more imposing The small owl may also sway side to side feign an injury or flop around its nest while screeching owlish imprecations

Mexican Spotted Owl

Size 18 inches tall 1 pound

Range From Mexico north through Arizona and New Mexico to Utah and Colorado

Status Near Threatened

Of the three Spotted Owl subspecies the Mexican is the rarest one in the US Highly localized within its wide range it seeks out cool shady canyons often in areas surrounded by the hot dry slopes of desert mountains It doesnrsquot breed every year when it does it prefers spacious tree hollows in oldgrowth trees If such sites arenrsquot available the bird will adopt secondhand nests of other birds or occupy shallow caves in canyon cliffs

Spectacled Owl

Size 18 inches tall 12 pounds

Range Mexico and Central America to the northern twothirds of South America

Status Least Concern

The Spectacled Owl has little to fear from predators since it roosts in the canopies of rainforests and gallery woods where assailants are few It eats almost anything during one lurid encounter in Panama one slaughtered a threetoed sloth then feasted on its mangled body The bird is aptly named for the banditlike mask around its eyesmdashblack spectacles on a fleecy white head for the young white frames on a dark head for adults
