And then there were two The Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers won their respective conferences and are set to face each other in Super Bowl 50 at Levis Stadium in Santa Clara The game will be televised on CBS with Jim Nantz and Phil Simms on the call

  
  
    
  


The Broncos knocked off the defending champion New England Patriots 2018 in the AFC Championship Peyton Manning threw two touchdowns to Owen Daniels but otherwise the 40yearold quarterback played game manager with his defense putting on an inspired performance Tom Brady was harassed all day by Denvers defense which sacked him four times and forced two interceptions
Still Brady nearly completed a comeback thanks to Rob Gronkowski who made a brilliant catch on fourth down to save the Patriots last drive and scored a touchdown to make it 2018 However the Patriots twopoint conversion failed sending Manning to the Super Bowl for the third time in his career
The Panthers had little trouble taking care of the Arizona Cardinals They jumped out to a 170 lead in the first quarter and eventually ran away with the 4915 victory Cam Newton threw two touchdowns and ran for two more while the defense terrorized Carson Palmer Palmer melted down with four interceptions one of which was returned for a touchdown by Luke Kuechly He also lost two fumbles It was a disappointing finish for Palmer who played at an MVP level for most of the year
