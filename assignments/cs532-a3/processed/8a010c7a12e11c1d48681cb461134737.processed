							WASHINGTON  Hillary Clintons longtime aide said her boss is often confused and needs plenty of guidance to understand the schedule according to fresh emails out Monday
Judicial Watch a conservative watchdog group released new emails from Huma Abedin that show her concern among her State Department staff on making sure Clinton knew whom to call
In one email exchange on Jan 26 2013 Abedin asks fellow staffer Monica Hanley whether Clinton knows to call Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
Hanley replies She was in bed for a nap by the time I heard that she had an 8am call Will go over with her
Abedin stresses the importance of reviewing the schedule with Clinton Very imp to do that Shes often confused
Its not the first time the word confused has been used to describe the Democratic presidential frontrunner and former top diplomat Clinton herself admits she gets confused and even apologizes to her staff for mixups while she was secretary of state
The emails Clinton kept on her private email server and turned over to the State Department reveal a Clinton who is often stumped by technology  needing help with mobile devices faxes and calls A Post review of the disclosed emails shows shes also confused by her schedule
On May 31 2010 Clinton emailed Abedin on the timing of her meetings and travel scheduleAfter a backandforth over the time she writes Ok but Im confused since I remember talking w Lona about changing to 8 tonight

On Sept 23 2009 Clinton is emailing with chief of staff Cheryl Mills about an upcoming State Department senior leadership retreat After reviewing the draft agenda Clinton was thrown by whether Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg would be there for an earlier presentation Im confused8211will he be there in am Can he be urged to reschedule whatever else he has and come
Judicial Watch had filed several federal lawsuits for access to emails from Clintons private email server including those of Abedin
Huma Abedins description of Hillary Clinton as easily confused tells you all you need to know why it took a federal lawsuit to get these government emails from Clintons illegal email server Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement
In emails Clinton turned over herself to the State Department she apologizes several times for confusing her staff
In an email to Daniel Baer on Dec 13 2009 Clinton said sorry for not making her edits clear on an upcoming speech I just looked at the first page and noticed I hadnt crossed out the last typed line8211did that confuse you
The emails show how Clinton who is often perceived as polished and rehearsed makes mistakes when emailing about foreign affairs
A day earlier Dec 12 2009 Clinton apologized for confusing Guinea and Morocco in an email She sends a note to three staffers including Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman Good catch Jeff Yes8211two issues there will be a contact group about Guinea that the French want us to be strong on too Sorry for the confusion

      We had Ronald Reagan with Alzheimers yet they still call him The Great Communicator his speeches were written for him toobut he was an actor by trade so maybe his delivery was viewed as better weve had presidents fall asleep during meetings with dignitaries weve had George W who always looked surprised or confused about what was going on and surprised himself when he thought he said something correctly With as hectic a schedule as campaigning politicians and serving public officials have Republican or Democrat that is why they have assistants to keep things straight for them Tentoone this aides statement was taken out of context and made to look like something else that anyone who is looking for something to nitpick over can jump on and make more of it than it is It happens on both sides of the campaign fencealways has and it deflects from focusing on the real issues facing this country

      Obama The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of IslamPresident Obama addressed the General Assembly of theUnited Nations in New York on Tuesday morning and while there were a fewmoments when he at least talked a good game on free speech there were alsomoments that left much to be desired on that same front and on the real natureof the root causes of unrest in the Middle EastHere are some key excerpts you can read the fullprepared remarks hereBut the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America They arealso an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully that diplomacycan take the place of war and that in an interdependent world all of us havea stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizensIf we are serious about upholding these ideals itwill not be enough to put more guards in front of an Embassy or to put outstatements of regret and wait for the outrage to pass If we are serious aboutthose ideals we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisisBecause we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart and thehopes we hold in commonToday we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens and not by his killers Today we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our UnitedNations So far not bad But then for some reason the president felt the need to bring in criticize and apologize for the YouTubevideo that were to believe was the catalyst that sparked theseinexcusable recent events  even though really that video is not what any ofthis is or should be about at all and Im not really sure why its somethingthe president feels the continual need to explain awayThat is what we saw play out the last two weeks asa crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world Ihave made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do withthis video and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect ourcommon humanity It is an insult not only to Muslims but to America as well for as the city outside these walls makes clear we are a country that haswelcomed people of every race and religion We are home to Muslims who worshipacross our country We not only respect the freedom of religion  we have lawsthat protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or whatthey believe We understand why people take offense to this video becausemillions of our citizens are among themI know there are some who ask why we dont just bansuch a video The answer is enshrined in our laws our Constitution protectsthe right to practice free speech Here in the United States countlesspublications provoke offense Like me the majority of Americans are Christianand yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs Moreover asPresident of our country and CommanderinChief of our military I accept thatpeople are going to call me awful things every day and I will always defendtheir right to do so Americans have fought and died around the globe toprotect the right of all people to express their views  even views that wedisagree withAgain not a bad rundown of our freespeech valuesbut if we believe that all people have a right to express their views evenones with which we disagree why are we still talking about this dumbvideo The video is not the point The Obama administration has alreadyhad to revise their original version of the chaos in Libya and labeled it as the terrorismthat it was but President Obama conspicuously failed to mention terrorism inrelation to Libya in his speech Why do I feel like this was a speech designedto sound soso on promoting our American values but simultaneously pander tothe people who would criticize us for them There was an opportunity for a realdisplay of strength and courage here in the wake of all of this unacceptableviolence and the president declined to take itposted at 201 pm onSeptember 25 2012 by Erika JohnsenTo see the videos noted you will have to go to  hotaircomarchives20120925obamathefuturemustnotbelongtothosewhoslandertheprophetofislam

      Hillary fell and bumped her head in the fall of 2012 and was not well enough to testify on BenGhazi for weeks Of course she did not go to the hospital and let her personal physician care for her injury so we dont know the extent of the injury to her head The not going to the hospital part makes honest people wonder whether she really hurt her head or lied about it to delay the hearing  If she really hurt her head to the extent that she could not testify for weeks that is troubling as closed head injuries can do bad things to behavior memory etc If on the other hand she lied about the injury to delay the hearing thats equally as troubling given what it says about her  Note also that later in that same month several weeks after not going to the hospital but being treated only by her personal physician she was hospitalized for a blood clot of undisclosed location but supposedly related to her fall Given the length of time between the injury and receiving a full hosptial exam one wonders if the most likely brain related blood clot caused any long term impairment  If she did actually fall and is either theater or newsyahoocomhillaryclintonhospitalizedbloodclot010436117politicshtml

      The false god of politics and progressive economics

If you visit Mount Olympus you will see scores of crumbling
statues to false gods once worshipped by ancient Greeks The same is true in
Rome where statues of political gods notably those named Caesar lay in
ruins



We are more sophisticated today Moderns dont bow to Zeus Many
of us though put our faith in the false god of politics despite its track
record of not being able to achieve all of the things we project upon it



The late comedian George Carlin may have put the blame for this
where it belongs Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large
groups



In order to accurately judge an idea policy or individual
stupid one must first have a standard by which stupid can be measured



Now comes two farleft politicians who apparently believe their
philosophy is not receiving the worship it is due despite a track record of
failure Hillary Clinton continues to move left jettisoning positions she once
held  from support of the Iraq War to her evolving stance on samesex
marriage  believing voters headed that way will put her in the White House



New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has oneupped Hillary Clinton
by publishing a 13point plan he calls The Progressive Agenda to Combat Income
Inequality which some have compared to Newt Gingrichs 1994 Contract with
America De Blasios proposal though might be likened to a contract hit on
America



As The Economist noted de Blasios plan is short on detail
such as how to pay for anything but big on vision it calls for raising the
federal minimum wage to 15 an hour and indexing it to inflation bolstering
unions bringing in national paid sick and family leave and universal
prekindergarten ending tax breaks for firms outsourcing overseas and closing
tax loopholes for the rich



Where to begin Not worrying about paying for anything is
classic liberalism If they arent raising taxes they are borrowing money from
China to achieve their vision though its more like a mirage



The minimum wage has been converted into something it was never
intended to be  a permanent salary regarded as the chief support for a
workers family long term Instead it should be taken for what it is an
entrylevel position that gives workers an opportunity to move up to a better
job at higher pay taking full advantage of advanced training programs offered
to them



Raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour however may result in
robots replacing workers Food will be ordered from a computer at your table
Its already happening in some restaurants



Bolstering unions means more workers paying more dues so more
unions can give more money to the Democratic Party



National paid sick leave Why do liberals focus so much on time
off instead of productivity Such a policy would be ripe for abuse



Preschool if its public and made mandatory by politicians
would give liberals an even earlier start at shaping young minds into their
political and social image by getting kids attuned to the things liberals
believe to be true Many argue that the progressive outlook seeks to undermine
the authority of parents and teach that government is good especially when
headed by Democrats Parents not politicians are the ultimate deciders on
how and where their children should be educated School choice is the answer
Providing vouchers lets parents sidestep failing public schools and the
indoctrination in favor of an academic environment that offers a better
education and less brainwashing



The answer to firms that outsource jobs overseas is to reform a
tax structure that has caused them to flee the country Ditto on loopholes A
flat tax or fair tax eliminates all loopholes and most deductions and would
free up capital that would produce more investment at home leading to more
jobs more people working and more tax revenue



Though false gods cant deliver stupid people still act as if
they can Republican presidential candidates must have a message that will
bring Americans to their senses and remind them of economic foreign policy and
moral standards that once produced results

      The Second Coming

TURNING and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer

Things fall apart the centre cannot hold

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world

The blooddimmed tide is loosed and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned

The best lack all conviction while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity  



Surely some revelation is at hand

Surely the Second Coming is at hand

The Second Coming Hardly are those words out

When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

Troubles my sight somewhere in sands of the desert

A shape with lion body and the head of a man

A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun

Is moving its slow thighs while all about it

Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds

The darkness drops again but now I know

That twenty centuries of stony sleep

Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle

And what rough beast its hour come round at last

Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born

      Al Qaeda is back in Iraq because President Obama and Hillary
Clinton chose not to block them

Sunday June 22 2014
 posted by Hugh Hewitt 

As alQaedastan takes shape carved from parts of two
countries and with ambitions far greater than the parts of Iraq and Syria it
already owns many Americans are wondering how President Obama and his pair of
foreign policy gurus Hillary Clinton and John Kerry could have allowed this to
happen



How could an al Qaeda so devastated by drone attacks and the
death of its titular head be thriving especially in western Iraq where the
Anbar Awakening had combined with George W Bushs famed surge to stabilize
the region and allow for traditional tribal rulers to return to influence and
reestablish order



The answer of course is that America cut and ran It refused
to negotiate a status of forces agreement that would have provided for a
residual force of 10000 to 20000 American troops  an agreement along the
lines of one that George W Bush had negotiated through 2011 Instead of
negotiating Obama and Clinton simply withdrew leaving a vacuum into which the
transnational terrorists that fly the al Qaeda black flag flooded



Both Obama and Clinton found ways to tell everyone this past
week that the lack of a SOFA was Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri alMalikis fault
The president used a press conference and Clinton a CNN townhall to lay down
their markers as to why there was no SOFA and thus no residual force of
American troops to provide the glue the Iraqi army so obviously lacked this
past week



We didnt get that done Clinton told the country and
went on to blame Maliki The president followed suit later in the week each of
them eager to lay out a defense against the charge of deadly malpractice if the
forces of al Qaeda use these new conquests as a staging ground for attacks on
America



The Washington Posts Scott Wilson noticed the presidents
aboutface writing that throughout the campaign of 2012 the president
trumpeted the fact he had withdrawn all US forces from the country was a
problem solved and that this was  a political chip to be cashed in come
November



Wilson was one of the few to recall that in the presidential
debates of two years ago GOP nominee Mitt Romney had blasted the president for failing
to obtain a SOFA



With regards to Iraq you and I agreed I believe that
there should be a status of forces agreement Romney told Obama as the two
convened on the Lynn University campus in Boca Raton Fla that October
evening Thats not true Obama interjected Oh you didnt want a status of
forces agreement Romney asked as an argument ensued No Obama said What
I would not have done is left 10000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down
That certainly would not help us in the Middle East



Thank you Mr Wilson Case closed



Experts familiar with the failed SOFA negotiations know and
have said on the record it was ours for the having but ObamaClinton wouldnt
take it They didnt want it They wanted out and that is what they got



They also got alQaedastan They set up its setup



Let me be clear the president is fond of saying and on
this subject clarity is essential



Obama and Clinton inherited a peaceful stable democratic
Iraq from Bush They tossed aside that legacy for political reasons As the
whirlwind is reaped there and perhaps here as well that fact should be known
and repeated in every story



The return of al Qaeda to Iraq could have been prevented
Obama and Clinton chose not to do so









All of the people dying in Iraq
today are dying because Obama refused to try to obtain a status of forces of
agreement when leaving This is Hillary
Clinton and Barack Obamas fault 10000 US
troops at an air base would have sent a clear message to Iran to Syria to
Russia and would have given us a spring board to launch strikes from in moments

      Hillary
Clintons Hard Choices at State Department failed every time

Monday
June 9 2014  posted by Hugh Hewitt 

Hard
Choices former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons new memoir of her failed
presidential campaign and years at State promises to be hard going for
reviewers and the general public



The
entire book was given over to the New York Times which dutifully headlined
their scoop In Memoir Hillary Clinton Emphasizes Her Softer Side Talk
about faint praise The story on the leaked book oozes fatigue at having been
assigned to read it



Clinton
is surely running for president Just as surely she will tout her time at State
as great preparation her oversized memoir an unread testament to all that she
accomplished It is the job of every reporter and commentator to read Hard
Choices very carefully no matter how deadly dull because Clintons time at
State was quite simply deadly for many Americans and the countrys interests
abroad



When
Clinton gave her Russian counterpart a giant reset button that wasnt
actually labeled reset in Russian the episode foreshadowed four years of
missteps and pratfalls Of course the relationship with Russia went south for
four straight years and has culminated in Vladimir Putins seizure of all of
Crimea as opposed to just part of Georgia during President George W Bushs
lameduck months



So
too has the relationship with the Peoples Republic of China now adventuring
across the South China Sea engaged in serial confrontations with the Philippines
Japan and currently Vietnam as it bullies its way past a hollowedout American
military and a shattered diplomatic front despite the talk of pivots and new
resources for the region



Clinton
left all of the Middle East as she did Benghazi on the night of Sept 11 2012
 in flames and marked by death and confusion Egypt started as a pillar of
stability though not of reform and President Obama and Clinton helped turn it
into a suspicious if not openly hostile keystone state still an authoritarian
regime but one dancing with the Russian bear Syria is a hellhole the enormity
of which most Americans barely grasp and Lebanon Jordan and Iraq destabilized
by Syrian refugees even as Hezbollah shock troops fight the butcher Bashar
Assads war on commands from the nearnuclear Iran All of the facts on the
ground now took shape on Clintons watch



But
Clintons few defenders point to Myanmar and say See there Burma is now a
burgeoning democracy Produced by Hillarys patient attentions Even this
risible we will always have Burma defense collapsed last week when the New
York Times Nicholas Kristof returned from a reporting trip to the countrys
northwest and came back shocked by the ruthless apartheid there and the
prospect of a slowmotion genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority



Appearing
on my radio show Friday Kristof agreed that the index in Clintons memoir
would likely not feature an entry for Rohingya and also declared about Obama
that I think that its time when this kind of thing is happening I think
President Obama needs to speak out Secretary of State John Kerry especially
because as you say they do claim it as a foreignpolicy success And if
youre going to claim the success side of the ledger then youve got to own
that and push for an end to these kinds of just unbelievable atrocities



The
same standard applies to Clinton of course She owns the Burma horror as much
as she does the Syrian nightmare and Libyan bloody mess Of course she will
condemn the awful evils and offer justifications in a variety of patterns and
colors but her record at State is one of epic failure after epic failure Word
count and a dump truck load full of cliches and windy rhetoric cannot obscure
that record or how the world turned on her watch



Every
reporter and commentator who will opine on the election of 2016 owes the public
a duty to read Hard Choices closely and compare its claims to the realities
it will try to hide

      US

Hillary Clinton gave Sergei Lavrov a mock reset
button symbolising US hopes to mend frayed ties with Moscow 

But he said the word the Americans chose
peregruzka meant overloaded or
overcharged rather than reset 

Daily newspaper Kommersant declared on its front page
Sergei Lavrov and Hillary Clinton push the wrong button 

Relations between Washington
and Moscow have cooled in recent years over Russias role in the war in Georgia US support for the entry of Georgia and Ukraine
to Nato and the planned US
missile shield based in central Europe 

Was it right

Efforts to heal the rift got off to an awkward start on Friday
as the two sides met in Geneva
when Mrs Clinton presented Foreign Minister Lavrov with a green box tied in
green ribbon 

As reporters watched the US secretary of state assured her
Russian opposite number her staff had worked hard to ensure it was
accurate 

Was it right she inquired with a smile 

You got it wrong Mr Lavrov responded also smiling
before pointing out the mistake 

Despite
the embarrassment

the two made light of the moment in front of the cameras and
pushed the button together to signify a shared hope for better relations 

At a joint news conference after two hours of talks both joked
about the error 

We reached an agreement on how reset is spelled in both
Russian and English  we have no differences between us any more Mr
Lavrov said through an interpreter

Mrs Clinton put it this
way The minister corrected our word choice But in a way the word that
was on the button turns out to be also true 

We are resetting and because we are resetting the
minister and I have an overload of work 

The gift was a lighthearted reference to US VicePresident Joe
Bidens recent remark that the new US
administration wanted to reset ties with Russia after years of friction

      Is  Was Hillary Mentally Fit For
The Secretary Of State Positionor President

 I
wonder if the American Association of Psychologists and Psychiatrists consider
former US
Sec Of State Hillary an abused spouse Given that she accepted as well
as enabled Bill Clinton through repeated affairs is she psychologically
damaged 




If she is damaged what is the potential risk of having her in office in terms
of depression temperament etc  Is she or does she need any mood
altering drugs due to this ailment or for any other reason and if so what and
how often

Given
her fall in late 2012 and the alleged head injury she suffered that delayed her
House hearings for over a month one has additional reason to be concerned

      Is Hillary Anti Semitic

 
Before Hillary Clinton became a candidate for the US Senate she had been
quoted publicly justifying attacks on Israeli by groups such as Hamas as well
as other notorious Arab Terrorists In addition to those remarks she had
made statements criticizing the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin for deporting
as well as jailing known terrorists She had also chaired an Arab
committee which had a reception for all the ambassadors to the US in Washington
DC and yet she had no problem with the
exclusion of Israel
from that very reception 




After she became a candidate for The Senate she accepted large financial
contributions from her Arab affiliates who one can only assume hoped to elect
her so as to use her influence against the State of
Israel

 


Hillary Clinton is also a good friend of Al Sharpton a guy who has been quoted
as saying that the Jewish people exploit other New Yorkers 




Is Hillary AntiSemitic Given the criticality of Mid East Peace and our
strong relationship with Israel
we need to know and our media needs to ask her some tough questions

      Hillarys Record  Liberal

 
While Hillary Clinton may or may notysoon seek to once again fashion
herself as a centrist politician if she runs for the 2012 Democrat nomination
dont be fooled by the act Keep in mind that the The Americans for
Democratic Action ADA a lead liberal organization that issues annual
congressional voting ratings by reviewing the votes of our Congressmen on its
20 most critical issues has given the former Senator from NY and current
Secretary Of State scores which the ADA has cutely named liberal
quotients of 95 percent for each of her first three years on the job as
US Senator 




Keep in mind that her liberal mindset has allowed her to join Obama in his
World Apology Tour The latest example of that mindset was her middle
east visit after the Arizona Congresswoman shooting where she equated that
incident with Islamic terrorist fanatics proclaiming that we had our own
fanatics I guess in her liberal victimhood mindset she equates
religious fanatics bent on domination and destruction with a 22 year old
psychotic



After 5 trillion
in deficits in Obamas first 4 years and a lack of willingness to support the
constitution do we really need another ultra liberal in the White House after 8
years of Obama

      Clintons thick glasses are a result of health problems
from her fall in late 2012 Her own
political spin doctors are saying that the blurred vision she suffered from the
fall resulted in blurred vision that could last for weeks or even months

The fall was apparently
serious and closed head injuries that present as blurred vision symptoms such
as these call into question whether she has suffered other long term symptoms
such as memory loss emotional instability etc etc newsyahoocomhillaryclintonsglassesresulthealthproblems151047288html

  If she

 Is she or
does she need any mood altering drugs due to this ailment or for any other
reason and if so what and how often



Secretary

Hillary fell and bumped her head last fall and was not
well enough to testify on BenGhazi
for weeks Of course she did not go to
the hospital and let her personal physician care for her injury so we dont
know the extent of the injury to her head


The not going to the hospital part makes honest people
wonder whether she really hurt her head
or lied about it to delay the hearing
If she really hurt her head to the extent that she could not testify for
weeks that is troubling as closed head injuries can do bad things to behavior
memory etc If on the other hand she
lied about the injury to delay the hearing thats equally as troubling given
what it says about her

Note
also that later in that same month several weeks after not going to the
hospital but being treated only by her personal physician she was hospitalized
for a blood clot of undisclosed location but supposedly related to her
fall Given the length of time between
the injury and receiving a full hosptial exam one wonders if the most likely
brain related blood clot caused any long term impairment If she did actually fall and is either theater or
newsyahoocomhillaryclintonhospitalizedbloodclot010436117politicshtml

Update now that her own staff is alledging several months later that
she hit her head so hard that she will have need of thick glasses for blurred
vision for months on end we have to aks this question once again about HIllary
Clinton especially given the Clintons tendency to refuse to reveal their full
medical records

      Hillary Clinton says
businesses dont create jobs Uhoh



Hillary Clinton

said this at a
recent campaign event Dont let anybody tell you that its

corporations and
businesses that create jobs By Linda Feldmann

Staff writer October
27 2014 



Washington  Hillary
Rodham Clintons

recent comment about
trickledown economics has launched a war of spin



First heres what

the likely 2016
presidential candidate said at a campaign event last Friday

for Martha Coakley

the Massachusetts
Democratic gubernatorial candidate



Dont let anybody
tell you that its corporations and businesses

that create jobs
former Secretary of State Clinton said in Boston You know

that old theory
trickledown economics That has been tried that has failed

It has failed rather
spectacularly One of the things my husband says when

people say What
did you bring to Washington He says I brought arithmetic





That first sentence
is similar to a gaffe President Obama made in

his 2012 reelection
campaign when he said If youve got a business  you

didnt build that
Somebody else made that happen His GOP opponent Mitt Romney

pounded him
mercilessly over that one though Mr Romney still lost



Its Hillary
Clintons You Didnt Build That Moment  and its

a safe bet that the
quote will come back to haunt her writes Benjamin Austin at

FreePatriotorg



Regardless of how
one interprets Clintons comment theres little

doubt the former
first ladys opponents will use it against her in the

presidential
campaign if she runs



Its not Clintons
first gaffe of the unofficial 2016 race This

past June when she
released her latest book Hard Choices she said she and

her husband the
expresident came out of the White House in 2001 dead

broke For a couple
that could instantly command multimilliondollar book

deals and sixfigure
speaking gigs the comment seemed strangely off PolitiFact com rated it

      Report Clintons State Department Refused To List Group
That Kidnapped Nearly 300 Teen Girls Terrorists part 1 of 2

 Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called
the kidnapping of nearly 300 girls in Nigeria by an Islamic extremist group an act
of terrorism and accused the Nigerian government on Wednesday of being
somewhat derelict in protecting its people

Clinton speaking at a philanthropy conference in New York
forcefully urged the Nigerian government to do everything it can to bring the
captive girls home safely and accept help from the United States and other
nations

The seizure of these young women by this radical extremist
group Boko Haram is abominable its criminal its an act of terrorism and
it really merits the fullest response possible first and foremost by the
government of Nigeria Clinton said in an interview with ABC News Robin
Roberts at Philanthropy New York

Despite her strong stance the State Department under
Clinton reportedly refused to label the extremist group as terrorists

The Daily Beast reports that the State Department refused to
place the group on the official list of terrorist organizations in 2011 after
Boko Haram bombed the United Nations headquarters in Abuja

The one thing she could have done the one tool she had at
her disposal she didnt use And nobody can say she wasnt urged to do it
Its gross hypocrisy a former senior US official told The Daily Beast The
FBI the CIA and the Justice Department really wanted Boko Haram designated
they wanted the authorities that would provide to go after them and they
voiced that repeatedly to elected officials

Republicans say that if the Clintonled State Department
labeled Boko Haram a terrorist group that the search for the kidnapped girls
could have started sooner

For years Boko Haram has terrorized Nigeria and Western
interests in the region with few consequences Sen James Risch RIdaho told
The Daily Beast The US government should have moved more quickly to list
them as a terrorist organization and brought US resources to track and
disrupt their activities The failure to act swiftly has had consequences

Johnnie Carson who served as assistant secretary of state
for African affairs from 2009 to 2013 said that putting the extremist group on
the terrorist list would have helped in their recruitment

There was a concern that putting Boko Haram on the foreign
terrorist list would in fact raise its profile give it greater publicity give
it greater credibility help in its recruitment and also probably drive more
assistance in its direction he told The Daily Beast adding that the Nigerian
government was against such a move by the US

Secretary of State John Kerry added Boko Haram to the
terrorist list in November 2013

The April 15 abduction has generated outrage around the
globe and calls for Nigeria to liberate the girls before they can be sold into
slavery or harmed Nigerias police have said more than 300 girls were abducted
from their secondary school in the countrys remote northeast Of that number
276 remained in captivity and 53 managed to escape

The terrorist groups leader Abubakar Shekau threatened to
sell the girls during a grainy video released this week

The Pentagon said it was sending fewer than 10 troops to
Nigeria as part of the US effort to help find the girls but had no plans to
launch a military operation The troops part of a larger US assistance team
that will include State Department and Justice Department personnel will help
with communications logistics and intelligence planning

Clinton a potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate
said the Nigerian government has been in my view somewhat derelict in its
responsibility toward protecting boys and girls men and women in northern
Nigeria in the last years They need to make it a priority to do everything
they can to try to bring these girls home safety







Report Clintons State Department Refused To List Group
That Kidnapped Nearly 300 Teen Girls Terrorists Part 2 of 2

Clinton took to Twitter on Sunday to urge their release
ending her message with the popular hashtag hashtag Bring Back Our Girls

At the conference Clinton also questioned the need for more
congressional oversight into the deadly attack on the diplomatic post in
Benghazi Libya The Republicanled House is expected to establish a select
committee to investigate the Obama administrations response to the attack that
killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans on Sept 11 2012

Clinton said there were a lot of reasons why some people
involved in the investigations choose not to be satisfied

I do not believe there is any reason for it to continue in
this way but they get to call the shots in the Congress she said

Republicans have accused the White House of misleading the
nation in the heart of President Barack Obamas reelection campaign by playing
down intelligence suggesting Benghazi was a major al Qaedalinked terrorist
attack Democrats have said the investigations are politically motivated and
aimed at hurting congressional Democrats in the fall midterm elections and
damaging a Clinton presidential campaign if she decides to seek the White House
again

House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa RCalif
issued a subpoena against Secretary of State John Kerry to testify later this
month about Benghazi Kerry said that he will cooperate with the subpoena and
that he has nothing to hide

Roberts relayed a question from an audience member on
whether Clinton  if she runs for president  would consider Sen Elizabeth
Warren DMass a favorite of liberals or San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro
the keynote speaker at the 2012 Democratic National Convention as potential
running mates

Clinton called both extraordinary leaders and great
political advocates  I admire both of them greatly Asked if she might be the
first woman to crack the glass ceiling of the presidency the former first lady
demurred

Well I think we should crack it also I am 100 percent in
favor of that Clinton said But I have nothing further to say about my path
right now

      The Fugitive Slave Act Of 1850 amp
Obamas Lies

 
That Act voted for by Democrats declared that all runaway slaves were
upon capture to be returned to their masters Abolitionist nicknamed it the
bloodhound law for the dogs that were used to track down runaway
slaves This law passed and was in fact
highly


Fact Checking Obamas statement on 92613 You had a state representative somewhere say that
its as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave
Act Think about that Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets
slaveowners get their runaway slaves back I mean these are quotes Im not
making this stuff up OBAMA LIED the
guy did not say it was WORSE than that act

THE ACTUAL STATEMENT BY
OBRIEN What is Obamacare Mr
OBrien said his remarks It is a law as destructive to personal and
individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 that allowed slave owners
to come to New Hampshire
and seize African Americans and use the federal courts to take them back to
federal  to slave states
OBAMACARE IS HIGHLY DAMAGING TO INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND PERSONAL LIBERTY
BECAUSE LIKE THAT ACT OF 1850 THAT TOOK FREE MEN AND FORCED OTHER FREE MEN TO
SHIP THEM BACK TO THE DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED SOUTH OBAMACARE FORCES PEOPLE TO BUY
HEALTH INSURANCE CONFISCATING THEIR MONEY AND DOUBLES DOWN BY FORCING THEM TO
SUBSIDIZE THE HEALTHCARE OF ALL AMERICANS
BOTH PIECES OF LEGISLATION ARE CONFISCATORY AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THEIR
AIMS AND BOTH ARE A POISON ON OUR BODY POLITIC AND IN OUR SOCIETY THE GOVERNMENT REPEALED THE FUGITIVE SLAVE
ACT OF 1850 AFTER ABOUT 4 YEARS OVER THE PROTESTS OF DEMOCRATS LETS HOPE WE

      CHURCH OF THE STATE HILLARY WANTS
TO REWRITE RELIGION TO MAKE IT MORE ABORTIONFRIENDLY

Far too many women are denied access to
reproductive health care and safe childbirth All the laws weve passed dont
count for much if theyre not enforced Hillary Clinton said at the Women in
the World Summit on Thursday night Rights have to exist in practice not just
on paper Laws have to be backed up with
resources and political will And deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs
and structural biases have to be changed



Clinton made it emphatically clear
shes not just talking about say the horrific abuse of women by Islamist
extremists As I have said and as I believe the advancement of the full
participation of women and girls in every aspect of their societies is the
great unfinished business of the 21st century and not just for women but for
everyone and not just in far away countries but right here in the United
States She pointed at the very ground she was standing upon to emphasize the
point







As an aside that has to be one of
the strangest clunkiest rhetorical devices Ive ever heard As I have said
and as I believe Granted with politicians in general and Clintons in
particular a disclaimer that what theyre saying really is what they believe
is often necessary but theres no particular reason to believe such a
disclaimer when Hillary Clinton delivers it
If she really believed everything she was saying at this Women in the
World Summit why was she happy to rake in millions of dollars from countries
that treat women horribly



Quibbles about odd rhetorical
devices aside this vow to use government force to rewrite religious belief and
make it more contraception and abortionfriendly is deeply offensive and par
for the course with true believers in the Church of the State as both Barack
Obama and Hillary Clinton are Clinton has been at it much longer Back in the
Nineties she was high on the notion of the collectivist State as a spiritual
vehicle  the politics of meaning as the catch phrase went



The difference is that Obama will
occasionally use Christian symbolism and Scripture to advance his political
agenda as when he insists that charity can only be properly administered by
the State and Christians are therefore obliged to support high taxes massive
government spending and regulatory power Obama is also big on using Saul
Alinskys Rules for Radicals against Christians as when he tried to shame
them out of criticizing his foreign policy by pontificating about the Crusades



Clinton on the other hand more
explicitly views politics as absorbing religion as in this example Her Church
of the State has made certain decrees concerning mandatory payment for other
peoples contraceptives and unrestricted abortion any organized religion that
resists must be forcibly rewritten to accept these judgments



Unlike Obama Hillary isnt much
interested in pretending to be a devout Christian In this speech shes
creating a continuum between Taliban savages murdering girls for daring to go
to school and American Christians who dont want to pay for other peoples
abortifacient drugs Genital mutilation
opposition to lateterm abortion its all the same to her Religions must be
reprogrammed until theyre fully compatible with the latest version of
radicalfeminist code



Thats one of the worst problems
with the bizarre cult so much of modern feminism has degenerated into they
ignore vast amounts of real suffering in the most fearsome corners of the world
to focus on using their notion of womens rights as a cudgel against domestic
political opponents Clinton does mention some of those global horrors facing
women but mostly because she wants to roll them into an identitypolitics scam
that mixes a grab bag of collectivist political ideas into the very definition
of womanhood If you disagree with anything in that grab bag youre
antiwoman



Of course voting for female
Democrat candidates  most emphatically including Hillary Rodham Clinton  is
an essential component of this politically engineered feminist identity Asking questions about Hillarys deleted
emails or shady finances occupies a slightly different point on the same
continuum as sexual slavery The worst parts of that continuum lie in parts of
the world where weak liberal culture has decided aggressive criticism of the
deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases is
politically incorrect or where the diminished American prestige brought about
by the foreign policy of Obama and Clinton has left America with very little
influence Rest assured you will not see the likes of Hillary Clinton rewriting
the deepseated cultural codes of Dearborn mosques When Boko Haram marched
hundreds of girls into slavery liberal feminisms response was a Twitter
hashtag



Clinton offers a compelling case
as if more evidence was needed that her and Obamas brand of coercive
liberalism is utterly incompatible with American ideals of religious freedom
Shes rather directly stating that almighty government leaves very little room
for individual conscience Were supposed to have a government that serves the
people and reflects their values instead the Left worships a State powerful
enough to change the people hammering square citizens into round holes of
ideology



Well have to rewrite our
traditions and religious beliefs to comport with your vision Mrs Clinton I
think well have to take a pass on your vision then Just in case you actually
gain power is there any chance we can keep our traditions by making generous
donations to the Clinton Foundation



Shortly after her rewriting
religion remarks Clinton declared that eliminating the sexual wage gap of
leftwing mythology would generate zillions of dollars in enhanced national wealth
Since almost all of that wage gap is due to women choosing different career
paths than men what shes actually calling for is frogmarching women into
dangerous jobs with long hours and little accommodation for motherhood
requiring degrees in subjects theyd rather not study This would require vast
amounts of coercive force stamping out the hopes and dreams of girls who
prefer to set different courses in life including fulltime motherhood Tell
me whos declaring war on women again

      8 things we learned from the Clinton emails

By SARAH WESTWOOD SARAHCWESTWOOD  52315 209 PM

The highly selective trove of Hillary Clinton emails
released by the State Department Friday revealed both the seemingly strong
influence Sidney Blumenthal wielded over the secretary of state and the
preoccupation with media coverage exhibited by her closest aides



If the 296 published emails are to be considered a complete
collection they would suggest Clinton relied almost exclusively on an aide
that had been banned from the State Department Blumenthal to provide her
intelligence on a country at war



The emails show that Clintons staffers often circulated and
debated press clippings amongst themselves and occasionally discussed how to
respond to certain media criticisms



They also provide a narrow glimpse of how the State
Departments top ranks operated in the weeks before and after the greatest
crisis of Clintons tenure





Clinton asked State Dept aides to prepare speech for
Clinton Foundation

An email dated Sept 22 2012 shows Clinton appeared to
discuss a speech for the Clinton Global Initiative less than two weeks after
the Benghazi attack



Jake Sullivan a top Clinton aide sent Clinton a draft of
the speech that day and encouraged her to let me know your
thoughts



The entire speech is redacted under a FOIA exemption that
allows agencies to hold back internal deliberations



What is unclear is why Clinton was using State Department
aides to prepare a speech for her familys foundation or why the text of that
draft would be considered an internal government communication



The day of Benghazi attacks Clinton asked for a film
she made a cameo in

Hours before the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi
Clinton asked a pair of her top staffers to find her a copy of the Bernard
Henri Levy documentary The Oath of Tobruk



Levy had directed the film about the Libyan war which
featured a cameo from Clinton herself



But elsewhere in the emails Levys name surfaced again
although it was redacted in the version released by the State Department



In a memo to Clinton dated March 27 2011 Blumenthal noted
that French President Nicolas Sarkozy had asked Levy a sociologist to use his
long established ties to Israel Syria and other nations in the Middle
East to assess the level of influence al Qaeda and other terrorist groups
wielded in the Libyan government



This will be exciting when its FOIAd

A lighthearted exchange between Philippe Reines Thomas
Nides and Caroline Adler  all top Clinton aides  revealed the staffers had
FOIA in mind when emailing with their government accounts



Describing an interview Clinton gave to Wall Street Journal
reporter Monica Langley in which the reporter sat too close to the secretary
Reines said he didnt think you see that behavior among any type of
mammal





Was like the dental hygienist rolling around the floor
to get the best access to your mouth depending on what tooth she was trying to
get access to he wrote



I may go and throw up since I am laughing so
hard Nides said



Adler who was copied on the chain added this will
be exciting when its FOIAd



Clinton confused names of slain Americans

In the hours after Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other
Americans were murdered in a terrorist raid Clinton sought advice from her
aides about when to announce Stevens death



But critics quickly pounced on the fact that Clinton
seemingly jumbled the ambassadors name with that of Sean Smith a foreign service
information management officer who was also killed in the attack by referring
to the slain diplomat as Chris Smith instead of Chris Stevens



Blumenthal and Clinton had secret meeting just after
Benghazi attack

Clinton appears to have visited Blumenthal just weeks after
the Benghazi attack



Blumenthal told his old friend it was great to see
you on October 6 2012 and encouraged her to drop in again
the emails show



A day later he invited Bill and Hillary Clinton to his home
after the election



Postelection wed like to have you over for
dinner Blumenthal wrote Bill can come too if hes in town
Whatever works



Will do she replied



The exchange was yet another illustration of the close ties
between the former Clinton aide and secretary of state that has sparked
controversy in recent days



Emails between Blumenthal and Clinton made up a significant
portion of the records released Friday



In 9 months leading up to Benghazi theres only 35
Clinton emails

The State Department emails span most of Clintons final two
years in office but the cache contains long stretches of time when either no
emails were sent or none were disclosed



In the two weeks before the Benghazi attack Clinton and her
staff either did not send each other a single email regarding the atmosphere in
Benghazi that led to the death of four Americans in a raid on the US
consulate there or the emails during that time were not disclosed



In the nine months of 2012 before the Sept 11 attack
Clinton and her aides exchanged just 35 emails that the secretary of state
evidently deemed fit to give the State Department



Private server emails contained sensitive data FBI
classified just hours before release

The FBI classified information in one of Clintons emails
just hours before their release the Associated Press reported Friday



State Department officials told the AP Clintons emails from
Nov 18 2012 contained the names of suspects that had been arrested in Libya
in connection with the attacks



Twentythree words were redacted from that particular email
published on the State Department website



Reporters pressed State Department spokesperson Marie Harf
on why information sensitive enough to be considered classified even retroactively
was handled on a private server



Its possible that the degree of sensitivity  evolved
over time Harf said at a briefing Friday



State Dept made political helpful redactions

Leaked emails published by the New York Times just one day
before the State Department officially released the email trove show that the
agency redacted a number of passages before publishing the documents



The State Department had redacted parts of emails that
revealed officials personal opinions about prominent Libyans



The agency also removed some of Clintons own words such as
her suggestion to explore arming the Libyan rebels using private security
experts



Clintons attempt to warn the White House to prepare for
Republican attacks on the Obama campaign using Benghazi as fodder was also
redacted although it is unclear how that information would affect national
security

      Hillarys Sniperless Bosnia AdventureHillary Clintons story about landing in Bosnia under sniper fire running to the car
with her and Chelseas
heads down and a canceled greeting rang as very inspirational and possibly
Presidential Too bad Sinbad and others on the trip began to speak out
and claim it was all a farce Hillary and her daughter discounted their
stories and insisted it was true We have documented news footage that it
wasnt true  The truth is that Hillary and Chelsea strolled off the
plane were met by greeters on the tarmac remained there to hear a little
girls sing and then posed for photo opportunities with nary a sniper to worry
about When the footage surfaced she called her repeated
statements a misstatement  When troops are
being shot at and dying over seas she makes false statements about imagined
moments under fire Iguess that says it all  I guess 12
years ago and the lies she told now says everything you need to know about her
character She was not only too inexperienced for Secretary of State she
has proven to be an embarrassment as well The Fact that the media lets here get away with this and
remains gushingly in love with Hillary is a sick joke and a sad commentary on

      Knowing What We Know Now Mrs Clinton Would You Still
Support Sanctuary Cities

By Mark Krikorian July 6 2015

In the wake of the murder of Kate Steinle by a
fivetimesdeported illegalalien felon news organizations worthy of the name
would be all over the Democratic candidates asking if they regret their past
repeated emphatic support for sanctuary cities After all every Republican
was asked about the Confederate battle flag which had nothing whatever to do
with the Charleston murders And yet San Franciscos refusal to turn over
illegal aliens for the feds until theyve been convicted of violent felonies
and the Obama administrations support for and even promotion of such
policies is the only reason this poor woman was killed





Heck even the Republicans havent jumped on this  other
than Trump whose widely mocked warnings of this very danger have been
vindicated This was the perfect opportunity for Walker or Rubio or Cruz Jeb
is hopeless of course to steal some of Trumps thunder by offering a sober
but scathing critique of the ObamaClinton policy of dismantling our
immigrationenforcement infrastructure  but so far its crickets And this
despite the fact that deporting illegalalien criminals is probably a 95
percent issue among Republican primary voters and a 75 percent issue among
voters in general This incident simply reinforces the Evil PartyStupid Party
narrative



Just last month the Senate Judiciary Committee received a
report that in just four years 121 illegal aliens who had been released by ICE
went on to murder Americans This spring the new director of ICE actually
asked Congress for legislation cracking down on sanctuary cities but within
hours was forced by the White House to recant



This isnt even the first time this has happened in San
Francisco in 2008 a gang member who was shielded by the citys sanctuary
policies murdered an American father and his two sons Near Sacramento last
year a previously deported illegal alien who had repeatedly come in contact with
police murdered two sheriffs deputies At least in this instance Republicans
in Congress have responded with immigrationenforcement legislation though it
hasnt yet been passed by either house Also in 2008 high school football
star Jamiel Shaw was murdered by a DREAMer a day after Los Angeles released the
illegal alien rather than turning him over to ICE after serving four months
for assault with a deadly weapon and battery on a police officer The
Remembrance Project documents those murdered by illegal aliens



These outrages underline the reason comprehensive
immigration reform has repeatedly failed despite massive amounts of
money and despite backing by all the commanding heights of the economy and
society No one believes supporters of amnesty and increased immigration will
enforce tomorrows laws any better than they do todays Kate Steinles
pointless tragic death is yet more evidence of our rulers utter indifference
to immigration law

RiceGoal was never to keep Iran from getting a slush fund to
spend on terrorismNational Security Advisor Susan Rice said that when international
inspectors take a peek at Irans nuclear facilities there wont be an American
in the bunchThere are not going to independent American inspectors separate
from the International Atomic Energy Agency Rice told CNN The IAEA will
be doing inspections  the inspections on behalf of the United States and the
rest of the international communityRice called the blowback over the deals inspectionsapproval
board  on which Iran holds a seat and will be able to appeal decisions 
misplaced concernWhat were talking about is the rare case when we have a
suspicious site or other suspicious entity that we or other members of the
international community believe needs to be inspected In that case the IAEA
will go to Iran and say we need to look at this And if the Iranians say no
there will be a process for working out that access to the IAEAs satisfaction
she saidIf that does not occur then the United States acting with its
European partners can together decide that that inspection must occur And if
it hasnt occurred by the end of 24 days Iran will be in violation of the
agreement and we would be in a position to go straight to the UN Security
Council and automatically unilaterally by the United States reimpose
sanctions So were not concerned that that length of time gives the Iranians
the ability to hide nefarious nuclear activityAsked about Iran using its sanctions relief slush fund to sink
money into international terrorism Rice said the deal was about the nuclear
program onlyThe UN resolutions that set up this structure always envisioned
that if an when Iran met its obligations and we could be confident that they
were not engaged in illegal construction or preparations for a nuclear weapon
that all the sanctions would be lifted Thats what the  thats what we all
signed up to she saidWhat do we think theyll spend that money on We think for the
most part theyre going to need to spend it on the Iranian nuclear program and
their economy which has tankedBut she added we should expect that some portion of that money
would go to the Iranian military and could potentially be used for the kinds of
bad behavior that we have seen in the region up until nowBut the goal here was never  and it was not designed to prevent
them from engaging in bad behavior in the region Theyre doing that todayPressed on what happens if Congress shoots down a deal with
vetoproof majority Rice insisted its hardly important what it means to the
presidents legacyIf this deal is going to fail let it be because the Iranian
government didnt implement its obligations And if thats the case were in a
strengthened position We can maintain the sanctions regime and we will have
the international community behind us for whatever else we may need to do she
saidBut if we jettison a deal that is a good deal that accomplishes
everything we set out to accomplish then its on us And Iran is unconstrained
and the sanctions regime and international unity is destroyed That makes no
senseBridgett Johnson 71615pjmediacomtatler20150716ricegoalwasnevertokeepiranfromgettingslushfundtospendonterrorismSmokedsalmoned comment  If you are dealing with a terrorist
nation trying to prevent them from building a nuclear bomb a nation whos
weapons have helped kill more americans than any other nation since 911 according
to our own National Security department why wouldnt preventing them from using
the funds you are about to give them from going to terrorist activities be one of your goals

      Bill Clinton Does Jim Crow

Democrats play the race card over voter ID
laws

August 3 2011

The last time Bill
Clinton tried to play the race card it blew up his wifes primary campaign in
South Carolina Well the Voice is back this time portraying the nationwide
movement to pass voter ID laws as the return of Jim Crow

There has never
been in my lifetime since we got rid of the poll tax and all the other Jim
Crow burdens on voting the determined effort to limit the franchise that we
see today the former President warned a student group last month

Mr Clinton is talking
about states like Kansas Wisconsin Alabama South Carolina Tennessee Texas
and the notoriously Confederate state of Rhode Island that have instituted or
tightened voter laws this year

These states are trying
to reduce the incidence of voter fraud which if not epidemic is hardly unknown
in America The liberal group Acorns widespread voterregistration fraud in
recent years drew national attention to the problem and criminal actions The
2008 Minnesota Senatorial race where a legal challenge over the validity of
absentee ballots decided the outcome by 312 votes was another warning sign
Kansas received 221 reports of voter fraud between 1997 and 2010 according to
a recent oped by Secretary of State Kris Kobach

Voter ID laws cant fix
every problem but they are a start As the Heritage Foundations Hans von
Spakovsky points out these laws prevent voters from impersonating someone
else make it harder for a person to vote at multiple locations and block
illegal aliens from voting Some states like Kansas are also reforming
votingregistration laws and absenteeballot rules to ensure uptodate voter
rolls

Mr Clinton claims
Republicans are trying to make the 2012 electorate look more like the
2010 electorate than the 2008 electorate presumably by reducing
Democratic turnout But Democratic voters have no harder time getting a
drivers license than do Republicans

The federal courts have
repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of voter ID laws In 2008 John Paul
Stevensno conservativewrote for a sixvote Supreme Court majority that voter
ID laws dont constitute an undue burden on citizens attempting to vote States
typically let voters cast a provisional ballot if they cant prove citizenship
on polling day and they provide IDs for free if needed

No wonder voters of
every age race and income consistently support these reforms A Rasmussen poll
in June showed 75 of likely voters favor voter ID laws as did 63 of Democrats
In Rhode Island where Democrats control both state legislative houses a
Democratic speaker cosponsored the new voter ID law I think that party
leaders have tried to make this a Republican versus Democrat issue state
Rep Jon Brien told the Pew Center on the Statess Stateline news service
Its not Its simply a good government issue

None of that is
deterring Democrats from using voter ID to drum up racial fears Democratic
Party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz used the Jim Crow line
earlier this year adding photo ID laws we think are very similar to
a poll tax Democratic Senators and House members have asked the Justice
Department to take action Look for this to be a consistent Democratic theme as
the election approaches amid party fears that declining real incomes will
dampen enthusiasm about reelecting President Obama

Perhaps these naysayers could take a
page from one of the Rhode Island laws supporters Democratic state senator
and cosponsor Harold Metts who told a local newspaper Im all for
party loyalty but God gave me a brain and I use it

      Virginia
Roberts sex slave Bill Clintons Lolita Express and the Dalai Lama saves
Prince Andrew

by Anorak 
15th February 2015 



The story of
Prince Andrew and Virginia Roberts the womn who claims she had sex with him
him when she was Jeffrey Epsteins underage sex slave has slipped down the
news cycle



Randy Andy
seems to have brushed the scare off Indeed the London Gazette says Andrew
will be made a viceadmiral in the Royal Navy when he turns 55 next week And
no thats not a pun



Over in the
Daily Mail one of Andrews former lovers Koo Starkers Stark is speaking in
his defence The Americanborn actress was
26 when she dated the Duke of York after his return from the Falklands
War in 1982 They dated er for 18 months The Duke married Sarah Ferguson in
1986 She says



I know too
much about the media and the law courts to allow the disgrace of an innocent
man That is why I have decided to reveal some details of my relationship with
Andrew My view is clear I believe him to be a good man and I believe I can
help rebut with authority the allegations against him Prince Andrew is a
dear friend and godfather to my daughter Ive only known him to be honourable
and honest with Christian values I
couldnt shrug off Virginia Roberts assassination of his character any more
than he has been able to He was being accused of the very worst kind of
behaviour The stain on his reputation
is spilling across his life like blood from a new wound



It all adds up to nothing much at all But on
she goes breaking 32 years of silence to tell all



my experience
of being with Andrew on our first date in Bewicks informed me of the effect he
has on any gathering be it a restaurant a club or a Royal court Conversation drops Body language changes
There is a bow wave of deference But Ms Roberts will have us believe this
extraordinary hour in Prince Andrews life passed unchronicled



Well yeah Do
we know everything he does And in any case men of money power cannot be
abusers





Then as now
he was very attractive to women What need would he have for any women to be
supplied for forced sex

The Prince of
course denies any wongdoing But in case that is not enough Stark digs deep 
very very deep  and tells us

To be publicly
and falsely labelled as guilty of sexual misconduct is as wrong as flogging a
woman for the crime of being raped It
is fortuitous that I have had the spiritual guidance of his Holiness the Dalai
Lama since 1990 Without it I doubt I would have had the courage to speak out
now



Case closed
Send the man up

Can Bill
Clinton employ the DL defence

Just a few
weeks ago reports broke that Bill Clinton had flown at least 11 times on The
Lolita Express  a private plane owned by the mysterious financier and convicted
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein According to Virginia Roberts who claims to have
been one of Epsteins many teenaged sex slaves Clinton also visited Epsteins
private Caribbean retreat known as Orgy Island



I remember
asking Jeffrey Whats Bill Clinton doing here  Roberts said in 2011 The
former president she added was accompanied by four young girls during his
stay  two of whom were among Epsteins regular sex partners And Jeffrey
laughed it off and said Well he owes me a favor He never told me what
favors they were



Clinton also
spent years traveling and partying with Ron Burkle a billionaire bachelor with
a penchant for very young girls Clinton spent so much time on Burkles private
plane that it came to be known in Burkles circle as Air Fk One



Its not going
to go away with Clinton invoilved allegedly

      This is typical of the way women in power communicate They deflect and blame themselves and apologize when none is needed A man would blame his staff for any issues with the schedule or the revisions even if it was really on him A woman goes out of her way to not be too demanding or call out of her staff member for screwing up the schedule How sad that HRC felt the need to do this as Secretary of State
