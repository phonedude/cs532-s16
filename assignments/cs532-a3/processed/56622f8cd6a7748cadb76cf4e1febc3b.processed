Today the Super Bowl is an entertainment and sports juggernaut But 50 years ago it was a different game In fact it wasnrsquot even called the Super Bowl at the time





















On Jan 15 1967 the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs faced off in the first ever AFLndashNFL World Championship Game in LA The Packers represented the National Football League and the Chiefs represented the American Football League a younger league that would merge with the NFL by 1970 The game is now called the first Super Bowl






Life photographers Art Rickerby and Bill Ray were among those covering the event but due to space restrictions most of their photos never made it in the magazine Thanks to Getty Images theyrsquove reemerged from the Life Picture Collection as a special look at this historic game

On Sunday night hundreds of photographers editors and technicians will provide virtually instantaneous coverage of the big game at Levirsquos Stadium in Santa Clara California Getty photographers for example will shoot up to 12 frames per second and get them online in three minutes But in 1967 the photography corps was much smaller and its capabilities much more limited They were restricted to shooting between one and three frames per second and they would spend days developing and processing their film Color photos were more expensive and harder to process then so most sports photographers shot in black and white






There were perks to photographing football in the old days of course Back then according to Getty Imagesrsquo director of sports photography Travis Lindquist photographers had better access to the teams Ray for one was allowed in the Chiefsrsquo locker room during the game and had unrestricted access to the field that day Since the Chiefs lost however his photos werenrsquot published Now they serve as a rare time capsule from a distinct age in the history of the sport






ldquoI love the intimacy of this collectionnbspSeeing these guys in the locker room during pregame and interacting so naturally is something wersquod never be allowed to shoot now Seeing Chiefs coach Hank Stram on the bench the players messing aroundmdashthe access is so restricted now yoursquod never be able to shoot that againrdquonbsp
