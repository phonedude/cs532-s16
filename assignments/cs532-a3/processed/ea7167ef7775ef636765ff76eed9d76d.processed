Hey listen its cool When it comes to the Super Bowl you dont have to pretend to be interested in the game itself anymore Admit it you settle in for the commercials and when the game comes back on thats when you take your bathroom break
Thats become a standard response for viewing the Super Bowl I just watch for the commercials And networks and advertisers know this of course which is why the cost to advertisers is around 45 million per 30 second spot
Still we dont have to foot any of those bills and if your teams not in it why not just sit back and enjoy some of the years best advertising efforts And over the years there have been some incredibly memorable ads from the epic Orwellian Apple short to the Budweiser frogs to Betty White getting clobbered in a pickup football game
To prepare for another year of hopefully memorable commercials heres a primer of the 50 best Super Bowl commercials of all time
