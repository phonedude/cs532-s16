              Calling a dish Texas Chili especially if youre not a native of that state is clearly asking for trouble But this recipe of mine refined over years of potlucks and Super Bowl parties is too good to keep under wraps any longer Its depth of flavor comes from using so many different chile types  fresh green jalapeos earthysweet whole dried anchos pure pasilla for heat even mild tangy canned green chiles  and makes this recipe stand out It also has whole spices unsweetened chocolate and dark beer that meld seamlessly into a brickred sauce that naps the succulent meat Those two perfect elements are all you taste The meat can be cut into large chunks or  more traditionally  thin slices especially if you are using a tougher cut than chuck Sirloin also makes good chili If you have masa harina the corn flour used to make tortillas that will make the gravy even thicker but it is not necessary Like many vigorously spiced dishes this one tastes even better a day or two after it is made and will hold its flavor well for at least a week
