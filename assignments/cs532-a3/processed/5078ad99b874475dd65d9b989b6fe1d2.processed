field after a hard tackle by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC championship game in 1976 Associated Press     By George F Will Opinion writer February 5  Follow georgewill     Settling unhappily into his Super Bowl seat Himalayan high behind the end zone Joe spots an empty seat low and on the 50yard line He descends to it and asks the man seated next to him why the wonderful seat is unoccupied The man says Its mine I was supposed to come with my wife but she died This is the first Super Bowl since 1967 we have not attended together Joe says But couldnt you find a friend or relative to come with you today The man replies No theyre all at the funeral This story from Heidegger and a Hippo Walk Through Those Pearly Gates Using Philosophy and Jokes to Explore Life Death the Afterlife and Everything in Between by Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein prepares you for gathering around the national campfire that is the annual Super Bowl telecast Super Bowls are so august they are usually denoted with Roman numerals This years however is designated Super Bowl 50 because Super Bowl L looks weird It should be called the 50th or Lth Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Bowl  George F Will writes a twiceweekly column on politics and domestic and foreign affairs He began his column with The Post in 1974 and he received the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1977 He is also a contributor to FOX News daytime and primetime programming View Archive   Facebook RSS   Last week the New York Times reported that after Ken Stabler died of colon cancer in July at 69 his brain was sent as he had directed to scientists in Massachusetts His mind according to his daughter was definitely in a pretty quick downward spiral The scientists determined that Stabler the Oakland Raiders quarterback in Super Bowl XI 1977 who played 15 seasons in the NFL had on a scale of 1 to 4 high Stage 3 CTE a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated blows to the head including blows not severe enough to produce immediate symptoms of concussion Stabler probably will be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame making him the eighth member among the more than 100 former players known to have had CTE  Quarterbacks are somewhat protected by their offensive line and by NFL rules from footballs worst violence But the Times also reported that Earl Morrall the quarterback who helped the Miami Dolphins get to Super BowlVII 1973 had Stage 4 CTE when he died in 2014 at 79 And last month Jim McMahon 56 another 15season NFL quarterback said he considers medicinal marijuana a godsend as he copes with headaches and difficulties associated with his diagnosis of earlyonset dementia He played for the victorious Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX 1986  How many deceased players had and how many former players have or how many current players will have CTE is unknown because it can be confirmed only by autopsy Its symptoms however are similar to those of dementia  Footballs kinetic energy is increasing as the players become bigger and even the biggest become faster In 1980 only three NFL players weighed 300 or more pounds This season 354 did including seven 350pounders  Sundays game will be 60 minutes of football  an adrenalineandtestosterone bath stretched by commercial breaks two of them called twominute warnings replay challenges and other delays to about 200 minutes  embedded in an allday broadcast of manufactured frenzy It would be nice but probably fanciful to think that even 1 percent of the expected television audience of more than 110 million will have qualms about the ethics of their enjoyment  The NFLs fondness for Roman numerals is appropriate because the game is gladiatorial as Romans enjoyed entertainment featuring people maiming and being maimed for the entertainment of spectators But things change  Capital punishment was not considered among the cruel and unusual punishments in 1791 when the Eighth Amendment was ratified every state used the death penalty and the Fifth Amendment assumes its existence In 1958 the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society Our society would emphatically say the Eighth Amendment forbids earcropping branding and the pillory punishments used in 1791  Standards evolve concerning amusements too Someday boxing might seem as repugnant as bearbaiting and cockfighting now do Or maybe not given the growing popularity of mixed martial arts cage fighting which is degenerative prizefighting The phrase evolving standards is synonymous with improving standards  Are todays parents who put crash helmets on tykes before they put the tykes on tricycles going to allow these children to play football Not likely This game will be different or much less popular  or perhaps both  when in 2066 the national campfire is lit for Super Bowl C  Read more from George F Wills archive or follow him on Facebook
