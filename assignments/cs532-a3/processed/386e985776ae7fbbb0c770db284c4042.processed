Perhaps the most persistent myth during this election cycle is that the amount of government experience of Hillary Clinton far exceeds that of Bernie Sanders I think thishas been able to gain as much traction as it has due to the fact that Mrs Clinton has simply been in the national consciousness far longer than Senator Sanders has But the facts speak for themselves

Bernie Sanders served as Mayor of Burlington Vermont from 1981 to1989 a period of 8years He was then elected to the House of Representatives in 1991 where he remained until 2007 at which timehe was elected to the US Senate Sanders was reelected to the Senate in 2012 and has continued to serve in that capacity to the present day By my accountingthat is 32years in actual elective office

Hillary Clinton on the other hand has justsix yearsas a US Senator to show forexperienceas a duly elected representativeand her tenure as Secretary of State lastedfive years from 20092013 it may just seem longer

So in terms of what is generally referred to as public service Hillary Clinton can only claim 11 years experience as compared to Bernie Sanders 32 a difference of 21 years or about onethirdthe amount of time

Even if we add into the mix the various posts she held during her husbands 8year presidency none of which she was elected to orneeded confirmation in order to occupy the grand total comes to19 years which is still 13 years less than Senator Sanders During the 12 years Bill Clintonwas Governor of Arkansas Hillary workedas a fullpartner in a law firm But if we do so wed probably be obliged to include Senator Sanders teaching of political science at HarvardsKennedy School of Government in 1989 and at Hamilton College in 1991

In all fairness which onehas the most actual experience
