		It8217s expected that 115 MILLION Americans will tune in to watch tonight8217s Superb Owl game between the Carowlina Panthers and the Denver Broncowls
The Superb Owl is the culmination of the American Footbowl season and tonight marks the fiftieth year of the annual event
Bookmakers have made the Broncowls almost 21 underdogs despite having the most dominant defense in the sport However Carowlina only lost one game all season and are led by the always explosive Cam Nowlton
But not everyone tunes into the Superb Owl to watch the game There will be a host of firstrun advertisements that people go inexplicably wild over The halftime show will feature a set of songs from Owl City for the seventh year in a row and Puff Daddy will make a guest appearance singing his hit song Owl Be Missing You
But it8217s not just Americans who watch the Superb Owl at least three Englishmen are expected to be watching tonight This is up from last years total of two and is great news for the NFowL who are hoping to move a franchise to London by 2022
It8217s not all good news though The World Health Organization are warning that millions of views could suffer from SBI Super Bowel Inflammation SBI is caused by sitting around for long stretches of time drinking beer and eating junk food
Fans don8217t seem to give a hoot about the health warning though as the Superb Owl is all about excess much like owl puns
