Coldplay upon us its time to go to the videotape and determine with scientific accuracy which past halftime were very good and who was very bad For the record Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were Very Bland and the Who were Very OldWe dont count performances before the modern era which began with 1991s nod to New Kids on the Block Previous to their performance the Super Bowl halftime show featured a lot of marching bands and performances from Up With People who may have done a wonderful job in 1982 with their Salute to the 1960s and Motown or in 1986 with their Beat of the Future but I dont want to encourage those kinds of choices in the future Especially when many legends are still potentially semiliving We need Tina Turner not Up With Peoples Tribute to Sexually Ambiguous Rockers of the 1970sLets all be grateful that there wont be any more tributes to the Big Band Era now that its fans are either dead or in places where theyre not in control of the TV remote Laugh all you want but it comes to us allLets get to the best5 2002 Super Bowl XXXVI New Orleans U2 Only Bruce Springsteen couldve handled running the halftime celebration post911 with as much diplomacy and success But Springsteens music is best when its joyful whereas U2s works best when its tapping into the serenity of the soul In this context with the names of the fallen scrolling on a screen behind them Bono and Co made Beautiful Day sound like a promise to be kept I say this as a complete nonfan who doesnt care much for their solemnity but here it was necessary4 1996 Super Bowl XXX Tempe Arizona Diana RossDiana Rosss medley of soul hits  Stop In the Name of Love You Keep Me Hangin On Baby Love Aint No Mountain High Enough I Will Survive sorry Gloria Gaynor  was a solid selection of tunesnbspeveryone knows but it was her decision to leave the stage via helicopter that made it a night to remember3 1993 Super Bowl XXVII Pasadena California Michael JacksonThis is where the modern era truly starts Sure New Kids on the Block provided a current name in 1991 and Gloria Estefan was more culturally relevant than Carol Channing in 1992 but Michael Jackson was the Worlds Biggest Musical Star and his halftime performance increased TV ratings so substantially that the Super Bowl Honchos running the show decided to ride the pyrotechnical wave we currently enjoy where people stick around for the show Not sure We Are the World or the childrens choir was a good idea but Billie Jean was worth it2 2005 Super Bowl XXXIX Jacksonville Florida Paul McCartneyAfter the wardrobe malfunction of the previous yearnbspThe Super Bowl Committee for Wardrobe Malfunctionless Performancesnbspsaw to it that they hired a performer who would keep his clothes on Preferably someone older and safer and without breasts to bare Sure enough BeatlesWingsreservist Paul McCartney stuck to the music and while I wouldve chosen four different tunes the fact that Macca has too many songs to choose from says he deserved the job He did get to sing about California grass but at this point it refers to the lawn in a boomer retirement village1 2007 Super Bowl XLI Miami Gardens Florida Prince Florida AampM University Marching 100 BandHow Princes people coordinated with Mother Nature Inc to have it rain during Purple Rain will certainly be a fascinating chapter in Princes eventual TellAll autobiography due in 2032 but for now we just have video proof that Prince went beyond what a halftime performer is contracted to do He came He played He conquered That even people who hate him on principle not me had to admit he was good tells you something He wasnbspverynbspgoodWatch HereRelated 7 Super Bowl Halftime Performers That Time ForgotsuperbowllistsReblogShareTweetPin itSend
