Assignment #2
Due: 11:59pm 2016-02-11

1.  Write a Python program that extracts 1000 unique links from
Twitter.  You might want to take a look at:

http://thomassileo.com/blog/2013/01/25/using-twitter-rest-api-v1-dot-1-with-python/

But there are many other similar resources available on the web.  Note
that only Twitter API 1.1 is currently available; version 1 code will
no longer work.

Also note that you need to verify that the final target URI (i.e., the
one that responds with a 200) is unique.  You could have many different
shortened URIs for www.cnn.com (t.co, bit.ly, goo.gl, etc.).

You might want to use the search feature to find URIs, or you can
pull them from the feed of someone famous (e.g., Tim O'Reilly).

Hold on to this collection -- we'll use it later throughout the semester.

2.  Download the TimeMaps for each of the target URIs.  We'll use the ODU 
Memento Aggregator, so for example:

URI-R = http://www.cs.odu.edu/

URI-T = http://mementoproxy.cs.odu.edu/aggr/timemap/link/1/http://www.cs.odu.edu/

Create a histogram* of URIs vs. number of Mementos (as computed from
the TimeMaps).  For example, 100 URIs with 0 Mementos, 300 URIs
with 1 Memento, 400 URIs with 2 Mementos, etc.

* = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram

3.  Estimate the age of each of the 1000 URIs using the "Carbon Date" tool:

Note: you'll should download the library and run it locally; don't
try to use the web service.

For URIs that have > 0 Mementos and an estimated creation date,
create a graph with age (in days) on one axis and number of mementos
on the other.  

Not all URIs will have Mementos, and not all URIs will have an estimated
creation date.  State how many fall into either categories.
