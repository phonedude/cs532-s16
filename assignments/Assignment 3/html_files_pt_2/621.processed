   Bernadette the Yellow Boxfish

   Eat or be eaten is the law.

   It’s a hard life for us under the waves, weather you are
   planktonic, crawling, sliding, rolling, swimming, buried motionless—we
   all try to do one thing well, and that’s eat.

   We all try to do one thing better, and that’s avoid being eaten.

   I am a hypocrite. I cannot stand the thought of some big fish with a
   huge mouth grabbing me head first and sliding me alive down their
   throat to be digested, yet at the same time I have no problems biting a
   happy go lucky (not so lucky today) shrimp in half. But that’s the law
   of the reef for you.

   Now I belong to a family of fish that are strange indeed, we are not
   fast, nope can’t outswim you, in fact were positively slow. We cannot
   bury ourselves, we cannot hide in-between small rocks or corals to
   avoid you. We live mostly solitary lives or indeed in low numbers so we
   have no protection in large shoals. We are not camouflaged, indeed
   mostly the opposite, we stand out like a sore thumb, you look at 100
   fish and who stands out like a lighthouse with a neon sign flashing
   “Here I am! Eat me!” above our heads.

   So, who am I and why am I still here? Please allow me to introduce
   myself…

   I am Bernadette the sweet, lovely yellow boxfish.

   Our little darling babies are the cutest thing you have ever seen, they
   melt even the stoniest hearts, but I pack a dark secret under my
   skin. It takes millions of years to evolve, and in doing so we have a
   wonderful defense mechanism, one that really puts the predator off for
   life, that’s if it lives, and to be quite honest we are quite proud of
   our evolutionary trick.

   Now, I am not going to tell you if we produce our defense
   with specialized cells under our skin or indeed if it is produced by a
   bacteria living in our skin, that’s for you to find out. So what is it?
   Well a nasty little chemical called pahutoxin and it packs quite a
   punch and quickly, well it has to or a bite will kill us.

   So let me tell you of a tale. I was swimming by a nice head of brain
   coral when from behind came the jaws of a stone fish, within a second I
   was inside and stressed to hell. This stress triggered a fantastic
   chain reaction and in milliseconds my toxin was released. Now it’s
   a surfactant which means it’s fast moving in water and disrupts fats,
   oh what are cell membranes made of – lipids! So water moves through a
   fish 100% of it flows over the gills, so within 3 milliseconds a toxin
   laden fluid was bathing the breathing apparatus of the predator. But I
   am only a small fish and the gills of this beast are huge, so it’s a
   good job pahutoxin is lethal in extremely low concentrations 10 parts
   per million to be exact, putting it into a human concept knock back a
   Sambuca but then spit it out into an Olympic swimming pool that’s the
   dilution factor.

   So what does pahutoxin do? It’s what you call a hemolytic agent, heam –
   blood, lysis – split so it splits the blood, in fact it destroys blood
   cells that carry oxygen into the body of our predator. My chemical just
   sits in the gills and with a biological hammer destroys every blood
   cell that passes by. Before the stone fish had chance to bite down on
   my fantastic body it was spitting me out and in a terrible state
   jerking and shuddering until it simply died of oxygen starvation. Did
   it bother me? No, it’s the law of life on the reef.

   Oh no—here comes James. He’s a nice guy, full of himself, but I don’t
   like the way he displays his spots to me, believe you me I can do much
   better, so off I pop, slowly of course, and if we meet just admire my
   beauty, and above all don’t disturb me!
