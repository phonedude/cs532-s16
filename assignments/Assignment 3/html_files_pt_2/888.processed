   Chess is mental torture.
   Garry Kasparov

   On Feb. 10, 1996, a computer won a game of chess against a world
   champion for the first time.

   The computer was Deep Blue, a machine designed by IBM capable of
   computing 100 million positions per second.

   The champion was 32-year-old Russian Grandmaster Garry Kasparov, who
   had first been named world champion at age 22.

   The game was the first in a match of six held in Philadelphia. Kasparov
   rebounded in the following five games, fighting the computer to two
   draws and three victories, winning the overall match.

   Kasparov took the first move of the first game, and defeated the
   improved Deep Blue in 45 moves.

   However, Kasparov was unable to understand the reason for one of the
   computer’s final counterintuitive moves, which may have been the result
   of a software glitch. He interpreted it as a sign of an intelligence
   superior to his own, and became anxious and unnerved.
