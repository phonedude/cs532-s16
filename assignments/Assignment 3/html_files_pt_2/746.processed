   world’s most recognized companies become, and remain, market leaders.
   From emerging enterprises to large public corporations, our clients are

   Fenwick & West was founded in 1972 in the heart of Silicon
   Valley—before “Silicon Valley” existed—by four visionary lawyers who
   left a top-tier New York law firm to pursue their shared belief that
   technology would revolutionize the business world and to pioneer the
   legal work for those technological innovations. In order to be most
   effective, they decided they needed to move to a location close to
   primary research and technology development. These four attorneys
   opened their first office in downtown Palo Alto, and Fenwick became one
   of the first technology law firms in the world.  [17]MORE >

   From our founding in 1972, Fenwick has been committed to promoting
   diversity and inclusion both within our firm and throughout the legal
   profession. For almost four decades, the firm has actively promoted an

   towards improving our diversity efforts at every level.  [18]MORE >

   profession. Many of our attorneys are recognized as leaders in their

   Property Practice Groups consistently receive top national and

The Terms Behind Unicorn Valuations

   As of December 31, 2015

   By: Barry J. Kramer, Khang Tran and Nicole Harper

   February 10, 2016
     * [146]The Terms Behind Unicorn Valuations

   Publication Profile

Background

   In May 2015, we published our first survey of the terms of unicorn
   financings. That survey covered financings undertaken by US based
   unicorns in the 12 month period ended March 31, 2015, and is available
   at [147]www.fenwick.com/unicornsurvey.

   This is our second unicorn survey and it covers financings undertaken
   by US based unicorns during the 9 month period ended December 31, 2015.
   We believe that it covers virtually all such unicorn financings that
   occurred during the period.

   The purpose of this survey is to provide information on the current
   terms of unicorn financings, and to identify trends in changes in those
   terms over time. For information on how the valuations and terms of
   late stage financings affect subsequent IPOs, see our recent survey at
   [148]www.fenwick.com/termseffectsurvey.

Overview of Results

   The highlights of the results of our survey are as follows:
     * At a high level, the results of this survey are similar to the
       results of our prior survey. The main difference is that the number
       of unicorn financings increased in the current period, despite the
       current survey covering a shorter period of time than the prior
       survey.
     * However, upon further analysis, the beginning of the period covered
       by the survey was markedly stronger than the end of the period
       covered by the survey.
     * This difference was especially noticeable in the fourth quarter,
       which saw a significant decline in the number of financings and
       valuations, and a significant increase in the use of more investor
       friendly terms such as senior liquidation preferences, IPO
       protection terms and upside benefits.
     * An interesting aspect of the fourth quarter financings is that half
       of the financings had valuations in the $1.0-1.1 billion range.
       This could signal that companies were trying to attain a unicorn
       valuation, and may have been willing to be more flexible on other
       terms to attain that valuation. If so, this could have contributed
       to the more investor friendly terms in the fourth quarter.
     * For the survey as a whole, the use of IPO protection terms that
       provided investors not only with downside protection, but also a
       premium on the unicorn price, increased compared to our prior
       survey. The average premium was 60% of the unicorn price.
     * The per share price for the unicorn financings covered by this
       survey was, on average, 57 times higher than the per share price of
       such company’s Series A financing. This multiple is obviously very
       large, and could result in early stage investors having different
       views of a company’s preferred liquidity time frame and strategic
       path than later stage investors.
     * As with our prior survey, investors in the financings covered by
       this survey continued to receive more “downside” protection for
       acquisitions than for IPOs. This could result in investors in
       unicorns whose value subsequently declines receiving returns that
       will vary significantly depending on whether the company chooses an
       acquisition or IPO as its liquidity path. This could also cause
       early and late stage investors to have different views of a
       company’s preferred strategic path.
     * The percentage of unicorn financings led by non-venture capital
       investors such as mutual funds and hedge funds increased to 84%
       during the period covered by the survey, and investors on average
       acquired 9% of the company in the unicorn financing.

Survey Results

   The detailed results of our survey are as follows:

   Financing Overview

     * We note that breaking out data by quarter, as we have done in this
     survey, results in a more limited sample size for each individual
     quarter, but we felt that it was valuable to do so to see the trends
     over the course of the survey period.
     ** A blank line indicates that we did not collect this information
     in the prior survey.


   Valuation Analysis


   Price Change


     * One company had a nearly 1700% up round in 4Q15. If this financing
     was excluded, the average per share percentage price increase from
     the prior financing round for 4Q15 would have been 121%.


   Downside Protections — Acquisition Protection Terms



   Downside Protections — IPO Protection Terms


     * A “blocking right” means that the unicorn investors’ preferred
     stock will not automatically convert into common stock on an IPO
     unless the IPO price is at least as high as the previously agreed
     price. As the conversion of all preferred stock into common stock is
     almost always required for an IPO, if the agreed price is not met
     the company and investors will need to resolve the issue. This can
     result in the issuance of additional shares to the unicorn investors
     as consideration for the investors agreeing to convert their shares
     of preferred stock into common stock.

   Upside Benefits



   Super Voting Stock



Concluding Thought

   Although this report focuses on the rights provided to investors in
   unicorn financings, it is important to understand that these rights are
   not permanent or unchangeable. Rather, investors can lose these rights
   in certain circumstances, most notably as part of future financings in
   which investors who do not participate in the financing can be deprived
   of previously granted rights (“pay to play financings”). The use of pay
   to play financings increases during downturns in the venture
   environment, when it is more difficult for companies to raise capital
   and companies look for ways to encourage investment. And even if
   investors have sufficient voting rights or financial ability to protect
   their rights in pay to play financings, companies in need of additional
   funds might find it necessary to provide new investors liquidation or
   other rights superior to their unicorn (and other) investors to attract
   needed capital. This happened frequently when the dotcom bubble burst
   in the early 2000s. Although the use of structures that reduce or
   eliminate outstanding investor rights is uncommon during most of the
   venture cycle, they become more common during significant downturns in
   the venture economy.​​​​
