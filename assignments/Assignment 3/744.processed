       Athens-Limestone Hospital to assist medical staff with a patient
       who was becoming out of control at the emergency room the morning
       of Feb. 3. Officials did not release the patient's name, however

       mother that it would be necessary to use the taser. One officer
       used the device on the patient while the other struggled to
       restrain and handcuff the patient. Medical staff assisted, and the
