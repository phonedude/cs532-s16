Review

   Practical Empathy is a straightforward guide to extracting greater ROI
   from the squishiness of empathy. --Harry Max, VP Product AllClear ID
   Practical Empathy will convince designers and product managers how and
   why empathy is a key ingredient to both product innovation and
   organizational success. --Sam Ladner, author of Practical Ethnography
   Customer Experience is now a key competitive differentiator; however,
   to truly stand out, organizations need to have and apply empathy for
   their customers. This wonderfully insightful book teaches us why
   empathy is important, how to gain it, and how to apply it within our
   businesses. --Richard Dalton, AVP Experience Design, USAA

About the Author

   For the past 20 years, Indi Young has been pioneering ways to
   understand customers and employees in order to support them better.
   Most organizations have developed awareness and expertise at gathering

   These same organizations, however, are inexpert at understanding why.
   The messy and divergent reasoning and motivations that drive people s
   decisions are what Indi helps you tune in. She is expert at gathering
   the thoughts that lie deeper than simple preferences, opinions, and
   desires. And she is expert at helping you solidify patterns and sort
   through the wavelengths to focus on particular channels so you can

   founders of the user experience agency Adaptive Path, which has
   provided leadership for the experience and strategy design field.
   During her career, Indi has worked with clients in many industries,

   [107]5.0 out of 5 stars[108]Short, clear and helpful
   By [109]C. Jarrett on April 11, 2015
   Format: Paperback
   (This is my review from Amazon.co.uk)
   "Voice of the customer". "Understand user needs". "Get out of our
   silos". "No more group-think".
   It's no longer news that it's a good idea to understand, respect, and
   design for other people's perspectives. And there are plenty of books
   around on a plethora of specific techniques to help with that.
   (Disclosure: I'm writing one myself, on surveys).
   Indi Young's engaging little book takes a different approach. Her focus
   on 'empathy' gets away from the ability to share the feelings of others
   to focus on understanding those feelings in ways that help us to act on
   them.
   The chapter that I found most immediately useful was Chapter 4, 'A new
   way to listen'. She gets away from the language of 'the interview' - as
   she points out, a concept that may bring up uncomfortable resonances of
   job interviews, disciplinary interviews, and other stereotyped
   interactions. Instead, she proposes 'Listening sessions' - and explains
   exactly how to do them, in a way that's clear, practical, and allows
   for flexibility.
   That 'practical' note shines through the rest of the book - and
   definitely justifies its place in her title. You'll find solid advice
   here for learning about others - customers, clients, colleagues - and
   then using that understanding in our own designs, in our workplaces,
   and in developing an 'empathetic mindset' for everyday life.
   Early in the book, she's included this 'Frequently Asked Question':
   "How are you using the word "empathy?"
   And her answer is:
   "This book is not about the kind of empathy where you feel the same
   emotions as another person. It's about understanding how another person
   thinks--what's going on inside her head and heart.[110]Read more ›

   [115]5.0 out of 5 stars[116]Accurately Titled!
   By [117]Lacey Graves on March 9, 2015
   Format: Paperback
   As a user experience professional, my toolkit includes all kinds of
   methods for evaluating an experience. That being said, empathy is not a
   tool of evaluation! Empathy is a skill—a skill that can be learned—and
   this book will tell you how to do it. Young outlines how to *really*
   listen to people and gives practical techniques that will help you
   truly empathize with others. You do not have to be a researcher with a
   PHD or a Psychologist—this book will teach you how to truly walk in
   another person's shoes. This book compliments Mental Models (her
   previous book) and is an excellent next installment.

   [122]4.0 out of 5 stars[123]A good effort, but falls flat on making
   empathy actionable
   By [124]Dylan E Wilbanks on February 7, 2015
   Format: Kindle Edition
   I'm of two minds about this book. On the one hand, empathy is a hot --
   and needed -- topic in product design right now, and I have a great
   deal of interest in pushing it. On the other hand, I was disappointed
   that while Young lays out a good case for empathetic design, her
   suggested exercises are very abstract and don't seem grounded in a way
   to help those who will need help cultivating empathy that they're on
   the right track.
   I was also disappointed in her ideas for synthesizing the conversations
   into real feedback. Admittedly, understanding why people do the things
   they do isn't easy. But she's very either-or: Take notes or use your
   memory. I think there's room for both, and there are some other things
   you can borrow from other fields (like transcribing the conversation)
   that would help spring to mind things from the conversation you may
   miss.
   Young does a great job laying out the case for instilling empathy in
   your team for people who use your products and services. But the
   "practical" side falls short in my mind. Still, a good primer.

   [136]5.0 out of 5 stars[137]A must read for people who are inside
   organizations seeking to align competing interests.
   By [138]Poornima Vijayashanker on April 5, 2015
   Format: Paperback
   Indi does a great job of exposing the common misconceptions around
   empathy (understanding just to persuade). How these misconceptions have
   formed over time. And ultimately the effects of their application to
   organizations and products: silos where people feel like they are
   serving different constituencies.
   In this book, Indi digs into cognitive empathy: developing a deep
   understanding about another person. And that deep understanding can
   only come from practicing empathy, through listening sessions. Finally,
   Indi goes into how it will benefit your organization as it's serving
   customers and its employees.

   [143]5.0 out of 5 stars[144]Insightful, pragmatic and inspiring
   By [145]Donald M. Farmer on July 31, 2015
   Format: Paperback Verified Purchase
   As a long-time meditator and peace activist, I tend to be wary of the
   sudden recent "rediscovery" of empathy in design and business. Yet
   among all the shallow posturing, every now and then you come across a
   writer or designer who really does understand what is needed. Indi
   Young is one of those who has thought deeply about empathy and its role
   in collaboration and design. Her book is titled perfectly - this is
   above all a guide to applied, empirical empathy in our work.
   And it does take work. The words practice, teaching, learning,
   repeating all stand out. I really like that Practical Empathy is both
   aspirational ("It feels different to be a true listener,") and
   realistic ("You are not expected to embrace everything written here
   wholesale. Instead, incorporate bits and pieces into your regular work
   practice.")
   What you practically learn here is how to listen in a new way to the
   needs of users - and the techniques for doing so are neither obvious or
   easy. And building on that listening, how to structure what you hear
   into patterns of behaviour that you can, in turn, use as the basis of
   design decisions.
   I recommend the book - and the accompanying website - without
   hesitation. And if you are fortunate enough, do take the opportunity to
   study the techniques first hand with Indi. I did so recently in Seattle
   and it was an outstanding day of learning.
