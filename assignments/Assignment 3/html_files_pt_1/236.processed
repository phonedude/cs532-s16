     The Concord School Committee has voted to bring a new math
     curriculum to the town’s three elementary schools, beginning next
     year.

     The unanimous vote on Feb. 9 brings a curriculum called “Everyday
     Math 4” to the schools. It was recommended by a math committee of
     curriculum specialists and teachers -- including math department
     chairs at Concord Middle School and Concord-Carlisle High School --
     that worked for 18 months before making its recommendation.

     “This is huge,” Kristen Herbert, Concord Public Schools director of
     teaching and learning, told the school committee, “because it will
     change an entire year of curriculum for K-5 students.”

     Some elementary school teachers participated in two rounds of pilots
     to test the program, and 72 percent of the teachers who submitted
     survey responses support it.

     Teachers will receive training materials in the spring so they can
     study over the summer, and letters will go out to parents informing
     them of the change.

     Before the vote, School Committee Chairman Wally Johnston said some
     people were concerned about the “spiral” nature of the curriculum.

     Herbert told Johnston that the spiral aspect is an advantage,
     because it brings back concepts learned in previous lessons and
     grades into current lesson plans, which keeps past material fresh in
     the minds of students.

     Herbert said Everyday Math 4 is a proven commodity that has existed
     for more than 20 years, and it’s more challenging for students
     because it’s aligned with the federal Common Core standards.

     She also said more challenging course work is something that parents
     said they wanted for their children, based on last year’s parent
     surveys.

     Several teachers who participated on the math committee told the
     school committee that Everyday Math 4 will meet the needs of a broad
     range of students, from the top achievers to those with a wide range
     of learning styles.
