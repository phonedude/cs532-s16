   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- [123]Carolina Panthers quarterback [124]Cam Newton
   admitted he's a "sore loser'' in defending how he handled himself with
   the media after Sunday's loss to Denver in Super Bowl 50.

    [130]Transcript of Cam Newton's postgame comments
       Cam Newton was visibly upset when talking to the media after the
       Super Bowl. Here's what he said.

   The newly crowned league MVP walked out on reporters after answering
   only a handful of questions, mostly with short answers, following the
   24-10 loss. He did so while wearing the hood of a black hoodie pulled
   over his head.

   "I've been on record to say I'm a sore loser,'' Newton said Tuesday as
   players cleaned out their lockers. "Who likes to lose? You show me a
   good loser and I'm going to show you a loser. It's not a popularity
   contest. I'm here to win football games.''

   Newton said if he offended anyone, "that's cool."

   He added: "But I know who I am and I'm not about to conform nor bend
   for anybody's expectations because your or anybody else's expectations
   will never exceed mine."

   Newton hasn't spoken to the media in his previous four seasons on exit
   day, but he felt compelled to talk Tuesday amid the criticism. He said
   there were no regrets about how he handled himself after the loss.

   "It happened,'' he said. "I didn't want to talk to the media at the
   time. The truth of the matter is I really still don't want to talk to
   the media. But at the end of the day, things have to happen.

   "I had a lot of time to go back and play everything back. I'm human. I
   never once said that I was perfect. I never proclaimed that I was
   perfect, but at the end of the day, people pick and do things of that
   sort.''

   Carolina coach Ron Rivera said criticism of Newton was unfair. While he
   might have preferred Newton handle the postgame differently, he didn't
   ask his quarterback to speak to the media on Tuesday.

   Rivera commended Newton for that.

   "Obviously somebody had a great conversation with him and explained it
   to him and he was able to compose himself and speak to you folks,'' he
   said. "That's huge. What he did today was a part of his growth. He is
   still growing and maturing as a man in this world.''

   Asked why Newton is a target for criticism, Rivera said because people
   "don't know him.''

   "If you took the time to know who Cam Newton is, if you saw all the
   things that he did, there would be much more of an appreciation for who
   he is as a person,'' Rivera said.

   "People draw something on a snapshot. Don't take a snapshot. Take the
   whole album. Take time to read the whole book. ... This is a young man
   that some people are looking at the cover and they're looking at it the
   wrong way.''

   General manager Dave Gettleman, in talking about Newton's postgame
   behavior, said one of the things he looks for in a player is somebody
   who "hates to lose.''

   "We all handle things differently,'' he said. "It's hard.''

   Several teammates gathered around Newton while he spoke and shouted "We
   love you!'' They also playfully sang: "Hurray for Cam! Hurray for Cam!
   Hurray for Cam, he's a horse's ass.''

   One of those was fullback [131]Mike Tolbert. He agreed with Rivera that
   criticism of Newton has been unfair.

   "He's a competitor just like everybody else,'' Tolbert said. "You look
   at the guy. He's not happy at all about what happened. I'm not happy
   about what happened. I don't think anybody that played in this game was
   happy about what happened.

   "So why should we be all smiles when the game is over?''

   Newton smiled at his teammates' support, but otherwise was defiant in
   his defense of himself. "The truth of the matter is, who are you to say
   your way is right?'' he said. "That's what I don't understand. We've
   got all these people condemning, and saying he shouldn't have done
   this, that and the third. What makes your way right?''

   Newton also was defiant in vowing the Panthers will return to the Super
   Bowl, reminding everyone they had only two losses all season, while
   some teams lost their first two games.

   "I've got no more tears to cry,'' Newton said. "At the end of the day,
   when you invest so much time and sacrifice so much and things don't go
   as planned, the emotions take over. That's what happens.

   "As far as trying to be like this person, trying to be like that person
   ... the truth of the matter is I'm not trying to be like this person.''

   Newton said the league is great with him or without him, and that he
   doesn't plan to change.

   "I said it since day one, I am who I am, I know what I'm capable of and
   I know where I'm going,'' Newton said. "I don't have to conform to
   anybody else's wants for me to do. I'm not that guy."

   Newton also defended himself for not diving to try to recover his
   fumble in the fourth quarter that eventually was recovered by the
   Broncos. Denver went on to score a touchdown to put the game out of
   reach. Newton said that he would have risked injury by diving, as it
   would have meant he would have had to twist his leg in an awkward
   direction.

   "I didn't get the fumble,'' Newton said. "We can play tit for tat. I've
   seen numerous quarterbacks throw interceptions, and the effort
   afterwards ... they don't go. I don't dive on one fumble, because of
   the way my leg was, it could have been [contorted] in a way.

   "We didn't lose that game because of that fumble. I can tell you
   that.''
