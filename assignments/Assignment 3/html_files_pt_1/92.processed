   A man who stole a perfume set just three days before Christmas has been
   given a suspended prison sentence.

   Neville John Muttock, 48, of Palmer Drive in Hythe, stole a fragrance
   gift box worth £35 from a shop in Sandgate Road on December 22 last
   year.

   Muttock pleaded guilty at Folkestone Magistrates' Court on February 1
   to shoplifting and was sentenced to 60 days in prison, suspended for 12
   months.

   He must also pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
