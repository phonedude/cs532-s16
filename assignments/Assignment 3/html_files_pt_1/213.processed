   Authorities say the mother of a 3-day-old [102]Ohio boy who died after
   he was bitten by a dog won't face any charges after a coroner ruled the
   death accidental.

   The (Youngstown) Vindicator (http://bit.ly/1PCh0DN) reports police
   Detective Sgt. David Sweeney says there was no evidence the mother
   intentionally tried to harm her child.

   The pathologist who performed the autopsy on the infant said the he
   died from four puncture wounds on the skull when a dog in the home
   tried to pick up him out of a clothes basket on the floor next to a
   couch where his mother was sleeping.

   Youngstown police say Kristy Grim called 911 Sunday after waking to
   find her child injured and crying. The infant died before paramedics
   arrived.

   The dog's fate was not immediately determined.
