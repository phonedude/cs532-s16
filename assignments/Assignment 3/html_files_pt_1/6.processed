   The Protein Science / Late Stage Downstream Processing (DSP) group, a
   core function that develops purification processes for late stage
   pre-clinical projects, is seeking motivated and experienced scientists
   to join our antibody discovery program at EMD Serono. Candidates will
   be primarily responsible for developing purification processes for a
   variety of therapeutic candidate proteins including monoclonal
   antibodies and Fc fusion proteins in support of projects in
   pre-clinical programs. Scope of work will include, but is not limited
   to, protein purification, biochemical and biophysical characterization
   of proteins, novel purification technologies, purification process
   development, data analysis and project reporting. Candidates should
   have experience in writing technical documents for process transfer to
   manufacturing. The candidate is expected to have excellent time
   management skills, with the ability to adapt to rapid changes in
   projects priorities and meeting aggressive timelines. These individuals
   should enjoy working in a team setting and be able to work well with
   research scientists, the manufacturing group as well as external
   collaborators.


   KEY TASKS & RESPONSIBILITIES:
     * Responsible for activities ranging from protein purification,
       filtration, biochemical and biophysical characterization of
       proteins:-
     * Execute routine protein purification with affinity, size exclusion,
       ion exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography using AKTA
       systems (Unicorn software)
     * Perform analyses including SDS-PAGE, SE-HPLC, LAL, host cell-DNA,
       host cell protein, as necessary
     * Provide expertise and insight to guide development of appropriate
       purification methods


     * Develop novel purification processes as well as using standard
       methods to purify proteins from the mg to gram scale. Processes
       will be multiple steps and must provide necessary clearance of
       viruses, endotoxin, and host cell proteins and DNA.
     * Perform, develop and optimize robust, efficient, scalable
       strategies for improving process performance. Activities will
       include small-scale studies and pilot scale purification studies.
     * Apply DOE methods to purification activities.
     * Candidates are expected to initiate and champion new technologies
     * Demonstrate ability to work effectively in teams, both within the
       group and cross-functionally
     * Scientists analyze and interpret data and present/document the
       results at meetings
     * Provide reports and prepare scientific presentations as needed.
       Write/revise ROPs and technical reports


   EDUCATION/LANGUAGES
     * MS/BS in biotechnology, biochemistry or engineering field.
     * BS with 5-10 years, or MS with 0-5 years of industrial experience
       is required for the position.
     * Fluent in written and spoken English


   PROFESSIONAL SKILLS & EXPERIENCE
     * Solid and proven theoretical basis and hands-on experience in
       protein purification and analytical characterization.
     * Hands-on experience with purification unit operations including
       filtration, chromatography, TFF, UF/DF, AKTA, UNICORN and HPLC
       systems.  Strong hands-on experience in troubleshooting and routine
       instrument maintenance.
     * Experienced in protein purification via affinity, hydrophobic
       interaction (HIC), ion exchange (IEX), size exclusion (SEC) and
       mixed-mode chromatography
     * Knowledge and skills in biochemical characterization of proteins
       including analytical and biophysical techniques.  Experience with
       protein formulation strategies is highly desirable.
     * Proven track record in Purification Process Development is
       necessary with emphasis on chromatographic separations and
       excellent understanding of and experience with chromatographic
       resin screening and process optimization.  Experience with scale-up
       and GMP manufacturing is desirable.
     * Working knowledge of DOE. Ability to critically analyze data using
       statistical tools and to compile technical reports
     * Strong interest in evaluating and developing new protein
       purification technologies is required.
     * Familiarity with mammalian, microbial and yeast protein expression
       is a plus.


   PERSONAL SKILLS & COMPETENCIES
     * The ideal candidates will be self-motivated, have excellent
       organization and communication skills, and be able to function in a
