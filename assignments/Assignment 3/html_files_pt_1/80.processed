New bill looks to save smartphone encryption from state bans

   Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) are introducing a
   bill today to effectively override bad state-level encryption bills.
   [193]The ENCRYPT Act of 2016, or by its longer name, the Ensuring
   National Constitutional Rights of Your Private Telecommunications Act,
   would preempt state and local government encryption laws. The two men
   said today they are "deeply concerned" that varying bills surrounding
   encryption would endanger the country as well as the competitiveness of
   American companies. The argument is that it wouldn’t be easy or even
   feasible to tailor phone encryption capabilities for specific states.

   The catalyst for the new bill [194]was the proposal of state-level
   bills in California and New York. Those proposals, which consisted of
   the exact same text, would ban smartphone encryption for phones sold in
   those states and fine manufacturers for each phone sold with secure
   disk encryption. While proposed by different state assemblymen — Jim
   Cooper in California and Matthew Titone in New York — they were both
   encouraged by local DA offices to bring the bills to their respective
   legislatures. Neither bill has made any forward movement and both have
   a long way to go before becoming law.

   "It wouldn’t be easy to tailor phone encryption capabilities for
   specific states"

   The ENCRYPT Act likely won’t be the only encryption bill Capitol Hill
   sees this year. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), along with Sen. Richard
   Burr (R-NC), [195]vowed to bring a bill imposing limits on encrypted
   devices to the Senate this year. But perhaps two other senators might
   beat them to the punch and [196]introduce a bill that would establish a
   national commission to study encryption. Regardless of what bills come
   first, it looks like [197]the encryption war isn’t ending any time
   soon. If anything, it’s only now heating up.
