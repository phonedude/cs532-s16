                        Position Title Resort Manager

    Company Introduction Destination Hotels (Destination) is a collection
   of luxury and upscale independent hotels, resorts and residences across
      the United States. Offering authentically-immersed and enriching
    experiences, each property is individual at heart, yet connected by a
   commitment to drawing upon the best of each location. Highly distinct,
    the Destination experience is always memorable and matchless; guests
   will feel the locale in a genuine way through each property and during
        the engaging moments cultivated both in and outside of them.

   indigenous spas, and 110 exceptional bars and restaurants. Destination
              Hotels are true to our place; diverse by design.
      Property Introduction A full-service, luxury resort in an idyllic
     mountain setting, Resort at Squaw Creek rests at the base of Squaw
     Valley USA, site of the 1960 winter Olympics, and just minutes from
     California's North Lake Tahoe. Having just completed a $53 million
     resort-wide renovation, this AAA Four-Diamond resort has never been
     more magnificent. Our dramatic lobby, through its floor-to-ceiling
    windows, overlooks a cascading waterfall and the breathtaking Sierra
    Nevada Mountains. Our 405 luxurious resort rooms and suites, complete
   with resort-style kitchens, fireplaces and LCD flat-screen TVs, comfort
   guests in mountain home ambiance. This is no ordinary Lake Tahoe hotel.
     Our gracious hospitality and full-service amenities led Conde Nast
    Traveler magazine to rank the Resort at Squaw Creek among the top 50
   ski resorts in North America. Recreation enthusiasts love the resort's
   true ski-in, ski-out lodging, 18-hole championship golf course, on-site
   cross-country ski center, fly fishing center, ice-skating rink, heated
