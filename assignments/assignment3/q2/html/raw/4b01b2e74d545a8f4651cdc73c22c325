  Google Analytics is web code we put on our web pages and google records the visits and  other statistical data that we can present to you. Google Analytics is a trusted source for these results and because its industry standard its easy to compare web site to web site. You can see for your self just how popular and successful Wikiwirral has become. <br />

                We don't charge them. If you can do your own art work pass it over and we can take it from there. Prepare your Advert in Word or Note Pad and we can take care of the rest. We may charge for customising images for you but that is all up front. Normally your requirements will be basic and then there would be no charge.
</p>
<p><strong>* Advert Changes</strong><br />
Normally no charge, in our experience advertisers only need a few tweaks now and then. If you require more help then we may charge, but with any charges there up front..</p>
