  <p><p>More and more people are now choosing to lease their cars. With the tightening of the lending criteria in the United Kingdom, less people will be able to get a car loan and in this day and age having more bills and loans to pay off doesn't seem too appealing.</p>
<p>What car leasing does is allow you to pay for your car on a monthly basis for a chosen fixed period of time. When the leasing period has ended the car must be returned to the dealer or if you want to; you will be given the chance to purchase the car for the remaining price left to pay on the car.</p>
<p>If this is an option you are considering, it's important for you to check your credit score. The lending criteria here isn't as tight as other loans', but it's essential to have a good credit score to be accepted.</p>
<p>The majority of dealers will require a deposit to be made on the car, especially if its a brand new and expensive car such as a Mercedes. This will usually be around 10 per cent however this can be higher or lower depending on your circumstances. It is advisory to save a little money prior to leasing in order to have a bigger deposit to put down, this is the best way to reduce the monthly payments on your car. Your other option is to defer your chosen amount of the payment until the end of the contract; this is only advised if you know you will be planning on purchasing your Mercedes Lease in the end.</p>
<p>Before agreeing to anything you must check what your financial agreement is. You need to ensure you have a cancellation policy in place; this should be clearly stated at the very beginning and put into writing. This should cover what position you will be in financially if you decide you need to leave the leasing contract early.</p>
<p>Once you've chosen your Mercedes, you have to discuss with the dealer exactly what is included in the Mercedes Leasing package. You must be able to include any servicing and maintenance allowance within the monthly payment, this way you know that you are covered just in case anything went wrong.</p>
<p>Overall Mercedes leasing is a great option for people, especially for those looking for a vehicle as soon as possible. The initial upfront deposit works alongside exactly what you can afford, so effectively you choose what it is you pay each month.</p></p>
