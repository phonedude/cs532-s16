Hodor? Nodor.
It seems Game of Thrones' Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and his beloved duo-syllabled protector Hodor (Kristian Nairn) will not be appearing in the show's fifth season.

Nairn mentioned his and Wright's season 5 hiatus in a recent interview with the Australian Broadcasting Commission.
"We have a season off and we have a year's hiatus, solely because I imagine our storyline is up to the end of the books," Nairn said.
By the end of the fourth season of the HBO show, Bran and Hodor have traveled north of The Wall to meet the Three-Eyed Raven.
HBO reps told Mashable they were unable to confirm the actors' hiatus.
Nairn says he will spend his time off from Hodoring by DJing and hosting his "Rave of Thrones" parties. (We suspect Bran will use that free time privately recovering from puberty.)
And let's all pray to the Seven Gods that George R.R. Martin takes no hiatuses from furiously writing — lest the sixth season of the show be just wide angle shots of the GoT sets.
