Led by the incredibly in-form Luis Suarez, Uruguay will be this summer's dark horse to bring the world's most prestigious and prized trophy back to South America. Boasting forwards such as the aforementioned Luis Suarez, Edinson Cavani and even veteran Diego Forlan, Uruguay are stacked in attack and will draw on their considerable tournament experience to compete. Having a rich history helps, as Los Charrúas have won the tournament twice in the past, once in 1930 and in 1950. However, their 4th place finish in the 2010 South Africa World Cup will be a point of pride that they look to this summer.
