Manchester United’s Reaction To Capitulation At Leicester City Will Determine The Squad’s Mettle

Posted on September 21, 2014September 21, 2014 by Peter Quinn

Let’s get this out of the way, Louis van Gaal’s new-look squad failed its first test in the pressure cooker that is the Barclays Premier League.
Yes, referee Mark Clattenburg had a ‘shocker’ and allowed Leicester City back into the match when he dismissed Jamie Vardey’s barge of Rafael da Silva, then awarded a penalty to the forward only seconds later.

And the match official perhaps missed a foul on Tyler Blackett in the buildup of play that led to the penalty before Leicester’s fifth and final goal.
But Manchester United capitulated during their 5-3 loss to Leicester City. Full stop.
The moment David Nugent’s penalty cut United’s lead to 3-2 and the King Power Stadium erupted, Louis van Gaal’s side should have pulled together and weathered the storm.
Anyone who has seen Nigel Pearson’s club play knew that Leicester City were never going to stop working for another goal and would be unrelenting in their efforts to take points from the twenty-time champions of England. It’s how they’ve been trained to play and has become a part of the club’s makeup.
But no one from United stepped up to pull the squad together and organize the players on the pitch.
In past seasons that responsibility feel to Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, who were also surrounded by a squad of players who had played a number of matches together in some of the most intimidating surroundings.
This United squad is brand new to these situations.
Yes, the club have brought in world class talents; who showed their abilities earlier in the match (Falcao assisted the opening goal, Di Maria scored one of the goals of the early season and Ander Herrera created a moment of magic with a flick of his feet).
But these players have now only played two matches together. United’s new additions have not had the luxury of a preseason to get to know each other; due to injuries and the timing of their transfers to the club. It is just a harsh reality that they need to learn about each other, and what to expect from other teams in the English top flight, on the fly. And the Barclays Premier League doesn’t offer up many easy matches.
The cynics are once again lining up to criticize Manchester United’s summer spending spree by saying the club spent too much money in attack, while ignoring the needs United faced in defence. And there is truth in that.
But Van Gaal and United could only buy the players who were available at the time. The club are in need of a commanding centre-back who can orchestrate the mix of young talent and new signings at the back of United’s formation.
Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels was not for sale and AS Roma defender Mehdi Benatia was destined for Bayern Munich (despite what Sky Sports News’ Jim White tweeted). There were other defensive targets, but they were just not on the market. The result is a United side that is heavy in attacking quality and slim in defence.
Regardless of how ‘poor’ United’s back-three or back-four are, they should not be conceding five goals to Leicester City. United fans can be sure that Louis van Gaal and his staff will make that clear this week.
Van Gaal’s post-match comments were direct and to the point: “You never expect that when you’re 3-1 ahead. You have to kill the game and keep possession.”
“We couldn’t do that.”
On the decision which led to Leicester’s first penalty, the Dutch boss directed his comments towards his right-back: “As a player [Rafael], you don’t have to do that and then you allow the referee to whistle.”
“We have to look at ourselves.”
Will the club concede another four or five goals in a match this season? It is possible.
Manchester United’s reaction next week against another well-organized, unrelenting Premier League club, West Ham United, will show the mettle of Louis van Gaal’s men.

Spot on Peter I still contend MUFC has no heart or soul. no Keane no Bruce no Neville. They are a higher quality QPR lots of names no grit. You don’t let Vidic go if you have no one to replace him. I know he was on the down hill but J Evans are you kidding and Smalling I would try to get anything in the next transfer market for him to timid not assertive enough.

Exactly. It’s not that good teams don’t have bad calls against them … it’s that they react well in spite of the bad call.

I’m not worried. LVG is still rebuilding. He’s done a fine job with attack and midfield. He just needs to work on defense over the next two transfer seasons.

Sorry, I don’t need to hear about he referee’s calls and non-calls. The almighty United certainly benefited from thees types of actions over he last few years.
I will say that to me it came down to the big money players against a team that had huge passion. Most of Leicester players played a very high spirited game and took advantage of what was handed to them
I am an Avid Arsenal fan, but I have to say that I do not think my team is going to do much this year. What I am focusing on is enjoying this high-spirited, energetic play that is taking place this year from the the lower and less money laden teams. Wow!!! What a season thus far. The big guys have a challenge this year and it’s not just the top 5 or 6 teams.

I don’t think the article blamed the loss on the bad calls. It said United reacted poorly to the circumstances and needs to improve.
Maybe have another read.

United need to stop talking about getting Ronaldo, Strootman, and other forwards and get a couple defenders.  Also, De Gea is poor quality and they should grab Krul.  United may become the most expensive team to ever fall in relegation.  Don’t laugh.  Look what has happened to them.  The worst is yet to come.

Yes we will be relegated for playing badly over the course of a 5 game season.
I seem to recall Arsenal getting hammered a few years ago by us 8-2 and getting torched routinely at the start of the 2011-2012 season and were behind Spurs by about 10 points in February/March yet come May they were ahead of Spurs.
But of course your sensible comment is correct because the league is Lost/Won in September.
My apologies for using common sense.

@jake u’ve just killed to da point! I also wonder why there is lots of rumours when man u loose and mostly to young teams as if it was an old log hard to fight with, instead of looking at it on diff perspective, as a fellow team like others and which can win too and loose like other teams do because it’s always a competition! Glory man united forever….

I disagree Peter based on the fact that had Clatternberg sent off De Laet for one of his numerous assaults on Di Maria they wouldn’t have had the chance to come back. Because of repeated De Laet challenges Di Maria ends up getting subbed out the game which was the plan by De Laet. Tis a shame he got to stay on the field but Di Maria gets taken out.
Ritchie had a numerous challenges worthy of a second yellow and the Referee basically let him hack all game long. They weren’t even niggling fouls but real challenges and clean outs.
He gets our best player taken out the game due to injury and we waste a sub as a result and for the Referee to give that as a penalty is a joke when Rafael didn’t even touch Varney who close lined him seconds before the incident. Complete joke.
Had we gotten those decisions the narrative would be “United buying referees and cheating poor old Leicester out of a win” but because United got the decisions against the narrative is now “United should overcome the Referees bad decisions because great teams do that”
For starters this isn’t a great team and the Referee being competent and doing his job results in a win.
This team has had a lack of bottle working against the grain since Fergie’s tenure. The Real Madrid game is the Poster Boy of this.

in the first place, their first goal was so controversial. If the ball had not crossed the line our becks wont have let go easily for that cramp ulloa, but again it was clattenburg vs verdy responsible. The fact that he kicked the ball before Rojo interceded doesnt mean the ball was in play, infact I can term it as carelessness of referee. About rafael and the same dude shouldnt be repeated since it was clear not genuine! My question is whether this guy mark clattenburg will keep earning his high salary doing such a recless job? I would suggest if he would be sucked and pressed some charges for the same, and before he gets away with it, be kainned some strokes on his back severally! Useless…

What should be clear by now is that Fergie was resting on his considerable laurels for the last few seasons of his tenure.  His players then got old or lost their way (ex. Nani) pretty much all at once.  It’s going to take more than one transfer season to rebuild United.  I also think LVG doesn’t yet appreciate how tough the Premier League is top to bottom.  There are very few gimmes on the schedule, unlike some other leagues in Europe.

Oh, and yes, Clattenburg had a huge effect on the game.  Jon Champion had it right when he called it “an eccentric performance” by the ref.

MU better get into form soon.  Their early schedule was pretty easy and they have failed against the teams that are not considered cream of the EPL.
