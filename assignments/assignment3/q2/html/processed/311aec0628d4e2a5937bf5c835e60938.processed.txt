Full Review                   Elisha Snipes  February 17, 2016                      Still Obsessed. I play this game all the time. I play the kross overs and but the gems and clothes. But it saddens me because I invest so much of my time and money in you and I can even get my kross over swag for playing your sisters game. Which is exactly the same as yours knly they focus more on social media. Listen I like the game but Im over the set back and glitches. Give me what i deserve; I played until level 8. Also cheapen the games clothing just a tad or at least give us the option to pay with gems and cash.
