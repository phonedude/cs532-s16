                            Bets are guaranteed to be fair because the seeds for the bet are known before you bet.
                        

                            The formula is
                        

Server Seed + Client Seed (->byte[4]) + Bet Number (->byte[4])
Double SHA2-512 hash the result
Keep taking groups of 3 bytes and converting to an integer, until a value less than 16 million is found.  If you run out of bytes, hash it again and start over.
Find the value's modulus of 1 million
The modulus is the bet result!


                            You are given the server seed's hash. Once the bet has been placed, the server seed is available, and you can verify the fairness of the bet. For automated bets, all bets are made using the same server seed.
                        

                            The current server seed hash is

                            Set the client seed manually
                        
Here is the actual SQL function this site uses (error handling stripped out)

create function dbo.CalculateBetResult
(
	@serverSeed binary(32),
	@clientSeed binary(8)
)
returns bigint
as
begin
	declare @hash binary(64)

	begin
		
		set @index = 1

This site pays 99.9%.  That's a house edge of only 0.1%.
It was inspired by others, and intended to be even simpler - as simple as possible!  Just betting.  That's it.
But their house edge is a full 1%, and ours is 0.1%.  That's not a statistical difference of 0.9%... it is a statistical difference of 900% (10 times closer to "perfect equality"!)
There are no commissions or fees (other than 's built-in transaction fee - there's no way to avoid that!).  Deposits do not require any confirmations before being credited to your account.  Most withdrawals are processed immediately.
This site is fully funded by private investors.  No further investments in the site are currently available.


The game is simple.
Select your bet size and your chance to win.  The potential profit for your bet will appear.
Then place your bet, either high or low.
A number between 0 and 999,999 is generated.  If the number falls within the high/low range you selected, you win.

Here is some sample html you can use in forum signatures to promote your personal referral link:

<a href='[link]' target='_blank'><span style='color:orangered'>999dice.com | 99.9% Dice Payout | Earn BTC/Doge/LTC with 50/50 Referral Program | Play &amp; Chat</span></a>

Do not spam other dice sites. You can put the link in a signature, or email and skype it to all your friends, but don't spam. This site is new, but there are lots of betters to go around. Do it legit.

Welcome!
This is a provably fair dice betting casino, funded by Bitcoins, Dogecoins & Litecoins.

                    The payout is
                    99.9%
                    .  The house edge is only 0.1%!
                
Thinking about the difference between other sites "low 1% edge" and our 0.1% edge?  It's not a statistical difference of 0.9%... it's a statistical difference of 900% (10 times closer to "perfect equality"!)
Deposits do not require any confirmations before being credited to your account.
You can also earn BTC by referring people to the site!  Check out the "Earn Referral BTC" tab for more info!

Chat
Welcome to the chat rooms.
This can be a dangerous place. Please read the rules and warnings before chatting.
Links

Do not post referral links. No advertising links.
Be careful if you visit links. You might think you are downloading a bot which is actually a virus.
Do not enter your 999dice password on any other website.
Do not use the same password on other websites as on 999dice. Some website owners try your password here, and if it works, they will steal from you.

Investments and Deals

Sending your coins to other people is risky. They might lose your money gambling, or they might steal it from you.
We do not get involved in investments or deals between users. If your money is not returned, there is nothing we can do for you. We might choose to ban someone if they are clearly a scammer, though.
Do not impersonate other users.
If you send coins to someone, make sure it's the right person. Check their account ID or identity and make sure it is an exact match. Some scammers try to impersonate other people.
Do not beg for coins. It is rude and annoying. You can already get coins to play with for free from this website.

Language

Speak the language of the chat room you are in.
Avoid fighting, swearing and accusations.

In general, we are trying to create a spam free, scam free environment which everyone can enjoy.
