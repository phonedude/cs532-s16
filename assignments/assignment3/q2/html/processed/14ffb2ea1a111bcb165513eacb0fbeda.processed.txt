Feb. 18, 2016 - POPE FRANCIS WARNED IN 2015 OF COMING APOCALYPSE
Pope Francis made some comments last year to Christians to prepare for the apocalypse, mentioning "cosmic cataclysms" and "the sun will be darkened", basically encouraging an STO response during this time.  It was not very specific other than that but noteworthy none the less.  Check out these articles http://yournewswire.com/pope-francis-tells-christians-prepare-for-the-apocalypse/  November 17, 2015. Commenting on Sunday’s Scripture readings, the Pope said that Jesus’ preaching about the end of the world contains “apocalyptic elements, like war, famine, and cosmic catastrophes.” “In those days,” Francis repeated, “the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.” [and from another] http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/15/paris-pope-francis-tells-christians-ready-end-world/  November 15, 2015. Two days after the horrendous jihadist attacks in Paris, Pope Francis preached about the “end times,” encouraging his hearers to be vigilant and ready at any moment to meet God face to face. [and from another] http://www.prophecy.news/2015-11-18-pope-francis-warns-about-the-end-of-world-in-wake-of-paris-attacks.html  “We are called to live the present,” Francis said, “but always ready to meet God whenever he may call.” The Pope also cautioned against unhealthy speculations about when the End Times will occur. Psychics and horoscopes distract us from what is important in the here and now, according to the Pope. After all, according to a widely referenced Bible verse, Mark 13:32, not even the son of Man knows when the End Times will happen. That is a piece of knowledge reserved for God the Father alone. [and from another]  November 29, 2014. http://www.ibtimes.co.in/pope-francis-says-apocalypse-inevitable-assures-better-earth-humanity-615553   The Christian leader said that the end of the world was inevitable because there was so much sin, adding that questions about the Apocalypse were ancient. The thought of the world "passing away" had travelled down through ages and though the Church knew no answers to when it shall happen, he confirmed that an end was unavoidable. The Pope also added that the apocalypse will not be the end; it will rather be a "transformation" to a new, more beautiful universe.

Pope Francis has been told about the approaching Planet X by Vatican astronomers. More revelations will be forthcoming from Pope Francis this year. He desires to warn the Earth's population even thought government and leaders will not.  In 2015 he referenced “cosmic catastrophe”, the Sun being darkened, the Moon likewise darkened. This is of course the time when the vast debris filled tail of Nibiru stands between the Earth and the Sun, during the Last Weeks. The reference to stars falling from the sky is the hour of the crustal shift, where all in the skies above will be in motion, and also debris in the tail of Nibiru plunging through the atmosphere, as bolides. 




Feb. 18, 2016 - CHINESE GOVERNMENT CONSTRUCTING HUGE RADIO TELESCOPE
The Chinese government is forcing 9,000 of its citizens to relocate so that construction can be finished on an enormous radio telescope that will be used to search for aliens. Once completed, the 1,640 foot diameter telescope will be the largest in the world and will boast the ability to search twice as much space as the famed Arecebo telescope.
Much like the SETI project, the Chinese 'supertelescope' will attempt to find radio signals emitted by extraterrestrials in space. Read more...



Feb. 18, 2016 - OBAMA IMPLIES WE'VE HAD INDIRECT CONTACT WITH ALIENS

The television show “The Ellen Show” has caught
the attention of UFO/alien enthusiasts as U.S. President Barack Obama guested
on the show and answered questions about aliens. It
wasn’t the first time the president responded to this kind of question, but
this time, a girl was the questioner. Obama responses, as in the past, are
characterized as bit humorous but at the same time don’t deny the issue,
leading to many speculations about the real meaning of them.
The little girl asks if aliens are real, and
Obama replies with another question “Well, what do you think?” She tells the
president that she believes they are real after seeing a TV program. Obama
throws some jokes and then replies: “The truth is we haven’t made direct
contact with aliens yet, but when we do I’ll let you know.”
Some speculate that if no direct contact yet,
there are already an indirect contact. Others say that the word “yet” implies
that the government knows direct contact will soon to happen.

UPDATE: Feb. 17, 2016 - TWO STRONG 6.0 EARTHQUAKES TODAY
A 6.0 magnitude earthquake shook 153km SE of Tobelo, Indonesia at 17:26.02 UTC and a 6.0 earthquake rocked the Southern East Pacific Rise at 23:48:35 UTC (blue dot on map). With this current geomagnetic solar storm hitting Earth, more 6.0 or higher earthquakes could be in the offing Earth is extremely active now. I still sense a mega thrust earthquake building in the South Pacific 8.0 or greater. The Masaya volcano (Nicaragua): is showing increasing lava lake activity




Feb. 17, 2016 - SECOND SHOOTER KILLED BOBBY KENNEDY

In late 1968 I was told by a CBS reporter who was at the Ambassador Hotel on June 5, 1968 with Senator Robert "Bobby" Kennedy, that Kennedy was shot by a second shooter. She witnessed it but was too frightened to come forward. Sirhan-Sirhan wasn't the only shooter. Betsey

Report by Jim Marrs: Paul Schrade, now 91 years old, was shot in the head on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles while standing alongside Kennedy. Schrade contends that Sirhan was not the only shooter that night. In an exclusive interview that aired Tuesday night, Schrade stated that Kennedy was actually killed by a second gunman.  Here is the full text of the statement he gave Wednesday to the parole board at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, where the now 71-year-old Sirhan is being held. Interestingly enough, against previous policy the media was kept out of the hearing. Apparently, there was something they didn’t want the public to know, Read more...


   

Feb.. 17, 2016 - 
Possible Cause for Microcephaly Outbreak​ May Not Be Zika Virus

The microcephaly outbreak in Brazil, which coincided with the spread of the Zika virus, continues to stun the world, even months after the incident was first reported. 

Pregnant women all over the world have been advised to take caution. The Zika virus infection has been linked to newborn babies with the birth defect microcephaly. This is a congenital condition in which babies are born with unusually tiny heads. 

The notion, however, has recently been challenged by a group of Argentine physicians. The group suspects that the Zika virus is not to blame for the rise in microcephaly cases, but that a toxic larvicide introduced into Brazil’s water supplies may be the real culprit. Read more...
 

Feb. 16, 2016 - BIG SHAKING IN CALIFORNIA 
A 3.5 magnitude earthquake shook Mammoth Lakes, California yesterday and today a 3.9 earthquake shook Big Bear City, California at 09:24:20 UTC, and a 4.8 shook off the coast of Michoacan, Mexico. I'm concerned because volcanoes worldwide seem to be showing increased activity, including the Mammoth Lakes, Calif. volcano.

Yesterday a 6.2 magnitude earthquake shook 219km NW of Auckland Island, New Zealand and a 5.3 in Krestena, Greece.  . 







Feb. 14, 2016 - IRISH CARPENTER TOLD WHEN WORLD WILL END BY ETS
A retired carpenter in Ireland claims that a stroll home from his neighborhood pub turned into an extraterrestrial encounter when he was abducted by aliens who told him when and how the world would end. Gerry Battles says that the incident occurred on December 26, 2001 as he was walking home from the Seven Sisters Pub. As he was admiring the stars, he noticed one particularly odd light emerge in the sky and then suddenly found himself aboard an alien spacecraft. 

While Battles story will likely be easily dismissed by skeptics, there is one quizzical element to it which should be of interest to UFO enthusiasts. The former carpenter had no recollection of his experience until a contractor from the Regional Hospital told him that they'd found his coat on the roof of the building! After getting his coat back, Battles suddenly remembered his incredible experience aboard the spacecraft.

Feb. 14, 2016 - NEW ZEALAND EARTHQUAKE CAUSES CLIFFS TO COLLAPSE


Cliffs have collapsed in New Zealand during an
earthquake in the city of Christchurch on the South Island. No serious damage
or fatalities were reported in the Valentine's Day quake that struck at 13:13
local time (00.13 GMT). Beaches to the east of Christchurch were busy with
swimmers and surfers when rocks began to fall into the sea. The 5.7 magnitude
quake occurred days before the anniversary of a deadly one in 2011. Click here for earthquake footage.





Feb. 14, 2016 - AFTERSHOCKS CONTINUE IN OKLAHOMA TODAY
The 5.1 earthquake recorded by the USGS in northwest Oklahoma last night was felt across Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, Nebraska, Texas, Arkansas, and Iowa. Although no one is saying it, I wonder if this is part of the New Madrid fault. The strongest after shock has been 3.9 in Waukomis, OK. According to records, the strongest earthquake on record to shake Oklahoma was a magnitude 5.6 centered in Prague, November of 2011. This earthquake has also increased earthquakes in Hawaii: a 2.7, and two 2.6 earthquakes hit Vocano, Hawaii, a 3.0 in Pahala, Hawaii, and a 3.0 in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. A 5.3 shook Tonga today and 2.6 and 2.9 in Bridgeport, California.  


Feb. 12, 2016 - STRONGEST EARTHQUAKE  SO FAR THIS YEAR HITS OKLAHOMA 
A 5.1 magnitude earthquake rocked 33km NW of Fairview, Oklahoma tonight at 17:07:05 UTC, the strong earthquake so far this year. Is it fracking or perhaps some other dynamics taking place in the center of the U.S.?  These earthquakes continue to grow in strength. The earth is being stretched in this region and will continue to have strong earthquake. Also, a 5.8 earthquake shook Christchurch, NY. 




The first photo looks like the number 1. Could these be messages from the Sky Beings?
Feb. 13, 2016 - PHOTOGRAPHER IN EASTERN IDAHO CONTINUES TO CAPTURE UFOS
Photographer Wayne Miller posted on Facebook yesterday: 


I am going out on a limb here to present what I think. And what I am in the process of confirming through the only outside source that I have ever heard mention anything about what I have been investigating for 4 years. And lately I have been posting on my GoinDark1 page as well as this one what I think these objects are. It is my belief that they are a form of protection placed in our skies thousands of years ago. To protect the planet against asteroid strikes. It makes sense to me, if you have been reading my posts about these objects from 2 days ago as well as on January 29 on my GoinDark1 page, I explain my views on these objects. And judging by the video's of the Asteroids falling and breaking up before they hit the ground, I'd say these objects are doing their job. I just want to go on record by saying that you didn't hear this from any of the superstars speaking on the Ufology circuit. They are not talking about it, because I don't think they know anything about it. I have known for sometime now that these are some kind of device, and not a life form. I just didn't know What or Why they are there. I am posting 2 pictures, one from a couple years ago and one from a couple days ago. Maybe you recognize them. Maybe I should name them.






Feb. 13, 2016 -  WHAT IS CAUSING THE POLAR VORTEX?
As I write these words, temperatures across half the U.S. are plummeting like a rock. Extreme lows are forecast by tonight: -32 degrees Fahrenheit in Fargo, N.D.; -21 degrees F in Madison, Wisc.; -15 degrees F in Chicago and Indianapolis, according to the National Weather Service. Wind chills will reach a bizarre 60 degrees below zero F in some places, freezing exposed skin within one minute. That number is more typical for Mars—at night, according to the Curiosity rover NASA has free-wheeling over there.
As each hour passes, more and more television and radio reporters are attributing the insane cold to a “polar vortex” up in northern Canada. Vortex, yes, but upper Canada? Not exactly. One forecaster called the beast a hurricane in the Arctic, which is dramatic but wrong. So what is this mysterious marvel and why is it invading America?

But why does the vortex weaken? Now it gets interesting. More and more Arctic sea ice is melting during summer months. The more ice that melts, the more the Arctic Ocean warms. The ocean radiates much of that excess heat back to the atmosphere in winter, which disrupts the polar vortex.  Read more...






Feb. 12, 2016 - SOLAR CYCLE LOWEST IN 200 YEARS, BUT WHY? 

It has been a couple of months since WUWT has checked in on the progress of solar cycle 24. Right now, the sun is in “cue ball” mode, with no large visible sunspots as seen below in the most recent Solar Dynamics Observatory. What is causing the sun to go quiet? There's really no answer, but some theorize that the presence of Planet X might be interfering with the sun as it travel through our solar system at this time.






Feb. 12, 2016 - POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE SHAKES INDONESIA
Have you notice all the 6.0 plus earthquake since the beginning of the year? Volcanos and earthquakes will increase as predicted. Today a 6.5 magnitude earthquake shook 3km ESE of Andekantor, Indonesia. A 5.0 earthquake shook Papua New Guinea. a 3.5 and 2.6 earthquake in Primo Tapia BC, Mexico (the Colima volcano is getting active in that region), a 2.9 in Puerto Rico and a 3.0 in St. Eustatuis and Saba in the Caribbean.  


Feb. 12, 2016 - EINSTEIN GOT IT RIGHT AGAIN

More than a billion years ago, in a galaxy far away, two black holes
surrendered to one another’s inexorable attraction and collided with such force
that it disturbed the very fabric of the universe. On Thursday, scientists
announced to the world that they had detected the ripple-like gravitational
waves that still course from this violent event and simultaneously confirmed a
prediction made by Albert Einstein a century ago. Read more...












Feb. 12, 2016 - ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS FROM CELL TOWERS CAUSE PAIN



If you’ve ever wondered if the thousands of cell phone towers and
electromagnetic signals permeating society nowadays could be potentially
harmful to your body, mind and to the natural environment, you’re not alone. A
small minority of people are so sensitive to electromagnetic radiation they’ve
even been forced to move into cave-like domiciles designed to insulate them from
such signals. We are, after all, energetic beings, as are all lifeforms, and
although something may lie outside of our ordinary perception does not
imply that it is harmless.
It turns out that electromagnetic signals from cell phone towers do in fact
directly affect the human body in physical ways, and surprisingly, for
amputees, common cellular signals can amplify sensations of pain in the body,
when in the presence of such emissions. Read more...



Feb. 12, 2016 - STRANGE FLIP FLOP WEATHER AS PREDICTED
I predicted at the beginning of 2016 the world would experience extreme cold in some regions of the world and warmer temperatures in other parts. Today an Arctic Blast is forecast to hit 20 U.S. States from the Midwest, South and East Coast and will affect 65 million people. The West and Southwest is experiencing warmer than usually temperatures. Part of Southern Idaho will have temperatures in the 60s by Monday, Feb. 15. Weather will continue to be extreme this year worldwide.




Penn State researcher Christelle Wauthier led a study to investigate ties between two natural disasters occurring eight months apart in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002: an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano (pictured), and a magnitude 6.2 earthquake

Feb. 11, 2016 - SCIENTISTS THEORIZE VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES CONNECTED


At least 30 years ago I noticed how volcanoes and earthquakes appeared to be connected, and usually a large earthquake followed a large volcanic eruption somewhere in the world. Now scientists are beginning to study this connection. It took them long enough. Everything is connected! Betsey
Article: A geologic event known as diking can cause strong earthquakes - with a magnitude between 6 and 7, according to an international research team. Diking can occur all over the world but most often occurs in areas where the Earth's tectonic plates are moving apart, such as Iceland, Hawaii and parts of Africa in the East African Rift System. As plates spread apart, magma from beneath the Earth's surface rises into the space, forming vertical magma intrusions, known as dikes. The dike pushes on the surrounding rocks, creating strain.

Challis, ID shown as purple circle and Twin Falls directly south 
Feb. 10, 2016 - TWIN FALLS, IDAHO EXPERIENCING STRANGE BOOMS AND SHAKING
Someone on Facebook, from my home town of Twin Falls, Idaho, near the Snake River Canyon, reported a loud boom yesterday. It might have been a jet sonic boom, but then again may be not. Booms and shaking have been reported in 2010 and 2013, and not related to earthquakes according to the USGS. Twin Falls does not have any known earthquake faults, however Challis, Idaho is 189 miles north of Twin Falls, and one of the largest earthquakes hit Challis on October 28, 1983, registering 6.9 magnitude. Since 1983 there has been smaller earthquakes in the area. Also, Wells, Nevada near the Idaho border experienced a 6.0 earthquake on February 21, 2008. Perhaps this is a huge stretch zone. Is your area experiencing these booms? Read more about the 2013 rumblings in Twin Falls here...  


Cracks open up in Chile after 6.4 earthquake
Feb. 10, 2016 - POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE SHAKES CHILE
Again the Pacific Ring of Fire shows it's power with a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hitting 40km West of Ovalle, Chile at 00:33:05 UTC this morning. It was also followed by a 5.1 magnitude aftershock. The huge
tremors occurred in the Pacific at 12 miles deep. But according to
seismologists, it “did not meet the conditions necessary to generate a
tsunami”. No casualties or damage have been reported. Chile is part of the
'Pacific Ring of Fire”' which is especially vulnerable to earthquakes and
tsunamis. 

What concerns me most is the 5.3 and 4.9 magnitude earthquakes shaking in the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge--a 5.3 and 4.9 hit there early this morning. A 2.6 earthquake shook Volcano, Hawaii, 2.5 in Lakeview, Oregon which has had swarm earthquakes in the past year, and a 2.5 in Lakeland, Washington.  Read more about the Chile earthquake...






Feb. 9, 2016 - SOUTH CAROLINA PLAGUED BY MYSTERIOUS BOOMS ON JAN. 26, 2016

There were reports of booms in New Jersey and New  York, but this is the first I've heard about the mysterious booms in South Carolina. I'd like know from people in Europe and around the world if they are hearing these booms. Please contact me. 

Article: Skyquakes. Mistpouffers. Seneca Guns. The mysterious booms in South Carolina
have many names, but no one knows what causes them. And today the mystery is
back in the spotlight after an unexplained boom rattled the Charleston area. “My whole
house just shook…. anyone else? Weird and heard loud boom on Folly Beach,”
wrote one witness on Facebook. “The whole restaurant here at Shem Creek just
shook! Earthquake?!,” wrote other.
The boom and subsequent vibration startled Charleston-area residents around

Feb. 9, 2016 - PEOPLE WHO APPEAR OUT OF THIN AIR


History is rife with strange tales of people who have mysteriously vanished
from the face of the earth without a trace, but one area that seems to get
decidedly less coverage is the various accounts of those who did just the
opposite, appearing out of nowhere cloaked in mystery and emanating questions
and puzzles around them that have never been satisfactorily answered. Here we
have strangers who have stepped out of thin air from another place, perhaps
even another time or plane of existence, and have gone on to leave impenetrable
mysteries in their wake to this day. Stepping out of blue and into our
imagination, these baffling appearances represent a phenomena every bit as
perplexing as strange disappearances. Let us journey into the bizarre world of
mysterious individuals who seemingly appeared from nowhere.
One of the earliest, most well-known, and indeed bizarre cases of people
appearing out of nowhere occurred in the mid-12th century, when two children
mysteriously appeared in the sleepy village of Woolpit, in the English county
of Suffolk, and went on to become an enduring mystery known as the Green
Children of Woolpit.  Read more...

Feb. 8, 2018 - STRONG EARTHQUAKE HITS PAPUA NEW GUINEA
A 6.3 magnitude earthquake shook Panguna, Papua New Guinea today at 16:19:12 UTC. We are in a big earthquake window--more earthquake worldwide to follow. Right now the South Pacific in vulnerable to powerful earthquakes during this window.  





Feb. 7, 2016 - MORE AND MORE SIGHTINGS OF PLANET X
Again new footage of Nibiru or Planet X next to our sun, caught on
camera in Marbella, Spain. It's most likely planet Nibiru or Planet-X by
optioning out all other possibilities. About a week later 'two
earthquakes' occurred 148 klicks South West. I received several warnings
from my followers this content could be removed. 
 (My thoughts:
I've been predicting more and more people will capture a second sun in
the sky--disinformation will follow on sightings and booms.We are in for quite a ride this year.)



Feb. 6, 2016 - MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS BOOMS IN NEW JERSEY

Question: Please explain what is happening with the booms in New Jersey on Jan. 28, 2016. I find it very interesting that it is getting so much press and the people are not accepting the establishment explanations. [and from another] http://6abc.com/news/navy-says-flight-testing-may-have-resulted-in-sonic-booms/1177618/  A Navy spokeswoman says an F-35C and F-18 from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, were conducting supersonic testing off the coast [Jan 28] afternoon.  The F-35C has a top speed of nearly 1,200 mph. Residents reported hearing loud booms and feeling the ground and buildings shake. The booms were heard as far away as Connecticut. Navy spokeswoman Connie Hempel said supersonic tests flights are done almost daily in the same area but that most sonic booms aren't felt on land. They are conducted offshore in an area called the Test Track, parallel to the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula which is occupied by Delaware, Maryland and Viriginia.  [and from another] https://twitter.com/USGS  I hear the war games at the base every time they do it. I surely should have heard a sonic boom. … Earthquakes rumble, sometimes loudly, but window-rattling booms - multiple times - are not what happens! … Explain to us how 1 sonic boom can cause 6 tremors over 30 minutes from #nj to #ct and I'll believe you. … I live right by the base - no jets flying around and no sonic boom noise. … Why did one sonic boom create reports of six distinct tremors over hours? And why didn't Hammontonians feel it if that was location? [and from another] http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20004vbk#general_region  [and from another] 

http://abcnews4.com/news/local/did-you-feel-it-charleston-social-media-users-report-rumbling-shaking 

Answer: More lies! We are going to hear more disinformation from the military and our leaders as the Earth changes increased throughout the world in the coming months.  There will come a time when everyone will see Planet X and the earthquakes, booms and increased volcanic activity worldwide can't be denied by the establishment. There is much deep core earth movement taking place as Earth responds to the tug of Planet X's magnetic pull on our little planet. My theory is that large earthquake will usually follow the booms and it did after the New Jersey earthquake on Jan. 28. On Jan. 29 a 7.2 earthquake shook Russia. The boom sounds are made by rocks grinding and sliding against each other.  



Feb. 6, 2016 - WILL HUMANITY EXPERIENCE THE HUNDREDTH MONKEY EFFECT?
Article: In the 1950s scientists on an island in Japan were doing a research project involving monkeys. While they were there, the scientists fed the monkeys sweet potatoes by dropping them in the sand in front of the monkeys. While the monkeys liked the sweet potatoes, they didn’t like the sand that covered them. One of the monkeys discovered that she could solve the problem by washing the potatoes in water. Some of her monkey friends observed this and then adopted the same habit. Before long, more and more monkeys on the island were washing the potatoes. 
At some point, all the monkeys on the island began washing them. But this was not the amazing part. Soon monkeys in other areas that had no physical contact with the monkeys on the island starting doing the same thing. It was like the knowledge was now spreading purely from mind to mind.
We often see the Hundredth Monkey Effect in our day-to-day lives. IMany of us who are serious about transforming human consciousness are excited about the potential of the hundredth monkey effect. Read more...

Feb. 5, 2016 -   MORE ON ASTEROID 2013 TX 68
Tags NASA A recently discovered asteroid is scheduled to fly by Earth in March, but NASA can’t quite tell how far away it will be when that happens. One estimate is as close as 11,000 miles, about 95 percent closer than the moon. Space
 

The asteroid known as 2013 TX68, was first discovered three years ago, as its name implies, but the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey was only able to track its path for three days before it entered daytime skies, where monitoring is not possible. That short amount of time precluded scientists from getting a better understanding of what the asteroid’s orbit around the sun looks like.



Feb. 3, 2016 - MYSTERY BOOMS REPORTED IN SWEDEN - NO DAMAGE, NO EXPLANATION


“There
are no traces of anything. No one has been injured and there is no debris or
anything at all indicating that something has gone off. It's really strange.” - Christine Holmberg, Rector, Karlstad, Sweden
Secondary School 


Police and emergency workers responded to
"powerful explosion" at secondary school in middle of Karlstad, Sweden, the afternoon of February 2,
2016, but strangely there was no physical evidence of source or damage, as in
hundreds of other mysterious boom reports around the world since January 2011, also  without physical evidence. 


Expressen reports on the afternoon of February 2, 2016, a “powerful
explosion” was reported throughout the city of Karlstad, Sweden, west of
Stockholm, centered around a secondary school at the center of town. But police
and emergency services investigating could not find any evidence of damage to
buildings or surroundings and called it “strange circumstances.” The
headmistress of the school told Aftonbladet news, “The blast was
terrible. Although I was a good many meters away, it shook the whole building.
Suddenly one of the staff ran in crying out there is a bomb in the sports hall.
As we ran, the emergency services were already arriving.” But nothing was
found, like so many other mysterious, loud boom and metallic screeching reports
around the world since January 2011, as reported more than a hundred times by
Earthfiles.com.

Jan. 31, 2016 - SOMETHING VERY STRANGE ABOUT COMET 67P 
The Rosetta spacecraft
has the best view of comet 67P, but astronomers right here
on Earth are following the famous space rock’s trek across the solar
system too. In the image above, they’ve spotted something very strange: The
comet has two tails.
This shot of 67P was captured by Alan Fitzsimmons on January 19th, 2016,
with the Isaac Newton Telescope at the La Palma Observatory. Using a red filter
and post-processing to pick out distinct structures, Fitzsimmons was able to
spot two separate trails of particles emanating from the icy beast. But fear
not, skywatchers: this isn’t a portent of the End Times. In part, it’s an
optical illusion caused by the comet’s orbit around the sun. (I predicted the first of the year about a comet that will bring awe and wonder to humanity. Could this be the one?) Read more...








Jan. 30, 2016 - POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE HITS RUSSIA EARLY THIS MORNING 
Looks like my boom theory might hold water after all. I wrote yesterday that I didn't buy the Navy's explanation of jet sonic booms over New Jersey causing the booms and earth shaking on Thursday. I believed that it's deep earth movement and the booms and shaking reported worldwide in the past two years are connect to this movement. I've noted a huge earthquake usually following within a day or two of the mysterious booms. The military is going to continue telling us its sonic booms to defuse panic as the earth changes increase this year! EARLY THIS MORNING at 03:25:10 UTC a powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake shook Yelizovo, Russia (see blue dot on map). 




          
Jan. 29, 2016 - EARTHQUAKES TODAY AND BOOM/SHAKING THEORY

If the booms and shaking were really caused by a jet creating a sonic boom over New Jersey yesterday, then I'd expect there won't be any huge earthquakes in the next few days, but my theory is right, there will be a power earthquake or earthquakes in the next few days. I've observed this happening with the mysterious booms and shaking in the past two years.  Today's earthquakes:

Two 4.7 earthquakes shook Tobelo, Indonesia, a 5.2 in the Solomon Islands, 4.5 in Morocco, and swarm earthquakes in Northern california measuring 2.5 to 2.9 and swarm earthquakes near Old Iliamna, Alaska measuring 2.8 and 2.9 magnitude which are probably aftershocks from the 7.1 earthquake in that area on January 24.








Jan. 29, 2016 - BOOMS AND EARTH SHAKING IN NEW JERSEY

Thursday, January 28, Hammonton, New Jersey: The U.S. Navy said one of its aircraft likely created sonic booms in southern New Jersey Thursday that caused people to feel ground-shaking tremors across the state and as far away as Long Island. At 2:24 p.m., the U.S. Geological Survey recorded a sonic boom 3 kilometers north-northeast of Hammonton, New Jersey. It said there was no seismic activity, ruling out the possibility of an earthquake. 



SOURCE OF SONIC BOOM




The U.S. Navy issued a statement late Thursday, saying aircraft were "conducting flight testing in the Atlantic Test Ranges this afternoon that included activities which may have resulted in sonic booms." Sources said the aircraft was an F-35 being tested out of the Navy's Patuxent River facility in eastern Maryland. The USGS provided this explanation as to why people felt the ground shaking at different times:



 Since many have asked: A sonic boom travels through the air with the airplane so it arrives at different ground locations at different times.The USGS said the booms are caused when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound. The group said nine booms occurred and were recorded over the span of 90 minutes.

(My thoughts: As a small child I remember when jets created sonic booms over our house and our windows shook, but never did the ground shake. I sense that as the earth changes increase in the coming months we are going to hear these ridiculous explanations from the military and our leaders who don't want us to panic.)   




This
amazing footage of Planet X aka Nibiru, or one of its moons, was filmed
in California on Dec. 20, 2015. I predicted before the first of the

the sudden announcement made by two Caltech scientists on January 20,
2016 about Planet X or the 9th Planet. They can no longer hide Planet X
behind massive jet chemtrail spraying covering our skies.

January 26, 2016 - MYSTERIOUS BOOMS CONTINUE SINCE JANUARY 2011
UFOs or Sky Quakes?On January 17, 2016 - Loud mystery booms were repeating in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Last January 2015 fifteen states reported unexplained booms. Read more on Earthfiles.com

Friday night, January 15, 2016, residents in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, along the Passaic River reported to police and media very loud, metallic booming sounds between 6 PM and 2 AM Eastern that remain unidentified after investigations. Police received other loud metallic boom reports earlier in the week as well, but have no

Jan. 26, 2016 - CALTECH SCIENTISTS DISCOVER 9TH PLANET OR PLANET X
For years now scientists have debated about Planet X. Does it really exist? Watch this YouTube video on Nibiru aka Planet X by BBC documentary in 2012. On January 20, 2016 California Inst. of Technology astronomers Mike Brown, Ph.D., and Konstantin Batygin, Ph.D., discovered that thirteen objects in the Kuiper Belt surrounding our solar system were all moving together as if influenced by the gravity of a very large object that is so far not visible (below). Illustration of ninth planet with our Sun in the lower right corner by Caltech/R. Hurt.

Jan. 24, 2016 - PREDICTING EARTHQUAKES
Since childhood I've been blessed with the gift for predicting earthquakes and earth related-events, but I also observe earth warnings, which everyone can learn. Read below:

- Earthquake lights are a mysterious phenomenon that happens before an earthquake and is believed to be caused by tectonic stress and sliding rocks under pressure.
- Ozone Gas. Stories abound of animals behaving oddly in the moments before an earthquake: dogs bark incessantly, birds gather in tight flocks, toads flee their ponds. What could they be sensing that humans don't?
That question led a group of University of Virginia physicists to start grinding rocks and measuring gases in a lab experiment designed to mimic an earthquake and see what might be setting the animals off. What they found was dramatic: The rocks they crushed produced ozone gas at levels up to 100 times higher than a smoggy Los Angeles day. (I've smelled this gas in L.A. and have know it was a procurer to a large earthquake). 
- Extreme vertigo/dizziness - many people feel ill and experience nausea and vertigo before an earthquake.
- Animals both domestic and wild react the the geomagnetic changes and stress waves before a strong earthquake.
- Water levels suddenly drop. 
- Are you feeling nervous and anxious? Many people have dreams or intuitive feelings before an earthquake. Through the years I've been shown precognitive dreams of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.





Jan. 24, 2016 -  POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE HITS ALASKA



ANCHORAGE, Alaska - A magnitude 7.1 earthquake knocked items off shelves and

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE SUN GOES QUIET IN 2030

The sun will go into "hibernation" mode around 2030, and it has already started to get sleepy. At the Royal Astronomical Society's annual meeting in July, Professor Valentina Zharkova of Northumbria University in the UK confirmed it - the sun will begin its Maunder Minimum (Grand Solar Minimum) in 15 years. Other scientists had suggested years ago that this change was imminent, but Zharkova's model is said to have near-perfect accuracy.

Nov. 3, 2015 - GEOLOGISTS FEAR WYOMING CRACK MIGHT BE VOLCANO
Note: other giant earth cracks have been forming worldwide this year.
A giant, mysterious crack developing in the state of Wyoming is making everyone knows what is going on. The crack, which first appeared on a Wyoming ranch in late September, is now the size of more than six football fields, and appears to get bigger with each passing day.  According to a report by 9News, the crack is located in the Big Horn Mountain ranges, 40 miles south of Ten Sleep, a small town in Washakie Country in Wyoming. However, contradicting reports have since appeared on several media sites, which suggest that the cracks are located closer to Ten Sleep than first thought. As of now, the crack, which is puzzling geologists and Wyoming residents alike, is a remarkable 600 meters long and 50 meters wide. Read more...


An engineer from Riverton, WY came out to shed a little
light on this giant crack in the earth. Apparently, a wet spring
lubricated across a cap rock. Then, a small spring on either side caused
the bottom to slide out. He estimated 15 to 20 million yards of
movement.




With no earthquakes and a small
amount of movement recorded by the USGS we will have to go with that
explanation until someone comes up with another. Quite a find during a
weekend hunt and beats a few of the “trophies” we have seen.

Over
the weekend a number of reports came in about a crack in the earth
showing up in the southern foothills of the Big Horn Mountains. A friend
of ours, Randy Becker was in the area and captured the above images of
the collapse and shifting of the soil and rock in the area. Estimates by
some put the area at 750 yards long by 50 yards wide.


Another post on Facebook by SNS outfitters stated an opinion by a local engineer,

MYSTERY OF GIANT SINK HOLES IN RUSSIA

Giant sinkholes which started appearing in Yamal Peninsula, Russia last year
remain a mystery to scientists investigating this phenomena around the
world. Theories about what's causing them are numerous... from

however, are not looking for scientific explanation. They prefer to believe
that giant, perfectly round craters, have a 'connection to another world'. Article.


SPIRALS ON MARS IN 2012 - I WAS RIGHT!
In 1978 I woke from a lucid dream, recalling a group of men seated before a large screen or monitor, viewing a rocky desert-like surface. Although the images were black and white, I sensed the surface color was red. Suddenly the men, perhaps scientists and engineers began yelling and patting each other on the back as they viewed the images on the large screen. 

I noted a gigantic ramp formation and spirals on the ground, three-sided pyramid-shaped structures and other geometric objects. I sensed this was real and I was watching a space probe orbiting Mars at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) in Pasadena, California.   

Viking I and Viking 2 probes landed on the surface of Mars between June and August 1976. More than 4,000 photographs were returned. The final transmission was on Nov. 11, 1982.

In 1983 I was invited to a Los Angeles party by friends. A NASA computer scientist was there. I asked him about the images I had seen in my dream and he responded, "How do you know that?" He said there were other spirals on Mars they had dubbed the "Ram's Horns." Then he cautioned me to never discuss this information or my source.  At the time I didn't know if he was for real. But today, much to my surprise, I discovered a video/photograph of Mars on YouTube that clearly shows giant spirals. Talk about getting chills!  This is the high-resolution pictures of Athabasca Valles from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that revealed 269 coils/spirals or "Ram's Horns" up to a hundred feet (30 meters) wide.
