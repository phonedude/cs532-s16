You know what goes great together? Stocks with a side of free phone. Seriously, if you haven't tried it...well, now's your chance. We've teamed up with Handy Apps once again to hook one of you guys up with a free phone – an LG G3, to be exact – but we'll get into that in just a little bit.
First, we want to talk about Handy Apps' Stocks IQ. If you track stocks in any way, this may be an app you want to have installed. It's packed full of useful features for stock monitoring, including current market statistics and company news, watchlists, portfolio management, support for Google Finance, price alerts and notifications, and a lot more. It's also optimized for both phones and tablets, and is completely free.
  
It's worth noting that Stocks IQ doesn't actually sync with a portfolio, but is instead meant to be used as a support tool for traders. It's also a great learning tool for those who may be new to stock tracking. Either way, it's a useful application regardless of how familiar you may or may not be with the market. Grab it below.
Stocks IQ (Playboard) | Stocks IQ (Play Store)
Giveaway
 

This contest is now over.
The final results are listed below. If you've won, you will be contacted in the near future. Congratulations!
Everyone else - keep participating and stay tuned to Android Police so that you don't miss our upcoming giveaway announcements. You can follow AP on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and RSS.

We've also got an LG G3 to give away. While this giveaway is international, there are a couple things worth mentioning here:
International users will get a global, unlocked G3.
US Users will have the option between the variants available on Amazon: Verizon, Sprint, or AT&T. Sorry T-Mo customers.
Got it? Good. Here's how to enter.
a Rafflecopter giveaway
This one will run for one week, ending on Friday, September 26th at 11:59PM PT. Good luck!
