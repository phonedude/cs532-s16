(haha)   Full Review                   Gamevidsftw  January 12, 2016                      Good app, has some issues though Sure it may take a while for the "nanas" to be recieved, but I have one major issue. The other offers page that includes the free webpage games that require you to hit a certain amount of points is rigged. I played the timber man version to try and hit 100 points for whatever amount of nanas I would recieve, but it would purposely register me as losing and forcing an ad on me everytime I reached over 50 points. Seems to me a bit fishy and unfair. Otherwise, everything else is good.   Full Review                   Eric Cartsman  January 16, 2016                      It's... It's OKAY. I first downloaded this app last year June 2015. It went REALLY great. Got my nice $5 apple gift card and it worked! Tried going for the $20 steam gift card and I was so close that it bothered me. Of course, stupid me decided to tell people to invite me and scam them... I lost my account and had to make another one. Gonna uninstall after I'm done rating this awesome app. Is there any chance I can get my account back? ;(   Full Review                   Thundertigerchm AJ /Idunn  February 6, 2016                      It makes me so mad that when I do a offer And download some game and complete the challenges the gave me, I go back on appnana and no matter what I tried I got no freaking Nana's!!! At all! And now its telling me to do more offers and invite more people, but 1 I don't get anything from offers, 2 I can't input s code cause I don't have enough Nana's!? Gosh!! 😡😠   Full Review                   Samsung Phone  February 16, 2016                      Doesn't work My nanas are not added even after 24 hours. I have contact them but nothing.

After I complete one of the things I need to do I go to my history and it still keeps pending! The app is easy for getting gift cards and money, but with this problem I can't get anything!   Full Review                   Mohammad Saad  January 30, 2016                      Very bad It doesn't give poits for completing the offers as written...

It is a complete lie and a total rip off it forces you to install applications on your phone which install malware and spyware half the time it doesn't give you the points and once you get about halfway to A $10 gift card it makes it nearly impossible to get to your goal! I've spent over a hundred and $60 with in app purchases and they make it impossible to even get 10$ back!

I've received maybe points from two. I also open appnana everyday(24 hour period)  and don't always receive my daily points. I know they say it can take a few days but does that mean over a week? I'm not giving up on you appnana,  I have faith in you.   Full Review                   Jeremy Efferding  January 17, 2016                       So far so good.
