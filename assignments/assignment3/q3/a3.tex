Now rank the same 10 URIs from question \#2, but this time 
by their PageRank.  Use any of the free PR estimaters on the web,
such as:

http://www.prchecker.info/check\_page\_rank.php
http://www.seocentro.com/tools/search-engines/pagerank.html
http://www.checkpagerank.net/

If you use these tools, you'll have to do so by hand (they have
anti-bot captchas), but there is only 10.  Normalize the values
they give you to be from 0 to 1.0.  Use the same tool on all 10
(again, consistency is more important than accuracy).

Create a table similar to Table 1:

Table 2.  10 hits for the term \enquote{shadow}, ranked by PageRank.

PageRank	URI
--------	---
0.9		http://bar.com/
0.5		http://foo.com/

Briefly compare and contrast the rankings produced in questions 2
and 3.
