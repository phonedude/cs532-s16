Well, It's Also You","date":1411301580000,"timestamp":1411332314915,"body":"<p>I really wanted to love the iPhone 6 Plus. It has two clear advantages over its smaller sibling -- a bigger, crisper screen and a larger, longer-lasting battery -- that provide tangible benefits. Given that I use my smartphone several hours a day, it seemed like the perfect choice for me as I've been longing for a bigger iPhone for so long, I've nearly switched to an Android model on several occasions. It was against that backdrop that I picked up an iPhone 6 Plus on Friday, expecting to fall in love. Not only hasn't that happened, I'm beginning to doubt it will. Let me tell you about my first date and also make it perfectly clear, you may see things in an entirely different light.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>For the other side of the coin, check out \"<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2014/09/21/dear-samsung-thanks-for-bringing-the-world-the-iphone-6-plus/\">Dear Samsung, Thanks For Bringing The World The iPhone 6 Plus</a>\"\r\n</em></strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_7473\" align=\"\" width=\"1536\"]<img class=\" wp-image-7473\" alt=\"Screenshot 2014-09-21 05.05.28\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/markrogowsky/files/2014/09/Screenshot-2014-09-21-05.05.28.png\"> Too big after all? The leap from 5s to 6 Plus might be more than some can handle. The 6, on the other hand, is a comfortable choice.[/caption]\r\n\r\nMy earliest smartphone was, in fact, an Android model so when the iPhone 5 came out with the \"larger\" screen -- a disappointing jump from 3.5 to 4 inches -- I gave serious consideration to returning to Google-land. At the time, I took a look at the Galaxy Note phablet that was for sale and decided it was just absurdly large. The Galaxy S3, on the other hand, seemed pretty reasonable and very nearly drew me to Android. For whatever reason, I stood pat, eventually picking up a Nexus 7 tablet to add to my mobile arsenal, but sticking with Apple's smartphone platform.\r\n\r\nStill, I grew tired of the small screen, eventually taking to calling it \"puny.\" Lousy for typing, reading, gaming... Really everything -- except using the phone with one hand. Yes, Apple, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O99m7lebirE\">when you have something to market</a>, you're good at telling the story. Never mind, I thought regularly, that you couldn't actually reach the top left corner of the screen without shifting your hand a bit (assuming you hold it right handed). The truth is the iPhone 5 is&nbsp;<em>mostly&nbsp;</em>usable with one hand. With the passage of time, those Note phablets seemed a bit less absurd; or so I thought.\r\n\r\nAfter two days with the iPhone 6 Plus, here's what I can tell you: For an average-sized individual, the 6 Plus is <em>essentially unusable</em> with one hand. If you're just reading a book or watching a video, you can perhaps manage. But if you want to actually do anything?&nbsp;<em>Fuhgedaboudit.&nbsp;</em>The problem is that despite Apple's clever fix in the form of what it calls Reachability -- a double tap on the Home button moves the top of the screen down to the middle -- every actual reach upsets the delicate balance of holding such a large device. To press the Home button, you need to be holding the phone on the lower portion, but once you reach for it, the upper half causes a lever effect and tends to tilt away from you. While I haven't dropped the phone yet, it's hard to imagine spending two years performing such a delicate balancing act.\r\n\r\nBut that's not the only ergonomic issue that readily becomes apparent. These days, many apps allow you to go back by swiping from the left edge of the screen. This is more elegant than ever on the rounded glass of the 6 and 6 Plus. With my 5-foot-10 height and right-hand dominance, my fingers don't reach that edge until I tip the phone a bit. It's doable, but it's not pleasant or easy. In a nutshell, using the phone one-handed,&nbsp;<em>nothing is</em>. Almost every app requires manipulating more of the screen, frequently, than you can reach without tipping, angling, twisting or reaching uncomfortably. This is worse than I imagined it would be.\r\n\r\nNow, I should point out that two-handed use is mostly uneventful, in the best sense of that word. Things just work, much like they do on an iPad Mini. You have to do some shifting to get from the top to the bottom of the screen -- that's still too far for one hand to reach -- but you can quickly learn to use one hand as the primary \"upper\" and one as the \"lower\" most of the time. It's also fair to say that the 6 ounce weight of the Plus feels like very little in two hands and the smooth metal back is quite comfortable to hold.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh, that screen. My goodness. I have a Galaxy S5 with me, which has the best screen I've ever seen on a mobile device. Without running exhaustive tests, I'd say the 6 Plus screen is right up there with it. I'm also fortunate to have an iPhone 6 in the house and while the difference is subtle, it doesn't appear quite as nice. I'm sure some of that is the lower pixel count and lower resolution (326 pixels per inch, like prior iPhones, rather than the 401 of the Plus), but there may be other qualitative differences in the displays that further testing could demonstrate. (The 6, incidentally, is both comfortable to hold and mostly usable with one hand thanks to the thin profile and the much smaller display.)\r\n\r\nThe other immediately apparent downside with the Plus comes from carrying it around. While I have no trouble fitting it in all the pants and shorts I own, it makes its presence known in a way the iPhone 5/5s rarely did. The extra 2 ounces have something to do with that, but the much larger screen area has more impact. <em>You know it's in your pocket</em>. And, sometimes, it's not very comfortable to have it there.&nbsp;In that respect, the smaller iPhone 6, by shedding weight and inches, offers a compromise that becomes clear with real-world use. I also felt like the 6 Plus was big enough it could sneak its way out of some pockets, which might make running across the street an expensive decision. Again, living with that for the next year or two, always being concerned, might be too much to take.\r\n\r\nFinally, there's the battery question. While Apple touts battery-life figures that suggest an iPhone will always get you through the day, power users know differently. In a busy San Francisco or New York outing, I can run down the battery before lunch. The iPhone 6 Plus is clearly improved over the 5s, but I'm not sure it's larger capacity is a panacea. And given that, it might not be worth carrying out a larger device on the false belief it solves all the battery problems when in fact it doesn't.\r\n\r\nI wanted very much to love the iPhone 6 Plus, but barring a change of heart, I think it's going back to Apple. The fault lies both in the phablet, and in myself.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"After some real-world usage, it's already clear that life with a phablet brings compromises. iPhone users accustomed to one-handed use of their device will find the iPhone 6 Plus nearly impossible to manipulate without placing both hands on it.

It has two clear advantages over its smaller sibling — a bigger, crisper screen and a larger, longer-lasting battery — that provide tangible benefits. Given that I use my smartphone several hours a day, it seemed like the perfect choice for me as I’ve been longing for a bigger iPhone for so long, I’ve nearly switched to an Android model on several occasions. It was against that backdrop that I picked up an iPhone 6 Plus on Friday, expecting to fall in love. Not only hasn’t that happened, I’m beginning to doubt it will. Let me tell you about my first date and also make it perfectly clear, you may see things in an entirely different light.</p>\n<p><strong><em>For the other side of the coin, check out “<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2014/09/21/dear-samsung-thanks-for-bringing-the-world-the-iphone-6-plus/\" target=\"_self\">Dear Samsung, Thanks For Bringing The World The iPhone 6 Plus</a>”</em></strong></p>\n<strong><em> </em></strong>\n<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7473\"> \n <img class=\" wp-image-7473\" alt=\"Screenshot 2014-09-21 05.05.28\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/markrogowsky/files/2014/09/Screenshot-2014-09-21-05.05.28.png\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Too big after all? The leap from 5s to 6 Plus might be more than some can handle. The 6, on the other hand, is a comfortable choice.</p> \n</div>\n<p>My earliest smartphone was, in fact, an Android model so when the iPhone 5 came out with the “larger” screen — a disappointing jump from 3.5 to 4 inches — I gave serious consideration to returning to Google-land. At the time, I took a look at the Galaxy Note phablet that was for sale and decided it was just absurdly large. The Galaxy S3, on the other hand, seemed pretty reasonable and very nearly drew me to Android. For whatever reason, I stood pat, eventually picking up a Nexus 7 tablet to add to my mobile arsenal, but sticking with Apple’s smartphone platform.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Still, I grew tired of the small screen, eventually taking to calling it “puny.” Lousy for typing, reading, gaming… Really everything — except using the phone with one hand. Yes, Apple, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O99m7lebirE\">when you have something to market</a>, you’re good at telling the story. Never mind, I thought regularly, that you couldn’t actually reach the top left corner of the screen without shifting your hand a bit (assuming you hold it right handed). The truth is the iPhone 5 is&nbsp;<em>mostly&nbsp;</em>usable with one hand. With the passage of time, those Note phablets seemed a bit less absurd; or so I thought.</p>\n<p>After two days with the iPhone 6 Plus, here’s what I can tell you: For an average-sized individual, the 6 Plus is <em>essentially unusable</em> with one hand. If you’re just reading a book or watching a video, you can perhaps manage. But if you want to actually do anything?&nbsp;<em>Fuhgedaboudit.&nbsp;</em>The problem is that despite Apple’s clever fix in the form of what it calls Reachability — a double tap on the Home button moves the top of the screen down to the middle — every actual reach upsets the delicate balance of holding such a large device. To press the Home button, you need to be holding the phone on the lower portion, but once you reach for it, the upper half causes a lever effect and tends to tilt away from you. While I haven’t dropped the phone yet, it’s hard to imagine spending two years performing such a delicate balancing act.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>But that’s not the only ergonomic issue that readily becomes apparent. These days, many apps allow you to go back by swiping from the left edge of the screen. This is more elegant than ever on the rounded glass of the 6 and 6 Plus. With my 5-foot-10 height and right-hand dominance, my fingers don’t reach that edge until I tip the phone a bit. It’s doable, but it’s not pleasant or easy. In a nutshell, using the phone one-handed,&nbsp;<em>nothing is</em>. Almost every app requires manipulating more of the screen, frequently, than you can reach without tipping, angling, twisting or reaching uncomfortably. This is worse than I imagined it would be.</p>\n<p>Now, I should point out that two-handed use is mostly uneventful, in the best sense of that word. Things just work, much like they do on an iPad Mini. You have to do some shifting to get from the top to the bottom of the screen — that’s still too far for one hand to reach — but you can quickly learn to use one hand as the primary “upper” and one as the “lower” most of the time. It’s also fair to say that the 6 ounce weight of the Plus feels like very little in two hands and the smooth metal back is quite comfortable to hold.</p>\n<p>And, oh, that screen. My goodness. I have a Galaxy S5 with me, which has the best screen I’ve ever seen on a mobile device. Without running exhaustive tests, I’d say the 6 Plus screen is right up there with it. I’m also fortunate to have an iPhone 6 in the house and while the difference is subtle, it doesn’t appear quite as nice. I’m sure some of that is the lower pixel count and lower resolution (326 pixels per inch, like prior iPhones, rather than the 401 of the Plus), but there may be other qualitative differences in the displays that further testing could demonstrate. (The 6, incidentally, is both comfortable to hold and mostly usable with one hand thanks to the thin profile and the much smaller display.)</p>\n<p>The other immediately apparent downside with the Plus comes from carrying it around. While I have no trouble fitting it in all the pants and shorts I own, it makes its presence known in a way the iPhone 5/5s rarely did. The extra 2 ounces have something to do with that, but the much larger screen area has more impact. <em>You know it’s in your pocket</em>. And, sometimes, it’s not very comfortable to have it there.&nbsp;In that respect, the smaller iPhone 6, by shedding weight and inches, offers a compromise that becomes clear with real-world use. I also felt like the 6 Plus was big enough it could sneak its way out of some pockets, which might make running across the street an expensive decision. Again, living with that for the next year or two, always being concerned, might be too much to take.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s the battery question. While Apple touts battery-life figures that suggest an iPhone will always get you through the day, power users know differently. In a busy San Francisco or New York outing, I can run down the battery before lunch. The iPhone 6 Plus is clearly improved over the 5s, but I’m not sure it’s larger capacity is a panacea. And given that, it might not be worth carrying out a larger device on the false belief it solves all the battery problems when in fact it doesn’t.</p>\n<p>I wanted very much to love the iPhone 6 Plus, but barring a change of heart, I think it’s going back to Apple. The fault lies both in the phablet, and in myself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology"},{"id":"channel_3section_141","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Game Changers","url":"/game-changers"},{"id":"channel_3section_22","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Mobile","url":"/mobile"},{"id":"channel_3section_78","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Gear","url":"/gear"},{"id":"channel_4","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","url":"/entrepreneurs"}],"pTagCount":0,"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"iPhone 6 Plus: It's Not You, It's Me...
