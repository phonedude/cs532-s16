Shaun Allan
              Biography
                

        A writer of many prize winning short stories and poems, Shaun Allan has written for more years than he would perhaps care to remember.  Having once run an online poetry and prose magazine, he has appeared on Sky television to debate, against a major literary agent, the pros and cons of internet publishing as opposed to the more traditional method.  Many of his personal experiences and memories are woven into Sin’s point of view and sense of humour although he can’t, at this point, teleport.

But they'd found another planet.
