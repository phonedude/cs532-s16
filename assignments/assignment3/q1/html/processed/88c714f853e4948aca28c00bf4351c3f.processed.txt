Over the years, we've seen the iPhone evolve—and grow. It began as just the iPhone. Soon it learned how to 3G, it gained an S (it would lose and gain this every other year), and it even learned to read fingerprints. Years of hard work and dedication have made the iPhone into what it is today, the iPhone 6 Plus. Join us live as we explore this gargantuan iPhone 6 Plus.
Oh, were you looking for the normal-sized iPhone 6 teardown? We've got that, too.
This year we're doing the iPhone 6 Plus in English, Français, Deutsch, Español, Italiano, Nederlands, Русский, and 中文.

                           iPhone 6 Plus Teardown                        
 ¶ 





Ladies and gentlemen, the time is nigh. Today, we stand among a select few in the shadow of a colossus, the iPhone 6 Plus. But what makes this enormous phone special? We're glad you asked:




Apple A8 processor with 64-bit architecture




M8 second-generation motion coprocessor




16, 64, or 128 GB onboard storage capacity




5.5-inch 1920x1080 pixels (401 ppi) Retina HD display




8 MP iSight camera (with 1.5µ pixels, phase-detection autofocus, and optical image stabilization) and a 1.2 MP FaceTime camera




Touch ID home button fingerprint sensor, barometer, 3-axis gyro, accelerometer, ambient light sensor




802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi‑Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 + NFC + 20-band LTE

News flash from the Land Down Under:




The line was already 50 people strong yesterday around 1 PM local Aussie time.




By 7 AM there were close to a thousand people in line.




Our teardown team was #53 in line, and the Apple Store only had 40 iPhone 6 Plus models in stock.




But hey, no worries—we got our hands on an iPhone 6 Plus, all thanks to a wonderful Australian iFixit fan named Ricky. Thanks Ricky!




It turns out Ricky is not related to this Ricky.





After our little Apple Store adventure, we skedaddled back to MacFixit Australia, where the teardown's taking place. We want to send out a big thanks to our good friends at MacFixit for letting us use their office. They stock Mac and iPhone upgrades/accessories, and also carry our iFixit toolkits. Thanks MacFixit Australia!

Coming soon to a supermarket near you, the iPhone 6 Plus Pop-Tarts Bluetooth/NFC speaker.




The iPhone 6 Plus measures in at 158.1 mm long, 77.8 mm wide, and 7.1 mm thick. Quite literally bigger than a Pop-Tart.




At 7.1 mm, it's the thicker of the new crop of iPhones—but thickness is the one dimension in which it undercuts last year's iPhone 5s, which measured 7.6 mm.










 


  

Edit
Step 4

Edit
Step 4
 ¶ 





Just like the iPhone 5s, the iPhone 6 Plus is available in three different colors: Silver, Gold, and Space Gray. Of course we went for the Gold.




The iPhone 6 Plus is identified by its model number: A1524.




Much to the distress of some reviewers, both iPhone 6 models feature a noticable camera "bump". It seems that Apple was unable to shave enough thickness off of the camera sensor to keep it flush with the rest of the chassis. The lens cover may be made out of sapphire glass, but we're still concerned about what this design choice might mean for durability.




Much like the HTC One M8, the iPhone 6 Plus features two plastic antenna stripes on the outer case. These stripes help with wireless reception that would otherwise be blocked by an all-metal outer case.

Step 5

It seems Apple is reluctant to switch from Pentalobe screws to good ol' regular Phillips screws. Luckily, we brought our Pro Tech Screwdriver Set to remove those pesky Pentalobe screws.




While proprietary screws are not our favorite, we are happy that we don't have to go straight to heat.

Step 6
 ¶ 





It's iSclack time! This handy tool allows us to easily shuck the display assembly from the rear enclosure.




We proceed cautiously, remembering the surprise from last time.




With no noticeable booby traps, we proceed to open our little gold treasure chest.




Apple's rerouting of the Touch ID sensor cable recalls the cleaner design (and safer opening procedure) of the iPhone 5—the iPhone with the highest repairability score to date.





Much like iPhones of the past, the display assembly cables are held securely to the logic board by a metal bracket.









 


  

Edit
Step 7
 ¶ 




 


 


  

Edit
Step 7
 ¶ 





With the display assembly removed, we get our first look at the innards of the iPhone 6 Plus.




The internal layout of the iPhone 6 Plus appears to be similar to the 5s, but we immediately notice the sheer size of the battery. Based on its volume alone, we suspect the iPhone 6 Plus will be no slouch when it comes to battery life.










 


  

Edit
Step 8
 ¶ 




   




 

 

 


 


  

Edit
Step 8
 ¶ 





The home button assembly is secured by a metal bracket. Removing the bracket allows us to simply pop the home button off the front panel assembly.




This design is on-par with last year's home button—modular, if a bit time-consuming to get to in the event of a repair.









 


  

Edit
Step 9
 ¶ 




  




 

 


 


  

Edit
Step 9

The front-facing camera is part of a larger cable assembly, which includes the earpiece speaker, microphone, and ambient light sensor. Both reside on the front panel assembly.









 


  

Edit
Step 10
 ¶ 




 


 


  

Edit
Step 10
 ¶ 





Next we decide to remove the metal plate from the front panel assembly.




In a big win for repairability, Apple has completely redesigned how the home button connects to the main board. Gone is the awkwardly short and fragile cable of the iPhone 5s days. Instead, Apple has made the effort to run the home button cable all the way to the opposite end of the phone. We're quite happy to see this improvement!




We can't think of a reason to extend the cable this way except to improve repairability. Thank you, Apple.










 


  

Edit
Step 11

Edit
Step 11
 ¶ 





The next logical step is to remove the battery from the iPhone 6 Plus.




The battery connector is covered by a metal bracket, which we dispose of using our metal tweezers.




Near the bottom of the battery, we locate some sticky pull tabs.




Here's what we know about sticky iPhone battery pull tabs: pull it right, and it is super easy; pull it wrong, and it is the end of the world.




This adhesive is similar to a 3M Command adhesive, and when you pull the tab correctly it shears the entire strip off.

Step 12

Edit
Step 12
 ¶ 





After saying the magic words, the 43-gram, 4.7" x 1.9" x 0.13" battery mystically lifts off the rear case enclosure.




In line with rumors, the battery is rated at 3.82 V and 11.1 Wh of energy, for a total of 2915 mAh—nearly double the capacity of the 1560 mAh unit in the iPhone 5s, and slightly larger than the 2800 mAh burner in the Galaxy S5.




Between the larger battery and improvements in power efficiency, Apple touts a talk time of up to 24 hours on 3G, and 384 hours of standby time.




The battery found in the Plus is larger than the standard iPhone 6's 6.91 Wh, 1810 mAh battery—which explains the longer life, despite the much larger screen.

This is new! We have something new! The vibrator assembly is located to the right of the battery, below the logic board.




Do you remember Jimmy? Of course you do. Everyone remembers Jimmy. With the help of Jimmy, we pry open the vibrator assembly.




Thanks Jimmy! Inside we find a delicate array of copper coils. They create alternating magnetic fields that shake a permanent magnet mass, which rides on a couple of springs.

The rear-facing camera is easily dispatched with a pair of tweezers.




The back of the iSight camera is labeled DNL432 70566F MKLAB.




Just like the iPhone 5s, the 6 Plus features an 8 MP (with 1.5µ pixels) ƒ/2.2 aperture rear-facing camera. The 6 Plus brings two new additions to the table: optical image stabilization, and "Focus Pixel" phase-detection autofocus.




Phase-detection autofocus has been around for awhile in DSLRs, but is relatively new to smartphones. However, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus aren't the first to feature it — the Samsung Galaxy S5 had it first.

Such wiggles. Much wiggles.

Step 16

Edit
Step 16
 ¶ 





Apple loves to focus on their cameras, touting the iPhone as the world's most popular camera in their Keynote. So what's behind the lens? Let's take a peek...




Using a plastic opening tool and some steady fingers, we remove the camera housing.




While it may not look like much here, the updates found in the iPhone 6 Plus's camera (along with the increased storage) have piqued the interest of amateur and indie filmmakers. We just hope this camera is ready for its closeup...









 


  

Edit
Step 17
 ¶ 




  




 

 


 


  

Edit
Step 17
 ¶ 





A deeper look at the inside of the rear-facing camera reveals just what we expect: a small lens.




Beneath the lens we see the camera's sensor.




The key feature differentiating this camera from that of the standard iPhone 6 is optical image stabilization—a technology we've seen before. The lens element on the left is nested into a tiny metal cage, nudged to and fro by the electromagnetic coils surrounding the sensor on the right.




Constant readings from the gyroscope and the M8 motion coprocessor give the iPhone 6 Plus detailed data on the movements of your shaky human hands, allowing it to compensate by rapidly moving the lens assembly. Result: sharper, clearer photos, even in low-light environments.

Step 18

Edit
Step 18

It's about time we remove the logic board, secured tightly to the rear case enclosure by a few screws.




But before we finish, we're reminded to spudger away an antenna connector from the back of the logic board.

Step 23

Edit
Step 23
 ¶ 





The iPhone 6 Plus's solitary speaker comes out next.




The modularity of the speaker design is appreciated, even if its markings are inscrutable. The manufacturing origins of this speaker remain shrouded in secrecy, for now.









 


  

Edit
Step 24
 ¶ 




   




 

 

 


 


  

Edit
Step 24
 ¶ 





The Lightning connector assembly is comprised of the headphone jack, Lightning connector, and a few antenna connectors.




Cable packages like this are great in terms of space-saving, but not-so-great when your headphone jack decides it doesn't like being pulled on every day.









 


  

Edit
Step 25
 ¶ 




   




 

 

 


 


  

Edit
Step 25

We turn our focus to the top of the rear case enclosure, where a plethora of antennas await. These antennas prove to be no match for our trusty tweezers though.









 


  

Edit
Step 26
 ¶ 




   




 

 

 


 


  

Edit
Step 26
 ¶ 





As we near the end of the teardown, we come across both the power button ribbon cable assembly and the volume button ribbon cable assembly.




Both assemblies consist of tiny components strung on thin, fragile cables like twinkle lights.









 


  

Edit
Step 27
 ¶ 




  




 

 


 


  

Edit
Step 27
 ¶ 





We're button-pushers around here, so we took particular interest in this fancy new rubber gasket surrounding the power button.




Similar gaskets surround the volume buttons. Altogether, this seems to represent a move toward increased water/dust resistance, and therefore improved durability.

Step 28
 ¶ 




  




 

 


 


  

Edit
Step 28
 ¶ 





We have slain the giant. The iPhone 6 Plus earned a respectable seven out of ten, an improvement over the iPhone 5s. Here's why:




Continuing the trend from the iPhone 5 series, the display assembly comes out of the phone first, simplifying screen repairs.




The battery is straightforward to access. Removing it requires a proprietary pentalobe screwdriver and knowledge of the adhesive removal technique, but is not difficult.




The fingerprint sensor cable has been re-routed, fixing a significant repairability issue with the iPhone 5s and making the phone much safer to open. (On the 5s, the cable is easily torn if a user is not careful while opening the phone.)




The iPhone 6 Plus still uses proprietary Pentalobe screws on the exterior, requiring a specialty screwdriver to remove.




Apple does not share repair information for the iPhone 6 Plus with independent repair shops or consumers.

If this has 1GB of RAM, it's going to be bricked like iPhone 3G, iPhone 4 with 3GS specs and 4x pixels can't run iOS7, like iPhone 4S can't handle iOS8, like iPad 1's 256MB of RAM, like iPad 3 with 4x pixels on iPad 2 specs. iPhone 5 will run iOS11 fine with 1GB and iPhone 6 Plus will lag with less available memory.

The part no. of SDRAM (F8164A3PM-GD-F) can be found on the right of Apple A8 SOC.
According to the datasheet, F is the product family (Mobile LPDDR3 SDRAM); A is the power supply interface (1.8V and 1.2V); 3 is the revision; PM is the package code.
This SDRAM should be a customized product with customized package (the SDRAM in Apple A7 SOC is F8164A1PD while the standard part no. is F8164A1MA).

can you check to see if the camera ring is magnetic in anyway ?? there was a patent filed back in jan 2014 for a similar magnetic ring by apple. and the ring is what ether keeps the camera steady or what holds on different lenses. i think this is maybe why the camera protrudes.

I'm amazed at how people do not understand RAM usage in a modern OS.  Android still suffers from outdated methods, so it needs more RAM.  iOS and WP do not need more RAM.  More RAM would provide zero benefit.

He's right. Java requires an absurd amount of RAM since it is an interpreted language, meaning that your phone has to recompile an application every few seconds! But iPhone runs on C++ which is super conservative with ram and in all honesty, all iPhone apps only need at max 312mb of ram while Android uses the whole lot.

Constant readings from the gyroscope and the M8 motion coprocessor give the iPhone 6 Plus detailed data on the movements of your shaky human hands, allowing it to compensate by rapidly moving the lens assembly. Result: sharper, clearer photos, even in low-light environments.

I am still puzzled by the fact that both models have the M8 and MP67B chips. So, why do you say that OIS is only in the 6+ model?

The best part about the iPhone 6 plus is it's size. I think Apple are really out there satisfying two variants of customers - those who prefer large screens and those who are comfortable with the smaller screens. Also, I kinda found this awesome site that is already giving them away in Dubai before everyone else. You guys should check em' out - http://www.alshop.com/apple-iphone-6

Why are people so caught up on the RAM?  It's like assuming that a V6 engine is going to be better than a turbo charged 4-cylinder solely because it has more cylinders.  It's all about what you can do with it.  Yeah, the iPhone 6 only has 1GB of RAM but with Apple's know-how it's like getting the speed & performance of a V8 but with the gas mileage of a 4-cylinder engine.  It's win-win.  It's great that your phone has 4 or more GB of RAM but that doesn't stop my 1GB phone from blowing your battery covers off in the Geek Bench 1/4 mile.

Apple's website seems to suggest the various flavours of iPhone 6 Plus have support from 3 up to 6 separate mobile standards (A1522 vs. A1524 vs. CDMA vs. GSM flavours). From the chips you saw in the teardown, do you think the various support indicates hardware variations for each model? Or do you think the hardware is the same for all models, and the flavours are a result of the regional firmware installed?

If this has 1GB of RAM, it's going to be bricked like iPhone 3G, iPhone 4 with 3GS specs and 4x pixels can't run iOS7, like iPhone 4S can't handle iOS8, like iPad 1's 256MB of RAM, like iPad 3 with 4x pixels on iPad 2 specs. iPhone 5 will run iOS11 fine with 1GB and iPhone 6 Plus will lag with less available memory, it need a iphone cleanup tool.

Apple is most likely primarily focused on the ease of assembly rather than ease of repair. 

Hacked2123 -

Exactly. A short cable that has to be attached like the iPhone 5S means a time-robbing assembly step that's done in tight situations.
Making the cable long may cost 10 cents more in materials costs, but if it saves the worker 20 seconds of time, it increases manufacturing throughput of that worker and thus makes up for the extra cost.

Big business.  For instance Invensense in iPhones for first time ever.  If they are in the 6 also, that is 200+million chips sold over the next year.  Revenues/Cash Flow up.  Buy some stock(hopefully you already owned some or atleast some calls)!  This teardown represents billions of dollars.....the question is who's making it.

From the block diagram it seems the AS3923 is connecting to the antenna not the NFC controller.
Fits to the description saying that the chip is replacing the drivers of the controller.

It's time to speak out for your right to repair
Dear New Yorkers,
Right now, New York has a chance to pass the first Fair Repair bill in
      the nation. We have a chance to guarantee our right to repair electronics—like
      smartphones, computers, and even farm equipment. We have a chance to help
      the environment and stand up for local repair jobs—the corner mom-and-pop
      repair shops that keep getting squeezed out by manufacturers.
The Fair Repair Bill, known as S3998 in the State Senate
      and A6068 in the State Assembly,
      requires manufacturers to provide owners and independent repair businesses
      with fair access to service information, security updates, and replacement parts.
If you agree with us, tell your representatives that you believe repair should be fair, affordable, and accessible.
      Stand up for the right to repair in New York.

Massachusetts,
The people of Massachusetts have always stood up for their
      right to repair. In 2012, voters passed a law that ensured
      residents' right to repair their car wherever they wanted.
      Now, it's time to do the same for electronics.
With the Digital Right to Repair Bill, H.3383, we have a chance
      to guarantee our right to repair electronics — like smartphones,
      computers, and even farm equipment. We have a chance to help
      the environment and stand up for local repair jobs—the corner
      mom-and-pop repair shops that keep getting squeezed out by
      manufacturers.
The Digital Right to Repair Bill requires manufacturers to
      provide owners and independent repair businesses with fair
      access to service information, security updates, and
      replacement parts.
If you agree with us, find out who represents you in the
      Massachusetts legislature. Tell them you support the
      bipartisan Digital Right to Repair Bill. Tell them that you
      believe repair should be fair, affordable, and accessible.
      Stand up for the right to repair in Massachusetts.
