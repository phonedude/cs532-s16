Last month, NASCAR driver Tony Stewart struck and killed sprint car driver Kevin Ward Jr., who had left his car and walked onto the track at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in upstate New York. According to witnesses, Ward was attempting to confront Stewart after a collision between the two had disabled Ward's car.
On Tuesday, Ontario County District Attorney Michael Tantillo decided the decision on whether or not to charge Stewart should rest with a grand jury. In the weeks prior, Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero had said several times investigators lacked the evidence to support criminal intent.
However, that didn't stop others, like Kevin Ward Sr., from questioning Stewart's motives. 
"Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him," the father of the deceased driver said a few days after the incident.
What do you think: Do you agree with the decision to bring Tony Stewart's case before a grand jury?
