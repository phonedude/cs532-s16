Aujourd’hui nos joueurs peuvent rivaliser avec de nombreuses équipes internationales et nous venons de la renforcer à nouveau. Aujourd’hui, le protoss Corréen TAiLS nous a rejoint pour devenir notre tête d’affiche de la team pro. Ceci nous permet d’insister sur notre volonté de s’investir encore plus sur starcraft et de tirer nos talentueux joueurs vers le haut.Translation with google :D if anyone thigs its not good feel free to post it and ill change it :D Invasion eSport becomes a team starcraft quite substantial. Today our players can compete with many international teams and we have to strengthen it again. Today, the Protoss Corréen Tails joined us to become our Headlining the pro team. This allows us to emphasize our willingness to invest more on starcraft and draw our talented players up.http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/User:Inv-Chef/Invasion_esportThis is theyrs Wiki , from whath i see they have Noblesse too :D

Didn't know about them until now, that's a pretty good pick for them.Also, quick translation : "Invasion eSports is becoming an important Starcraft team. Today, our players are able to compete with many international teams and we just made it even stronger. Today, the Korean Protoss TAiLS is joining us to be the ace player of our pro team. This allows us to insist on our involvement in Starcraft and to make our talented players become even better."edit : according to their website, they are still recruiting new players for their pro team (masters+). I couldn't find anything about their sponsors though, it looks like they don't have any.

Best of luck to Tails! Hopefully, this team doesn't screw him over. 




One of my math students just handed in to me an essay on quadratics used in sports, and it's entitled Paraballin'. This is why I became a teacher.

Played some games vs Tails on NA ladder a couple of weeks ago. He said he wants to play WCS America and needed the 200 wins.This was before the WCS changes were announced, but I guess he wants to live in the US?Good luck to Tails, really like him. Still remember his double kill vs IM, destroying both Mvp and Nestea!edit: Since it's a french team, obv he wants to live in EU!

Not the ex-MVP player I was most hoping would get a team, but still very cool for Tails!

Also they made arrangements with Axiom regarding TRUE's staying at Axiom's gaming house. They seem pretty legit.I've never heard of Invasion e-sports however, and I'm french-speaking...

They look legit. They even do content creation on their website - at the bottom of their front page was an interview with Akane (why have other SC2 content-makers not interviewed Akane?). Hope they can support TAiLS in the ways he needs and that he can put them on the map.




Starcraft: Where challenging the notion of one nationality having absolute superiority over all others and calling for greater diversity in competitive play means you're a racist.
