<title>Coffee Caramels</title>
<description>
Caramels are much desired the world over and can be made in many different flavors. While vanilla and chocolate are the most popular ones, coffee pairs exceptionally well with the buttery tones of caramel.
The coffee caramels can be wrapped in cellophane as shown in On Baking, or can be dipped in milk or dark chocolate couverture and finished with a touch of fleur de sel, if so desired.

<title>Artisanal Belgian Chocolate Truffles</title>
<description>
Truffles can be made either by using heavy cream, chocolate and a sweetener or are made with butter, chocolate and a sweetener. Both can be delicious and have their own distinct characteristic. If you desire to make truffles with well pronounced flavor (from liquor, extracts, tea, coffee etc) then butter based truffles may be a good choice. The creamed butter mixture, which is consequently light and airy makes it possible for flavors to really shine through, which can be a challenge when using bitter chocolate.
These truffles are flavored with homemade coffee extract and sprinkled with nougatine.

<title>Lemon Curd Plated</title>
<description>
Lemon, lime or passion fruit curd can easily be turned into delicious desserts which are much appreciated by our customers. Curds made over Bain Marie can be a lengthy process which oftentimes keeps us from making it. The good news is that this formula allows for quick results with unsurpassed smoothness.
Use it for sandwiching petit four, serve with scones, filling for tarts or as shown here as a plated dessert.
Assembly:
Prepare curd and pour in frame. Set in refrigerator for one hour and then place in freezer until solid.
Prepare meringue and streusel.
Cut frozen curd quickly into desired size. Place on plate. Allow for defrosting, about 5 minutes.
Decorate with baked meringue, streusel, berries etc.
Quick Lime Curd | Quick lemon curd
This recipe is from On Baking (Named in Europe the best professional book of the world) published with permission from Pearson Prentice Hall
Yield: 1 lb 4 oz (619 g)
4 oz
Lime or lemon juice
120 g
6.5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
195 g
0.14 oz
zest
4 g
4 oz
Eggs
120 g
6 oz
Unsalted butter*, very soft
180 g
To use curd as shown in picture use a square frame with approximate size of 9 x 9 inch (23 x 23 cm). Wrap plastic food wrap tightly around frame to create a bottom. Set aside on a baking sheet.
Curd will set properly when made as indicated. Adding one sheet of bloomed gelatin (after cooking process) or one extra egg white (along with whole eggs) may be helpful for plating purpose as this will provide a slightly firmer set.
Bring citrus juice with half of sugar to a boil.
Meanwhile in a bowl whisk eggs with remaining sugar until well combined but not mixed to a thick ribbon.
Temper the egg mixture with a third of boiling above. Pour the tempered mixture into boiling juice and whisk vigorously until boiling and thickened, about a minute. (For large batches increase the boiling time)
Remove from heat and cool on an ice bath to 120°F (50°C)
Add the butter in increments, stirring well with a spatula or add the butter using an immersion blender.
Pour immediately into frame or use in glasses, tart shells etc.
*use high quality butter (82% butterfat) for best results.

<title>Ghent</title>
<description>
Ghent, place of my birth.
With thousands of you visiting chefeddy.com on a daily basis I thought it may be a good idea sharing something more than another recipe. After all, being in the food industry may spark an interest in visiting Belgium some day. Ghent Belgium is rated # 3 on National Geographic’s Travelers list of beautiful historic places. Ghent is nestled between Brussels and Bruges, about a good 40 minute drive either way. Many tourists only visit the named above, too bad for them, as the Historic center of Ghent boasts a complete different type of “feel” and architecture than that of Brussels. It is a must see indeed. The historic center is car free thus you walk along the people who live and work in Ghent and who will quickly make you feel as you already belong. This is NOT a city where you feel as a tourist who MUST visit or buy something to absorb the place. Ghent will slow you down and will make you take your time to enjoy a patio with good coffee, Belgian beer, lunch, dinner, dessert etc. Stay as long as you want on the patio, no one will rush you as the Gent HORECA (HOtel, REstaurant, CAfé) owners will respect and be truly grateful for your visit.
It is true that you can eat exceptionally well in Belgium, (the amount of Michelin rated star restaurants per capita is extraordinarily high). But most of us do not frequent these on a daily basis. When we are in the historic area of Ghent we frequent many restaurants and many are very good, but everyone has favorites and I am sharing mine. For coffee we like to stop at 3,14 (Pi) at the Groentemarkt. Delicious cappuccino and coffee served in a friendly manner in a cool interior make it a great spot indeed. Picture below 3,14
For lunch or dinner we favor restaurant The Graslei found on n°7 of the street of the same name. When weather is good, take a seat on the breathtaking patio overlooking water and buildings dating from the 13 th century. If the weather is slightly cold, you can still sit on the patio as luxury blankets are on each and every chair and outdoor heaters will be on. Inside, the décor is beautiful, immaculate and stylishly Belgian. Retaining parts of the old building mixed with the new. The food you say? Always delicious and very generous and will make you want to come again, even the same day. Ilse, the proprietor will greet you with tremendous enthusiasm and Jonas and the other attentive wait staff will serve you gracefully and respectfully. Plenty of excellent wine choices at the Graslei, although for lunch or in the afternoon on the patio I may reach for one of Belgium’s most delicious beers, a Trippel Karmeliet, a beer I also use on occasion to cook savory dishes.

<title>Easy Tiramisu</title>
<description>
When preparing desserts for huge events, having enough equipment can be an issue. Who has, let’s say 800 individual rings handy? Therefore I like to teach students ways of using ordinary equipment and yet, still obtaining stylish results. One example is featured here. A standard American type sheet pan is used to obtain this dessert. First thin ladyfinger batter was spread onto a sheet pan and baked. Once cooled and released is was placed on a plastic food film lined sheet pan. Moistened with coffee syrup and then topped with mascarpone cream. After freezing it was released from the pan and cut into rectangle sized shapes.
Mascarpone cream for Tiramisu
Yield: 33 cm x 45 cm (13 x 18 inch) size sheet pan.
8)
Egg yolks
8
4 oz
Water
120 ml
6 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
180 g
4
Gelatin leaves (optional*)
4
16 oz
Mascarpone cheese
480 g
2 tsp
Vanilla extract (Optional)
10 ml
12 oz
Heavy cream
360 g
*If using this cream to fill in verrines (glasses) gelatin can be omitted.
Place gelatin leaves in very cold water and set aside.
In a cold bowl whisk heavy cream to very soft, barely a ribbon consistency. Over-whipping will result in poor results. Set aside.
Fill a saucepan with a small amount of water and bring to a boil and then turn to a low simmer.  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks and measured water. Add sugar and whisk well. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the yolk mixture reaches at least 165°F (74°C). Remove from heat.
Remove the gelatin leaves from the water and squeeze well to remove excess water. Whisk the gelatin into the yolk mixture. Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and whisk smooth.
Add the soft whipped heavy cream and gently fold into the above using a spatula. Fill into the mold immediately.

<title>Creamy Cheesecake</title>
<description>
Philadelphia Cream cheese is indeed one of the few cheeses which make it possible to create smooth, delectable and creamy cheesecake. However, using a large percentage of this type of cheese for the production of cheesecake, can result in cakes which tend to be a bit heavy for today’s consumer. Therefore I prefer to mix a rather large amount of Greek Yogurt into the cheese mixture. It makes it lighter, while at the same time making it superbly creamy. Greek yogurt also provides a slight tangy flavor found in cream cheese.
When I teach cheesecakes, I have noticed that students tend to pay close attention to the demos and instruction. As is the case with so many things, something as simple as cheesecake is not that simple at all. Oftentimes cheesecakes result in products which “glue” to our palate.
Key things to remember when making cheesecake:
Use cream cheese which is at room temperature. It cuts the amount of time that the mixture will be mixed. Long mixing times breaks down cream cheese and results in a thin batter and consequently a crumbly cheesecake.
Mix on lowest speed possible. Mixing on medium or high speed incorporates air cells. This “soufflés” the cheesecake during baking, but since there is no starch present, it will collapse when removed from oven. This makes it not only unsightly, but it also creates a dry feel in the mouth.
Use a Bain Marie and low temperatures when baking. It creates a superior smooth textured cheesecake.
This recipe does not allow freezing of the cake.
Cheesecake
Yield: 12-14 servings.
1 lb 8 oz
Cream cheese, Philadelphia
720 g
9 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar

5
Large eggs
5
1tsp
Vanilla extract
5 ml
.25 oz
Lemon zest
9 g
1 lb 4 oz
Fage, Greek Yogurt
600 g
Choose a 20 cm (8 inch) spring form pan wrapped in 3 ply aluminum foil or for a plated dessert use a frame placed on 3 ply aluminum foil. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with extra granulated sugar. Set aside.
On lowest speed using a paddle attachment mix room temperature cheese and sugar. When smooth and lump free ad one egg at a time waiting for previous added egg to be fully incorporated.
Add vanilla, lemon zest and yogurt and mix to combine.
Pour into buttered and sugared molds of choice and place in Bain Marie, bake at 325°F (160°C) until center of cheesecake no longer trembles. Time will depend on pan used.
Unmold next day onto a prebaked crust of choice.

<title>Cinnamon Swirl Raisin Bread</title>
<description>
While I lived in Belgium I was puzzled why cinnamon was used in such large amounts in baked goods in the United States. Later I learned that the type of cinnamon used in North America and many European countries differ. American Pastry Chefs and Bakers mainly use Korintje and Vietnamese “Saigon” Cassia Cinnamon while many European countries use Ceylon Cinnamon. Most baked items can only use a small amount of Ceylon cinnamon since the citrusy and peppery notes it contains quickly become domineering. Vietnamese cinnamon, although not apologetic in flavor intensity works in sweet harmony with sugar, vanilla, caramel and butter.
Interesting to note that for centuries Ceylon cinnamon was considered the best in the world, however selective plantings and hybridizing made Vietnamese Cassia Cinnamon a true star, especially in cookies, breakfast items, breads etc.
In the United States raisin bread is often made containing a “cinnamon swirl”. This swirl is obtained by rolling cinnamon raisin dough into a long rectangle. It is then sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar mixture and rolled up. For an unsurpassed result use high quality Vietnamese Cassia cinnamon. The recipe for cinnamon sugar is below; the raisin bread recipe is in |On Baking|, edition 3 on page 250.
Yield: 8 ounce, 240 gram
1 oz
Vietnamese cinnamon
30 g
7 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
210 g
Mix the ingredients.

<title>Candied Kumquat And Lime Curd Filled Toasted Hazelnut Shortbread</title>
<description>

Toasted hazelnuts deliver an incomparable flavor to this shortbread. For optimum flavor, toast hazelnuts in a medium temperature oven until the heart of hazelnuts are golden brown. I do not advise to grind hazelnuts in a food processor without another ingredient present; it most often leads to hazelnut paste. Adding pastry flour to the toasted hazelnuts prevents this from happening.
For optimum flavor prepare dough at least one day in advance as in most cases a fuller aroma develops.
Needed for Assembly:

<title>Kumquat Pink Grapefruit Marmalade</title>
<description>

Marmalades with fresh tasting and refined flavor notes can be very delicious on scones, toast, fillings for certain cakes etc. Combining varieties of citrus into marmalade can create most delectable results and I suggest being adventurous in creating your own. For this particular recipe I use in my opinion, two of some of the most underused fruits in the baking lab: kumquats and Pink Grapefruit. A delightful combination that I particularly like to use with chocolate desserts.
Citrus contains an abundance of pectin which can make the preparation of marmalades quick and efficient and leads to “fresh” (not cooked) flavors. For some citrus marmalades or gelée with low amounts of peel (therefore low amounts of pectin) I will bundle the seeds in a cheesecloth pouch and cook along with the mixture. Seeds of citrus contain pectin as well which will be released during cooking. In general I prefer to use organic fruits when I will use the peel or zest since they are treated with chemicals.
 
Kumquat Pink Grapefruit Marmalade
 




13.5 oz
Kumquats
400 g



1 oz
Pink Grapefruit zest
30 g



13.5 oz
Grapefruit-meat only
400 g



1 lb 8 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
700 g



















































 
 

















































































































Slice kumquats in thin slices and place in a nonreactive saucepan. Add grapefruit zest and grapefruit meats cut in small pieces. Add sugar and combine.
Allow sugar to melt to make stirring over heat easier. Bring to a boil while stirring and simmer on low for approximately 20 minutes or until properly thickened. Cooking on high heat will prevent sugar from penetrating the peel of kumquat and may create crystallization.
If cooked to soft and slightly runny stage (ideal for filling cakes) keep marmalade frozen to prevent spoilage.

<title>Irish Cream Chocolates</title>
<description>

Chocolates filled with liqueur are some of the more complex types of confections made. One classic method to prepare these is to pour liqueur syrup into starch molds, which is a technique that easily can result in disappointment. Many factors such as dryness of starch, humidity of work environment, and syrup have an effect on the success of these confections. A simpler and quicker manner is to fill purchased truffle shells with liquor syrup. Either process, when correctly finished in the right work environment, the surface of the liqueur syrup will obtain a crystallized sugar shell which is then enrobed in couverture chocolate.
Although this may be a classic method of sealing liqueur into chocolates, one may question if it is really the best. Many people feel objection to the crunchy sugar shell and it is their primary reason why they do not consume these. Let’s be honest, it is an odd texture indeed and no other chocolates contain crystallized sugar. If crystallized sugar was delicious or had great texture, we certainly would include it into other chocolates.
Alternatives to crystallized sugar crust are possible and may have their own set of issues; however they still are my preferred method for making liqueur filled chocolates.

Irish Cream Liqueur




8 oz
Whipping cream
240 g



1 oz
Chocolate (54-66% Cocoa mass)
30 g



2 teaspoon
Instant coffee
4 g



14 oz
Sweetened condensed milk
420 g



8 oz
Whiskey (smooth)
240 g









1 teaspoon
Vanilla extract
5 g









 
 
 



 
 
 



























































































































1 Bring heavy cream to a boil. Pour onto chocolate and coffee extract and blend smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk. Pour in Whiskey and vanilla. Allow to completely cool.
2.Make chocolate shells that will provide a flat surface when turned upside down. (no round domes!)
3. Spread couverture onto acetate and cut matching shapes which are slightly larger than mold. Once cut flip upside down and cover with heavy board to keep the cutouts perfectly flat. (Very important)
4. The remaining work is best done with 2 people: Dip the edge of each molded chocolate into tempered (on the warm side) couverture chocolate and fill immediately with liqueur (using a squeeze bottle is a good option). Quickly top with chocolate cutout.
Yields about 90-100 chocolates.

<title>Chestnut Crème Brûlée</title>
<description>

One of the most beautiful trees on earth is without a doubt the chestnut tree.  Sadly, in North America 4 billion chestnut trees were killed by fungus in the 1900’s, which is just one reason why chestnut desserts are hard to find on dessert menus.
Using fresh chestnuts is for many pastry chefs something which is too labor intensive. However, frozen I.Q.F. (individual quick frozen) chestnuts as well as chestnut puree is readily available.
The crème brûlée below is formulated using non sweetened chestnuts, if using sweetened puree reduce the sugar content in this recipe. When selecting fresh chestnuts ensure that the skin feels tight to the meat. Aromatize chestnut desserts with Vanilla, chestnut liquor or Cognac.
 
Chestnut Crème Brûlée
About 8 servings




5 oz
Peeled chestnuts
150 g



8 oz
Milk
240 g



1 oz
Chestnut liquor
30 g



2 teaspoon
Vanilla bean extract
10 g



pinch
Salt
pinch









7 oz
Egg yolk
210 g









7 oz
Light or medium brown sugar
210 g



18 oz
Heavy cream
540 g



4 oz
Candied chestnut pieces
120 g
















Combine peeled chestnuts with milk and blend to fine puree. Add liquor, vanilla and salt. Set aside.
In a bowl whisk yolks and brown sugar vigorously but without making the mixture light and airy. Add heavy cream and chestnut mixture.
Pour in ramekins and place on tray filled with water. Bake at 160°C (325°F) until crème brûlée no longer trembles, about 55 minutes. (Depending on height of ramekin).
Once cooled sprinkle surface with sugar and caramelize, decorate with candied chestnut pieces.

<title>Port Chocolate Pecan Tart</title>
<description>

A common criticism of pecan pie is that it can be sweet, too sweet in fact. However, it does not necessarily have to be that way. If you start by making pecan pie without high fructose corn syrup, you will automatically cut down the high levels of sweetness.  It is a common belief by many people that pecan pie can only be made with corn syrup.  However that is not true, it has been my experience that pecan pies made without corn syrup taste far superior.
For the pecan tart featured here, I decreased the sweetness level even further. Using smooth and good quality Port (Porto) made this possible.  Premium Port has complex flavor notes which harmonize excellent with pecans. Adding a small amount of chocolate enhances this complexity even more.

Whisk eggs and Port until combined. Add brown sugar and salt. Add melted butter and vanilla.
Chop half of pecans in small pieces and scatter onto bottom of tart pan. Scatter in chocolate.
Gently pour filling into tart pan about half full. Onto floating pecans pieces arrange pecan halves in a circular fashion starting on edges and working towards center.
In a drizzle fashion pour remaining filling over pecans. Try to cover each and every single pecan.
Place in 160°C (325°F) oven and bake until center is set. If center is rising the tart has slightly been over baked.

<title>Pumpkin Brownies</title>
<description>

The combination of pumpkin and chocolate may be unusual, however it is rather a delicious one. If you want to serve pumpkin brownies as a plated dessert, consider a mandarin sorbet. Oftentimes I am asked if I use fresh pumpkins instead of canned, but I do not. I prefer canned pumpkin as it provides consistent and very good results.
Since the pumpkin part of this brownie provides a good amount of creaminess, I choose a brownie batter formulated with cocoa powder as it creates a less fudgy brownie.

<title>Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse</title>
<description>

Chocolate mousse remains one of the most popular desserts in the world. Being so prevalent that chocolate mousse mixes are available everywhere and premade chocolate mousse can be found in the refrigerated section of many grocery stores. To differentiate your chocolate mousse, attention to detail and ingredients is very important. What I have found is that chocolate mousse made without egg white or yolk, renders a very nice and deep pronounced chocolate flavor. So much indeed that based on flavor alone it is one of my favorite methods of making chocolate mousse. The melting quality of this mousse is rather refined as well as it will not stick to spoons or knifes.
In school I have seen students obtaining great results using this method as it is a rather simple one. Chocolate mousse containing Italian meringue and or pate a Bombe naturally leave more room for error as there’re more ingredients to juggle.

<title>Opera | Green Tea</title>
<description>
 

It has been my experience that people, who appreciate the classic Opera entremet created by Gaston Lenôtre, are usually equally impressed with a green tea version. In this variation, everything remains as the original; it is only the coffee which is replaced with Matcha (green tea).
For the moistening process of the joconde biscuit, I do prefer to use a typical combination of 3 parts simple syrup and one part green tea liqueur. Green tea liqueur brings finesse and freshness to this cake. For the assembly refer to On Baking 3, on page 645, replacing coffee buttercream with green tea buttercream and replacing coffee moistening syrup with green tea syrup.

Green tea buttercream:
 




17 oz
French style buttercream
500 g



0.25 oz
Green tea powder (Matcha)
8 g




































































































Combine green tea powder in a very small amount of water to form a paste. Combine with buttercream.

<title>Figs in Port</title>
<description>

 
Figs cooked until semi tender in a Port reduction makes a light, elegant and very delicious dessert. Going further by adding a small amount of chocolate to the reduction, just enough to taste the complex flavor notes in both Port and chocolate is even more special. For certain cooking/baking applications decent Port will do, but when Port is used as the principal nucleus, it is a must to use the better type.
Very seldom will I suggest brands, but here it is important as the wrong Port will not create the dessert you are after. For this particular application I prefer a graceful Port, rich in flavor reminiscent of sweet red berries and ending with a fresh velvety finish. The 10 year old Tawny Porto by Croft will provide just that.
Besides Port, figs also love the company of a touch of spice, serving this dessert with Speculoos/ Speculaas cookies or speculoos gelato can be a brilliant combination.
Frequently (also as dessert) I serve this at home with a selection of aged cheese and artisan bread. In such case I do omit the chocolate.

Figs in Port | Figs in Porto
 




8  oz
Tawny Port (Croft)
240 g



1 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
30 g



0.10 oz
Bittersweet chocolate
10 g




























































































































Cut figs in half and set aside.
In a saucepan heat Port and sugar until nearly reduced.
Add figs, cut side down and cook on low-medium heat until figs are thoroughly heated and are “a dente”.
Place on a preheated serving plate and quickly reduce remaining port until it coats the back of a spoon. Swirl in chocolate and pour onto figs. Serve.

<title>Egg Free Ice Cream | Frangelico Ice cream</title>
<description>

In ice cream, egg yolks are used for their stabilizing ability as they bind water, resulting in frozen desserts with a rich mouth feel.  Large ice cream manufacturers often use gums in addition to, or instead of egg yolks. Gums allow hefty amounts of air incorporation during churning, increasing the volume of an ice cream base. Gums are also used to aid in the prevention of ice crystals formation in stored ice cream.
Although it may seem that eggs or gums are a positive ingredient in ice cream making, they do have a negative aspect. For example, egg yolk adds (unwanted) flavor to ice creams and gums, “coat” our taste buds. The “coating” makes it harder for our taste buds to fully experience flavor.  Also, ice creams made with gums will feel less cold, intense and vibrant in the mouth.
Preparing smooth, non icy and luxurious Ice cream without egg yolk and without stabilizers is possible. Good to know since millions of people cannot eat or are allergic to eggs. May I suggest you give this a try? Chances are that you will be amazed with the result.
 
Frangelico Ice Cream | Without Eggs
 




14 oz
Milk

         Bring milk, cream, brown sugar and salt to a full boil. Remove from heat and place in ice bath.
         When properly chilled add Frangelico and preferably place in a refrigerator overnight before churning.
         Churn according to ice cream manufacturer’s directions.

<title>Almond Petit Four |Lemon Macadamia</title>
<description>

Piped almond petit four are much appreciated by our clients and certainly belong in a luxurious assortment of petit four.  Sugar content in almond paste can vary therefore it is very important to use the right kind. Almond paste with high sugar content will result in petit four which will spread out too much during baking. For the petit four featured here use almond paste containing 63-67% almonds.
Lemon or orange zest can be added to further enhance the flavor of this delicious cookie. After baking and cooling, the petit four can be dipped in mild dark chocolate or milk chocolate. Remember that bitter chocolate can quickly overshadow the delicate almond flavor.

Almond Petit Four | Lemon Macadamia
 




10 oz
Almond paste (63-67% almonds)
300 g



4 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
120 g



1
Zest of lemon
1



2 oz
Egg whites
60 g



3 oz
Macadamia nuts
90 g


















































































Combine almond paste, sugar and lemon zest in bowl fitted with a paddle attachment.
Add a very small amount of egg white and blend until smooth and no lumps remain. Add another small amount of egg whites and blend smooth. Adding egg whites too fast will result in a lumpy paste.
Continue with egg whites until a firm yet pipeable paste is obtained, depending on initial consistency of almond paste not all egg whites may be needed. However, it is also possible that more egg white is required.
Pipe on buttered parchment or silicone mats. Decorate with a few macadamia nut pieces. Allow to crust for 1 hour before baking.
Bake at 400°F (200°C) until light golden.

<title>Tiramisu | Speculoos</title>
<description>

 
 
Mascarpone cream/mousse is very delicious when combined with the complex flavor of speculoos (speculaas). For desserts which nod to Tiramisu, I make ladyfingers containing speculoos spices. Not necessarily a true authentic way of making tiramisu, but delicious nonetheless.
On speculoos / speculaas, recently several books have published recipes for these cookies containing nothing more than cinnamon as the only spice. Authentic speculoos is much more complex and much more delicious when made with a true speculoos spice blend. I suggest you to try the spice blend below in your own speculoos recipe. In On Baking 3, a good recipe for speculoos cookies is found on page 341.
Assembly 
1. Prepare ladyfingers
2. Prepare moistening syrup, when cooled moisten ladyfinger cake and place in glasses /rings/molds
3. Prepare mascarpone cream and fill glasses alternating with moistened ladyfinger cake.
4. Decorate with speculoos cookies/chocolate/sugared and toasted almonds and cocoa powder

Place gelatin leaves in very cold water and set aside.
In a cold bowl whisk heavy cream to very soft ribbon consistency. Absolutely do not whip to a peak! Set aside.
Fill a saucepan with a small amount of water and bring to a boil and then turn to a low simmer.  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks and measured water. Add sugar and whisk well. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the yolk mixture reaches at least 165°F (74°C). Remove from heat.
Remove the gelatin leaves from the water and squeeze well to remove excess water. Whisk the gelatin into the yolk mixture. Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and whisk smooth.
Add the soft whipped heavy cream and gently fold into the above using a spatula. Fill into the mold immediately.

<title>Nougatine</title>
<description>
 
 
 

 
Nougatine slivers fit perfectly in a high end selection of chocolates and when properly made have a good shelf life, which is another reason, why they are a great addition in a Chocolatiers repertoire. For enthusiastic pastry students*, nougatine is an excellent skill builder. After all chances are you will be making nougatine to include it in ice creams, entremet, showpieces, plated dessert decorations…  I suggest you give it a go!

*Preparing caramel as described here is not easy, especially if you are new to this. Therefore before adding (expensive) almonds, make sure that the caramel is golden-amber and is non grainy.  This type of caramel made without water has a deeper and more delicious caramel flavor compared to caramel made with sugar, water and glucose or corn syrup.

Nougatine




4 oz
Invert sugar
120 g



1 lb 2 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
540 g



8 oz
Toasted almonds
240 g



1 tsp
Vanilla bean seeds
4 g









1.5 oz
Unsalted butter
40 g



pinch
Fleur de sel
Pinch



Optional: Candied orange peel

Set aside a silpat and a rolling pin. If using a wooden rolling pin, butter it lightly. Not necessary if using a silicone rolling pin. Preheat  oven to 300°F (150°C)
In a saucepan bring invert sugar to a boil, add a few tablespoons of the listed sugar and stir to melt sugar (Do not allow to caramelize at this point). Add a few more tablespoons of sugar and stir until melted again. Continue with slowly adding larger amounts of sugar. Do not vigorously stir at any point.
Cook to a golden-amber caramel stirring gently. Remove from heat (If you do not have a perfect non grainy caramel at this point, do not waste almonds. Simply throw it out and do it again), immediately add butter, vanilla, salt followed by toasted almonds. Stir to combine with a heat resistant or wooden spatula.
 Scrape the nougatine onto the silpat. Let sit for a few moments and then start gently rolling the nougatine into a thin sheet about the thickness of 3 stacked credit cards.
If the nougatine hardens before it is sufficiently thin, keep it on the silpat and place it in the oven to slowly soften. Press with a finger to check if it is soft enough and then roll once more.
When cooled break nougatine into organic shapes.  Place a piece of candied orange peel on the surface if desired.
Dip into tempered chocolate of choice (I do recommend a non bitter dark chocolate as bitter chocolate quickly overtakes the caramel and almond flavor notes).

<title>Spritz | Eddy Van Damme</title>
<description>

It is easy to see why so many people appreciate Sablés Viennois or Spritz, they are attractive and people like the sandy buttery texture of these simple, yet sophisticated petit four.  Whether served with espresso, tea or gelato they always prove to be a hit.
A few things are important to ensure a gorgeous baked product. One is the type of flour, if it is too weak in protein the batter may spread too much in the oven resulting in a product without clear marks on the surface.  Therefore I recommend using good quality pastry flour. Second, do not over cream butter as this will create too much spreading of the product in the oven. Resulting in lost surface marks as well.
Baking is best done in a deck using ample bottom heat to ensure that jam will not stick to silpat when petit four are removed. If using a convection oven I recommend using a thinly made baking tray or perforated baking tray.

Sablés Viennois | Spritz
 










1 lb 2.5 oz
Butter, at room temperature
560 g



8.5 oz
Powdered sugar
250 g

<title>Pistachio Ice Cream</title>
<description>
 
 
 

One of the most luxurious ice cream or gelato is without a doubt pistachio. Irresistible when combined with chocolate, strawberries, apricots ….
You certainly can turn this into gelato and replace whipping cream with an equal amount of milk. Doing so will bring out a more pronounced pistachio flavor but the reduction of fat will in turn decrease   conservation. (Not a problem if consumed say day as it was churned) Either way, use the amount of pistachios as indicated in this recipe to obtain a most wonderful texture and flavor.
 
Pistachio Ice Cream |Pistachio Gelato
 




1 lb 1 oz
Milk
500 g



6 oz
Whipping cream
180 g



1.75 oz
Non fat milk powder
50 g



4.5 oz + 2 oz
Pistachios (non salted)
135 g + 60 g



2 oz
Invert sugar
60 g









2.5 oz + 2 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
75+ 60 g









0.2 oz
Ice cream stabilizer (optional)*
5 g



3 oz
Egg yolk
90 g















 
 

















































































































Bring milk, cream, milk powder, pistachios (135 g-4.5 oz), invert sugar and 75 g (2.5 oz) sugar to boil.
Whisk 60 g (2 oz) granulated sugar and ice cream stabilizer *(if using) together and whisk rapidly in yolks until doubled in volume.
Pour 250 ml (8 oz) of boiled mixture into yolks and whisk smooth.  Pour tempered yolk mixture into remaining cream, on low heat and while constantly stirring using a rubber spatula heat to 83°C (183°F).
Remove from heat. Pour mixture into a blender (pacotize) and mix until pistachios are superfine and green color is obtained.
Chill immediately in ice bath. Cover and chill overnight in refrigerator.
Lightly toast remaining pistachios in oven. Chop in medium pieces and place in freezer.
Following day churn in pre-chilled ice cream machine.  When ice cream is churned add frozen and chopped pistachios.
Use as desired.

<title>Pistachio Chocolates</title>
<description>

In many assortments of chocolates, the pistachio variety can be one of the most eye catching, indeed, bright green pistachios on chocolate is a very striking look.  The filling of pistachio chocolates can be approached in different ways.  Using almond paste as a base, which is further enhanced with pistachio paste and other ingredients is popular and delicious resulting is a texture similar as marzipan. However, not all countries in the world are fond of this particular texture and therefore another approach of pistachio chocolates may have to be used.  Regardless of how you make fillings for chocolates, important to remember is that pistachio flavor can easily be lost in ganache made of bitter dark chocolate.

The pistachio chocolates recipe featured here is made using cream, pistachios, white chocolate and Dumante pistachio liqueur.  Instead of pistachios a good quality unsweetened pure pistachio paste can also be used.  Adding aromatized pistachio paste is an option if yet a stronger pistachio flavor is desired. The pistachio chocolates featured on the photos are made without green food color, if a greener color is desired add coloring after adding Dumante pistachio liqueur.

225 g
Pistachios (non salted)
7.5 oz



pinch
Fleur de sel
Pinch



60 g
Invert sugar
2 oz



700 g
White chocolate, small pieces
24 oz









60 g
Dumante pistachio Liqueur
2 oz









As needed
Semis sweet chocolate for enrobing
As needed




























In a saucepan bring to boil cream, pistachios, fleur de sel and invert sugar.  Remove from heat and pour into a well made blender. Mix until very smooth paste is obtained. Add Dumante pistachio liqueur.
Remove from blender and stir in chocolate. If part of chocolate refuses to melt completely, place bowl for 5-10 seconds at a time in microwave oven.
Pour pistachio ganache between confectionary rulers.
Allow crystallizing for 18-24 hours slightly below 20°C (70°F).  Do NOT refrigerate at this stage as doing so will encourage mold and bacteria growth. (W hen ganache is removed from a refrigerator condensation will form on the surface, the condensation will be trapped when ganache is dipped in tempered chocolate. It is exactly in that area where mold and bacteria start to grow.)
Cut in desired size and enrobe in tempered dark chocolate. Decorate with pistachios.

<title>Gianduja Cremeux</title>
<description>

Gianduja certainly belongs in a collection of good quality chocolates and can equally be effective in many desserts. It pairs very well with a vast amount of flavors which makes it very appealing for us in the pastry atelier. Flavors such as coffee, passion fruit, citrus, chocolate, certain peppers are prime candidates for pairing.
This Gianduja cremeux can also be made with an in house version of Gianduja as I show here .  If using the in house version you will have to slightly increase the gelatin amount. However may I recommend keeping the gelatin amount low to retain a very silky and tender textured cremeux?

Gianduja Cremeux:
 




17 oz
Heavy cream
500 g



17 oz
Milk
500 g



3.5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
100 g



6 oz
Egg yolk
180 g



pinch
salt
pinch



3
Gelatin sheets/leaves
3



16 oz
Milk chocolate Gianduja, chopped
470 g









4 oz
Frangelico liqueur
120 g


























































Place gelatin sheets in ice water and set aside.
Bring cream and milk to boil. Meanwhile whisk yolks and sugar to ribbon consistency. Add one fourth of boiling mixture to yolks and whisk rapidly.
Pour tempered yolks to remaining boiled cream and heat gently while constantly stirring using a rubber spatula to 82°C (183°F).
Remove from heat, press gelatin sheets and whisk into the mixture.  Whisk in Gianduja. Add Frangelico.
At this stage the mixture may look foamy and it is best to set into an ice bath stirring occasionally. This will slowly erase the foamy layer and allow a beautiful surface when poured in verrines.
If using cake or dacquoise in the verrine, pre-chilling the cremeux will prevent these from floating to the surface. “Gluing” these down with chocolate is also effective.
Pour in verrines, cover with plastic food wrap and place in refrigerator. Setting will take 4 hours and complete setting will take 15 hours.
Decorate with lime marshmallow as shown on my site here and chocolate caramel tuile.

<title>Frangelico in desserts</title>
<description>

Frangelico with its deep rich aroma of hazelnuts can bring finesse to a variety of desserts. Pairing can successfully be done with grapefruit and other citrus, chocolate, coffee and several other ingredients. Mascarpone cheese is another product which makes a great combination with Frangelico. This dessert certainly winks to tiramisu although it does not contain coffee, in fact the genoise is moistened in Frangelico syrup. We in the profession know that our customers do like Tiramisu-esque desserts and therefore this one may be a good dessert for serving a large gathering of people (Hotel-Country Club events…).
Our friends at PCB creation http://www.pcb-creation.fr/ have a great amount of pastry specialty items to give desserts a special flair. The mascarpone cream featured here was poured on one of their structure sheets named matlelassees.  When using such sheets ensure that your products are well frozen before removing the structure sheets to obtain a clean look. As a side, note one of the greatest North American interior designers John Saladino often uses matelassee fabric in his interior designs and the House of Chanel uses matelasee pattern on watches and more.  How close indeed the world of patisserie is connected to the world of design.

<title>Raspberry Mint Sorbet</title>
<description>

Simple desserts do not necessarily translate into boring. A minimal composition of raspberry mint sorbet sandwiched between thin sheets of cocoa nib topped chocolate is an example of such.
For most sorbets I recommend a combination of sugars such as invert sugar, glucose and granulated sugar. Invert sugar and glucose along with pectin (or other stabilizing product) will control crystallization and provide a smoother product with a very good mouth feel.  Stabilizers are especially helpful when sorbet is stored in freezers which do not maintain a steady temperature.

 
Raspberry Mint Sorbet
 










15 oz
Water
450 g



7 oz
Granulated sugar
210 g



0.33 oz
Apple pectin
10 g



4 oz
glucose
120 g



1oz
Invert sugar
30 g









0.33 oz
Mint extract
10 g









2 lb 3 oz
Raspberry puree
1000 g



























 

Pour water in saucepan. Thoroughly combine granulated sugar with pectin. Add to water, add glucose. Whisk to boil.
Allow to cool and preferably allow maturing for 4 hours (or several days) in a refrigerator before adding fruit puree.
Add invert sugar, mint extract and fruit puree.
Churn in ice cream machine. If working with a semi commercial ice cream machine ensure that the machine is not over filled, that it has been well pre-chilled and that the sorbet mixture is very cold when adding to machine.  This will ensure fast churning and thus resulting in a very smooth texture. (The longer the sorbet is being churned the larger the ice crystals will be)

<title>Noble Chocolate Cream</title>
<description>

Noble chocolate cream is a cousin of chocolate cremeux but made without egg yolk. Another difference is that it contains higher amount of milk than whipping cream, this allows the chocolate flavor to be fully pronounced. (High fat content has a tendency to masks flavors) Since no eggs are present and a smaller amount of cream is used, the gelatin is slightly increased. However this cream is not firm or gelatinous, instead it is silky, luxurious and superbly creamy without carrying an overly rich feeling.
For this cream I recommend using chocolate with cocoa mass content in the mid 50 range with a deep and well pronounced chocolate flavor.
For our Patisserie student readers: A higher amount of cocoamass does not necessarily equal a stronger chocolate flavor. Chocolate flavor intensity will rely on several factors such as the cocoa butter content, roasting of the beans and more. (Think of coffee beans, one brand will make rich tasting coffee while another brand will be mild).
Since this cream does not contain eggs or cream which is whipped, it is a prime candidate to compare chocolate brands and how well they perform  in terms of residual chocolate flavor.  Use different brands of chocolate containing identical cocoa mass may reveal surprising results. Often, what is superior in terms of tasting it as pure chocolate may leave a less pronounced flavor as a finished product.
Note: If the Noble cream develops a firmer set than desired, reduce the amount of gelatin. Not all chocolate will result in the the same setting.

<title>Petit Four Sec</title>
<description>

Many grocery stores in the world carry machine made cookies/petit four/biscuits which are made with pure butter, good quality chocolate and natural ingredients. This certainly makes it more challenging for us in the pastry lab to produce these products which surpasses the competition. One advantage we have is that many of our cookies/petit four can easily be adjusted to the seasons or specific holidays. A second benefit is that we can use ingredients which have a rather short shelf life which the giant manufacturers cannot.  Another plus is that some cookies are only amazing the day they were made. Take for example a chocolate chip cookie, highly desired when they are soft and chewy which can only be produced by a bakery/Patisserie/home. Interesting about these cookies is that in many parts of the world these are baked to a crisp state. In the United States, the crisp version of chocolate chip cookies are primarily made by the giants and packaged.
 
Petit Four

















































































































Roll chilled coconut shortbread* 2.5 mm (1/8 inch) thick. Cut into circles and bake at 180°C (375°F)) until blond in color- not golden brown.
Using a small star tip pipe a border of almond macaronade* on the edge.
Return to same degree oven and bake until golden color. If needed use a double baking sheet to prevent excess browning of the bottom.
Once cooled place a slice of candied kumquat in each petit four.
Fill with crystallized milk chocolate or low cocoamass dark chocolate. (Or a blend of the two)

<title>Mendiants</title>
<description>

Of all the chocolates Mendiants are one of the easiest and fastest to make and are very much appreciated by our clients. Traditionally they are made with dark chocolate and a variety of nuts and candied fruits but the ones featured here are made with Valentines in mind.
Since many of our customers are not excited about white chocolate you may decide to add some additional flavoring to enhance it to your standards. For these I added vanilla bean to the white chocolate as it blends very well with the freeze dried strawberries, dried cherries, cranberries and macadamia nut.
Freeze dried strawberries will get soft when exposed to a refrigerator or high humidity. Packaging these is recommended.

<title>Chocolate mousse</title>
<description>

When we think about Valentine’s Day the heart is what primarily comes to mind. For many years the only device we had to create a heart, was a heart shape cutter. Things have changed for the better and now we have access to 3 dimensional heart shaped Flexipan. Pastry Chefs the world over, like to use these since they facilitate beautiful desserts, in quick and hygienic ways with unsurpassed results.
The possibilities are endless, whether you want to mould a lemon-passion fruit cream as shown on my site here, a Bavarian, a mousse etc.  Working Pâtissiers already know, but for the enthusiastic pastry students out there, it is important to remember that when making mousses and creams for Flexipan to keep the following in mind. If your recipe has temperature guidelines follow these strictly and make certain that the whipping cream is only whipped to a very soft consistency.  Of course these rules apply anytime, however to ensure a beautiful molded mousse or cream using Flexipan, make certain the recipe was correctly performed and this way you truly will obtain unrivaled products.  The chocolate mousse recipe below works tremendously well in Flexipan and I highly recommend you give it a try. The texture and flavor of the chocolate mousse will not disappoint.  If desired serve the chocolate mousse with raspberry sorbet and caramel tuile as featured in the picture.

Chocolate mousse
 




13 oz
Milk
390 g



3
Gelatin sheets, bloomed

1.Whip the whipping cream to very soft consistency. (Thick but slightly pourable)
2.Bring the milk to a boil and remove from heat. Allow to cool for 2 minutes. Remove gelatin from water and press to remove excess water. Whisk into the hot milk.
3.Pour half of the milk-gelatin mixture into the chocolate and whisk well. Gradually add the remaining milk and whisk until smooth.
4.Allow the mixture to cool down (or bring to) to (110°F) 43°C and add all the whipped cream at once. Using a rubber spatula fold gently until combined.
5.Pour into the Flexipan and place in freezer overnight.

<title>Tuiles</title>
<description>

We all know that many plated desserts can go from ordinary to extraordinary by simply adding an eye catching tuile. It is the reason why so many of us use them in our work on a daily basis. Made round, square, into long strips, curved, left flat, rolled, the possibilities are nearly endless. Besides being placed on a plated dessert they also fit perfectly on a petit four platter and can be delicious when dipped in chocolate.
Tuiles suffer quickly when exposed to humidity and are therefore best made daily or packaged air tight with desiccant.  Personally, for even results I prefer to make tuiles using Flexipan since it allows for efficient work with excellent results.  Certainly Silpat can be used as well.
The recipe below is composed of lime and grapefruit juice but these juices can be replaced with passion fruit. Some tuiles can be a greasy upon removal from the oven but these are well balanced and do not require pectin or glucose. For the students out there, tuiles need to be scaled exact to ensure a lacy texture.
 

Tuiles Recipe










2 oz
Butter, room temperature
60 g



5 oz
Powdered (Confectioners) sugar
150 g



pinch
Salt
2 g



1 oz
Lime juice
30 g



1 oz
Grapefruit juice
30 g









1.33 oz
Pasty/all purpose flour
40 g


























 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 




Cream the butter and add powdered sugar and salt. Cream until light.
Gradually add the fruit juices.
Blend in the flour. Allow to mature for 1 hour before baking or overnight in a refrigerator.
Pipe small amount s of the batter into Flexipan or onto Silpat. If desired place a slice of candied kumquat onto the batter and bake in a 350°F (180°C) oven until light golden.
For shaped tuiles remove from the pan and shape into desired forms. For flat tuiles allow to cool in pan.
Once cooled store airtight with a desiccant.

<title>Candied kumquats</title>
<description>

Kumquats are some of the quickest and least complicated fruits to candy. From start to finish, semi candied kumquats can be achieved within 40 minutes.  A drastic time difference compared to the preparation of candied orange peels which are blanched several times to remove bitterness from the peel and are then followed by an extensive candying process.
Semi candied kumquats are well liked by our customers, therefore if you have desserts which you want to enhance with an orange-citrus component, they can be an excellent choice. Think about adding semi candied kumquats to gelato, layered in entremets, yogurt desserts, in cheesecake, in ganache etc.

 
Semi candied Kumquats | Semi Candied Cumquats




17 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
500 g



17 oz
Water
500 g



8 oz
Glucose
240 g



12 oz
kumquats
360 g
























































































In a non reactive saucepan bring to a boil the sugar, water and glucose.
Slice the kumquats crosswise in 2 mm thick slices.
Add the sliced kumquats to the boiling syrup and turn to simmer.
Simmer on low for approximately 30 minutes or until tender.
Allow to cool and store in a refrigerator.

<title>Pâte à Choux with Streusel</title>
<description>

Pâte à Choux topped with streusel or crumble has some real advantages.  One, a smooth rounded surface on profiteroles or éclairs is easily obtained. Two, the added flavor and texture of streusel is a welcoming factor to the rather bland flavor of Pâte à Choux. Three, profiteroles or éclairs expand much larger and more uniformly compared to choux paste which is not topped with streusel. Four, the interior of the choux paste products is visibly more hollow.

For us in the baking industry having éclairs or profiteroles crack in the oven is disappointing and therefore I bake choux paste at rather low oven temperatures. Using flour with fairly high protein content allows for extra eggs in the batter, which in turn permits lower oven temperatures but with good expansion of the products.  Adding a small amount of steam in the oven as soon as the pate a choux is loaded in the oven also helps very well with the prevention of cracks.
Photo below: Profiteroles piped the same size, baked on same tray. The one topped with streusel expands visibly larger.

Place the mixture into a bowl fitted with the paddle attachment, on medium speed gradually add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bowl often. Once 14 oz (420 g) of the eggs are added examine the batter, it should be smooth and have a light sheen. It should be firm enough to hold its shape when piped. Add the remaining egg if needed.
Pipe the batter using a plain tip on parchment lined sheet pans.
Cut the streusel in circles 10% smaller than the piped pate a choux and place on the surface.
Place in a (lightly steam injected) oven at 350°F (180°C) with steam vent closed. When the products are well expanded, open the steam vent (or part oven door) to let the steam escape. Bake until the products are crisp when pressed on the sides. About 27-33 minutes for profiteroles.

<title>Hazelnut & Orange Chocolate Bar</title>
<description>
 

After talking to countless Pastry chefs and Chocolatiers who are in search of fillings for chocolates with an extended shelf life, I thought it was time to highlight such filling which may be of use to you.  This particular filling contains nougatine which adds a layer of complexity, but the good news is that the nougatine is chopped and therefore rolling it to a thickness of 2 stacked bank cards is not a total necessity.  Although on the picture this particular filling is piped into a chocolate bar mold, any shallow type of chocolate mold should work.  The filling tilts on the sweet side and therefore I do recommend to use shallow chocolate mold as the flavor balance between the chocolate and the filling will then be optimal. For the molding process I recommend a semi sweet chocolate couverture with a cocoa mass content of 52-58% maximum. Milk chocolate mixed with dark chocolate can also work well and be equally delicious. Using ¾ milk chocolate couverture combined with ¼ dark chocolate couverture will provide good balance. Using bitter chocolate for the molding process will make it hard to properly experience the hazelnut flavor which we all know is a rather expensive ingredient not to be noticed.

<title>Gianduja</title>
<description>
 

Gianduja is a highly desired filling for chocolates as it is both delicious and luxurious. Many recipes and methods to prepare Gianduja exist but all contain similar ingredients. These mainly include hazelnuts, sugar and chocolate and at times with lesser amounts, milk powder and cocoa butter. Some of us in the pastry lab also make Gianduja using part hazelnuts and part almonds. To make a silky smooth Gianduja a roller refiner machine is necessary; however a good quality food processor can provide good results as well. The recipe for Gianduja below is made using purchased hazelnut paste, for a recipe using raw hazelnuts see my recipe here on my site.



Chocolates which are made using pure Gianduja (Thus no fillings which contain Gianduja but also include butter, cream, fruit purees etc) can be kept for a much longer time if compared to standard ganache. The extended shelf life is attributed to a very low Aw value of chocolate and hazelnut paste, the main components. Ganache an emulsion of chocolate and cream (which contains a large amount of water) has a high Aw value. Remember, generally speaking the higher the Aw value of chocolate fillings the shorter its shelf life will be. Fillings with high Aw values are perfect breeding grounds for micro organisms. Certainly there is more than the Aw value which determine shelf life, but for chocolates made in high sanitary conditions and using the correct working methods the Aw value is a very important one. In upcoming work I will go deeper into this subject.
When using Gianduja in chocolates it is important to remember that the delicate flavor of hazelnuts can easily be lost. Using chocolate with a cocoa mass content of 60% or higher will make it harder for your consumers to fully appreciate the wonderful Gianduja flavor.
Gianduja Chocolates with Dried Cranberries




17 oz
Hazelnut paste, sweetened
500 g



7 oz
Milk chocolate (38-42% cocoa)
210 g



3 oz
Dried Cranberries
90 g



For enrobing, as needed
Semisweet chocolate 52-58%
For enrobing, as needed
























































































 This Gianduja can be made and poured between candy rulers or can be left to crystallize and then rolled between thick plastic to desired thickness. The chocolates featured here were made using a frame which allows the creation of an uneven surface.
 Using candy rulers create a frame of approximately 12 x 12 inch (30 x 30 cm) onto a silpat. Set aside.
 For fast setting of the Gianduja temper the chocolate and mix with room temperature hazelnut paste followed by cranberries.
 Pour into the frame and even out using an offset spatula. If not using a frame allow the Gianduja to set in the bowl, stirring every few minutes for even cooling. Once crystallized remove from bowl and roll to desired thickness between plastic sheets.
After several hours or overnight (do not refrigerate) cut into desired size.
Temper dark chocolate couverture and enrobe the Gianduja centers. “Mark” the surface using your dipping fork.

<title>Chocolate Mints</title>
<description>

There is something to be said to have chocolates in your repertoire which hold a long shelf life. It can make your work schedule a lot easier since you can make these types of chocolates well in advance of busy holidays.   One type of filling which will certainly keep fresh for at least 6 months is a Confiserie fondant type. Often used in economy chocolate selections since it is an inexpensive type of filling with the additional benefit of long conservation.  They are frequently flavored with liquors and or flavoring compounds to mask its sweetness and of course to give flavor.  Using chocolate with higher cocoa mass content is another way to balance the high sugariness.  Fondant type of fillings tend to work best in rather low depth chocolate molds where it is easier to achieve a good balance between the sweet filling and bittersweet chocolate.
Confiserie fondant mixed with peppermint oil is a classic and well liked in many parts of our world.  The cooling sensation of peppermint combined with good bittersweet chocolate is a delicious pleasure indeed.  Few of us make our own confiserie fondant but for our pastry students who cannot readily purchase this fondant you can find the recipe on my site here.

Mint Chocolates




17 oz
Confiserie fondant
500 g



As needed
Peppermint oil or extract
As needed



Optional
Mint liquor
optional



As needed
Bittersweet chocolate 58-65%
As needed
























































































 Line chocolate molds with tempered chocolate and place upside down in a refrigerator until the chocolate starts to contract.
 Warm fondant in a microwave oven to 85F (cccccccccc) add peppermint oil or extract to taste. Add a very small amount of water or liquor to bring to a thick but pipeable consistency.  Keep well covered to prevent a skin from forming.
 Fill the molds 2 mm from edge.  If desired sprinkle with cocoa nibs. Allow the fondant to “crust”.
 Cover with tempered chocolate and place in the refrigerator.
 Unmold.

<title>Ginger Ice Cream</title>
<description>
 

 
Although ginger is used in the savory kitchen year round, it seems that most of us in the pastry kitchen (especially in the West) use it mainly during the fall and winter season.  One of the things that I like about ginger is that it can be very effective in creating an aura of excellence to desserts. Another reason is that ginger does wonders for the digestion system, which makes it a natural good choice for desserts. Ginger pairs very well with citrus and candied kumquat or candied orange peel are very good choices to incorporate into this ice cream dessert.
Once the ice cream is churned spread it into pre-chilled molds or rectangular mousse frames and layer with candied citrus and broken nougatine pieces. Allow to freeze 12 hours before unmolding and decorating.

 Bring the milk and cream to a boil. Remove from heat and add the ginger. Cover and infuse for 45 minutes.
 Return to heat source and heat to approximately 200°F (93°C). In a separate bowl whisk the yolks, sugar, honey and salt until thick and pale. Temper with 1/8 of the milk mixture, whisk well and add to the heated above. Using a rubber spatula stir constantly until a thermometer reaches 183°F (83°C).
 Remove from heat and pour in a chinois.
 Cover and place in an ice bath. When properly chilled place in a refrigerator overnight before churning.

<title>Peppermint Panna Cotta with Cranberry Coulis</title>
<description>

All of us in the Patisserie world know very well that during the busy Holiday season, having a quick to prepare winter dessert in your collection never hurts. This one does not disappoint and is very well liked. The combination of peppermint and cranberry is contemporary and the flavors work in perfect harmony.
In this dessert and some others, I prefer to use mint extract or mint essential oil over steeping fresh mint leaves. A good extract provides clean and fresh notes which are hard to achieve when using fresh leaves. Most often, brewed mint leaves exude grassy herbal notes which are not desired.

<title>Pumpkin Cheesecake</title>
<description>

 
Not every country in the world is fond of pumpkin desserts but for the places which do, pumpkin cheesecake is a welcoming finish to a good meal. A nice thing about using pumpkin in cheesecake is that pumpkin makes this dessert lighter in fat calories, enhances the creaminess and makes the dessert very fitting for the fall season.  For any type of cheesecake I recommend baking the crust separate and placing the baked and cooled cheesecake onto the baked crust. This prevents a disappointing bottom.  The flavor profile of this cheesecake works very well if placed on prebaked gingersnap crumbles or speculaas (speculoos).

 
Pumpkin Cheesecake
About 30 individual servings




3 lb
Cream cheese (Philadelphia)
1440 g



1 lb 8 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
720 g



8
Large eggs
8



2 teaspoon
Vanilla extract
10 g



¼ teaspoon
Salt
1 g









2 tbps
Orange zest
6 g









1 Tbsp
Cinnamon (Vietnamese Cassia)
6 g



2 tsp
Ginger, dried
4 g



1 lb 14 oz
Pumpkin puree, cooked
900 g














































 Allow the cream cheese to come at room temperature for easy blending.
 Combine the cream cheese and the sugar on low speed until smooth and no lumps remain. Scrape well.
 Add eggs one at a time waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated before adding next. Scrape often in between.
 Add all the flavorings and the pumpkin puree.
 Brush rings lightly with oil and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Wrap two sheets of aluminum foil underneath each ring and place in a roasting pan or a pan with high edges. Fill the rings with the batter.
 Pour water into the roasting pan to create a Bain Marie, about ½ inch (2 cm) of water surrounding the rings.
 Place in a 325°F (160°C) oven and bake until the center is set and no longer trembles, about 43 minutes.
 Allow to cool for several hours in the refrigerator before removing from the ring.
 If desired spray with cocoa butter and decorate as desired.

<title>Corn Syrup Free Pecan Pie</title>
<description>

For some time now I have wanted to write another article on pecan pie which is one of the most beloved desserts in the United States. Just like brownies it is a dessert which is gaining popularity worldwide. In America, many of our customers believe that pecan pies have to be made with corn syrup, not knowing that the original pecan pies were actually made with brown sugar. In the early 20th century less expensive corn syrup started to replace brown sugar and became the custom for pecan pies.
Several years ago, I started working on a corn syrup free pecan pie recipe because I felt that corn syrup versions were too sweet and the flavor was never “clear”. Since then I have been making pecan pies with brown sugar with excellent results and an unsurpassed flavor which I believe will be loved by your customers as well.

Although this recipe works perfect as is, for this particular pecan pie I have added some dark chocolate which further cuts the sweetness.  Pecans do like the company of Dark Rum, Cognac or Brandy and I do recommend adding some.  Most often pecan pies are made using standard pie dough (pâte brisée) but there is something to be said for using sweet tart dough (pate sucrée) instead. A prebaked sweet tart dough shell ensures a well baked crust which can be hard to achieve when using standard pie dough and rack ovens.
 
Pecan pie without corn syrup
Yield: 2 – 9 inch pies










 










6
Large eggs
6



12 oz
Water
240 g



1 lb 12 oz
Medium brown sugar
840 g


 
1 tsp
Salt
5 g



4 oz
Butter, melted
120 g









1 oz
Dark Rum, Cognac or Brandy
30 g



1 tbsp
Vanilla extract
15 g



1 lb
Pecan halves
480 g














 
4 oz
Chocolate (58-64% cocoa   mass)
120 g


 
 
 
 



 

Line 2 pie tins with sweet tart dough and prebake. Alternatively use pie dough (pâte brisée) and do not prebake.
Whisk together the eggs and water until smooth. Add brown sugar, salt, butter, liquor and vanilla extract.
Chop less than half of the pecans in small pieces and scatter in the pie shells along with the chocolate.  Fill with the filling about half full. The pecan pieces will automatically float.
Arrange the pecan halves in a circular fashion above the floating pecan pieces.
Carefully drizzle the remaining filling over the pecan halves.
For a pie made with sweet tart dough place in a 325°F (160°C) oven and bake until the center is set, about 65 minutes total. For pies made with standard pie dough place the pies in a 400°F (200°C) oven for 10 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C), bake until the center is set.

<title>Gateau Opera</title>
<description>

Few desserts possess an air of luxury as much as the gateau Opéra does.  A true classic which combines some of the most refined flavors we have on earth: coffee, chocolate and almonds. Our customers respond to it very well as these flavors are enjoyed by nearly everyone
Opéra is rather rich and a small piece is usually sufficient. On occasion, I have served Opera along chocolate sorbet to cut the richness somewhat, but in all honesty, Opera is pure perfection and just delicious by itself.
One of the great attributes of Opera is that it not only freezes very well, but it also is easily made into an entremet to be sold in a patisserie, cut for a plated dessert or served as a petit four.  On an entremet, oftentimes the word Opera is written but for smaller servings one can use his/her imagination.
For a plated version of the opéra I find nougatine a very effective decoration and a further enhancement to this delicious dessert.

 
The recipe for Opéra can be found in On Baking on page 661.

<title>Black Rice Cream</title>
<description>

In many parts of the world desserts made with rice have been popular for centuries and are often made into home style versions. Milk, sugar, cinnamon sticks, vanilla bean and rice is cooked until the rice is tender and the mixture has turned into a creamy consistency.  Nothing particularly wrong with that, but most of us need to be a little more creative to entice today’s consumer.
Some people dislike the typical mouth feel of rice desserts but this can easily be manipulated. For instance, in the dessert featured here whipped cream is folded in, which quickly transforms a thick and heavy texture to a lighter and creamy one. Adding fruit to rice desserts works extraordinarily well to further enhance the overall eating sensation.  Many types of fruit work very well with rice desserts, from sweet to slightly tart.
Not everyone is familiar with black rice therefore I like to share that black rice is not necessarily better tasting compared to white rice. However it is indeed eye catching. Black rice takes a very long time to become tender but it does provide the rice cream a rather nice lavender hue. Certainly this dessert can easily be made with short grain rice which will make the cooking time much shorter.

Coconut Black Rice Cream
Yield: 6-8 servings
 




1 quart  3 oz
Homemade coconut milk
1 lit



6 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
180 g



1
Vanilla bean, split
1



pinch
Salt
pinch



6 oz
Black rice (forbidden rice)
180 g









12 oz
Whipping cream
360 g











 


























































 Combine the homemade coconut milk, sugar, split vanilla bean, salt and black rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
 Cover and simmer on very low heat until the rice is tender, about 2 hours. If necessary add a small amount of milk to keep the mixture properly hydrated.
 Remove from heat and allow to cool.
 Whip the whipping cream to very soft peaks. Before folding the cream into the rice ensure that the rice mixture is creamy and will allow for easy folding in of the cream. If necessary add a small amount of milk.
 Pour into glasses and place in a refrigerator. Once cold decorate as desired.  This dessert is served with Mango-passion fruit coulis.

<title>Homemade Coconut Milk</title>
<description>

It is not easy to find good quality coconut milk which provides consistent results and has an excellent coconut flavor.  Some canned coconut milks are very fatty or thick, others are very liquid without much flavor. Coconut milk can also be prohibitive expensive for use in coconut cream pies or other common preparations.  Our vendors do sell coconut extract, which some is natural and some artificial, however most extracts make me think of sun tan lotion rather than real coconut.
Making your own coconut milk is very easy and provides a natural flavor. Standard dairy milk is what I usually use, but for specialty diets, soy, almond, flax seed milk and others will work just the same. If you need whipping cream with a coconut flavor use the same method as the recipe below. Although a fuller flavor will be obtained when using regular milk versus a high fat containing cream. For a toasted coconut flavor in your gelato, panna cotta, ice creams etc, simply toast the coconut first.
Since coconut is sold in many versions in the world and to prevent confusion, the coconut to look for is what most of us already have in our pastry lab: Unsweetened desiccated or unsweetened finely shredded coconut.

<title>Fudge Brownies</title>
<description>

Some people prefer cake-like brownies but the majority of people in North America favor fudge-like brownies.  Moist and gooey with a deep and well balanced chocolate flavor.  Due to the richness this is not the type of brownie you desire as a large piece.  I suggest you keep these under refrigeration since at room temperature they will get rather soft.  If you desire to make a version which is less moist or fudgy add some flour and or cocoa powder.  A less fudgy brownie works very well when heated in a microwave and served with gelato. Non alkalized cocoa is preferred here since the recipe contains baking soda which will naturally alkalize the cocoa powder and provide a very good chocolate flavor.  In terms of chocolate, I use a chocolate of 45% cocoa mass in these brownies.  You could use a chocolate with a higher amount of cocoa mass but keep in mind that brownies need sugar to obtain a fudge-like consistency.  Consequently a brownie made with higher cocoa mass levels will be less fudge-like.
Nuts are delicious in brownies and many types work very well. In this particular brownie I used pre-toasted hazelnuts and candied orange peel.  A personal favorite, however choose a combination which is appealing and makes financial sense in your part of the world.

<title>Chocolate Dipped Cashews</title>
<description>

Top cancer researchers in the world agree that step number one in avoiding cancer is a healthy lifestyle which includes a healthy diet. Some fruits and vegetables are true winners in terms of anti-cancer containing compounds as well as some nuts.  A nut which stands above all others in terms of anti-cancer compounds is the cashew.  Not particularly used a lot in Western style baking and confectionary, partly because it is expensive and partly because it does not have the delicious aroma of hazelnuts or almonds. Two good reasons indeed why the cashew has been sitting in the background.
For this particular confection I wanted to keep the healthy compounds and oils of the cashews intact and did not toast and or caramelize the cashews. Neither did I want to make a toasted cashew paste and use it as a filling or mix the cashews in a delicious caramel or ganache. What I wanted to make is a simple and healthy snack, good for our children, the ones we love and  ourselves.

Chocolate dipped cashews




17 oz
Dark chocolate couverture
500 g



12 oz
Non salted non roasted cashews
360 g

































 

Crystallize or temper the chocolate couverture. Spread approximately one eight of the tempered chocolate on a parchment or acetate sheet. Keep the remaining chocolate in temper by placing it in a microwave oven for a few seconds.
Cut the chocolate as soon as it has set in squares 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm (0.5 inch)
Pipe a few drops of tempered chocolate on each chocolate square and place two cashews on each.
Dip each cashew assembly into tempered chocolate and place on a parchment lined sheet.
Decorate with edible gold leaf if desired.

<title>Coffee Extract</title>
<description>

Most would agree that the aroma of high quality coffee is simply magnificent. Even people who are not fond of drinking coffee tend to like its scent.  Desserts made with coffee extract have an aura of luxury with at the same time being uplifting. Too bad that so many of the coffee extracts available on the market today, taste more like burnt caramel than actual coffee.
To make your own you coffee extract you will need good quality coffee, some artisan coffee merchants make outstanding coffee and then certainly some large companies do as well. There is an amazing Belgian coffee which is rather difficult to purchase in many parts of the world and another favorite of mine is Italian Kimbo, Gold Espresso.  These coffees (Or others, I assume there some good ones in your area) will make great tasting homemade coffee extract which will flavor your desserts to a higher level.
