<title>Coffee Caramels</title>
<description>
 

Caramels are much desired the world over and can be made in many different flavors. While vanilla and chocolate are the most popular ones, coffee pairs exceptionally well with the buttery tones of caramel.
The coffee caramels can be wrapped in cellophane as shown in On Baking, or can be dipped in milk or dark chocolate couverture and finished with a touch of fleur de sel, if so desired.

<title>Artisanal Belgian Chocolate Truffles</title>
<description>

Truffles can be made either by using heavy cream, chocolate and a sweetener or are made with butter, chocolate and a sweetener. Both can be delicious and have their own distinct characteristic. If you desire to make truffles with well pronounced flavor (from liquor, extracts, tea, coffee etc) then butter based truffles may be a good choice. The creamed butter mixture, which is consequently light and airy makes it possible for flavors to really shine through, which can be a challenge when using bitter chocolate.
These truffles are flavored with homemade coffee extract and sprinkled with nougatine.

<title>Lemon Curd Plated</title>
<description>

Lemon, lime or passion fruit curd can easily be turned into delicious desserts which are much appreciated by our customers. Curds made over Bain Marie can be a lengthy process which oftentimes keeps us from making it. The good news is that this formula allows for quick results with unsurpassed smoothness.
Use it for sandwiching petit four, serve with scones, filling for tarts or as shown here as a plated dessert.
 
Assembly:
Prepare curd and pour in frame. Set in refrigerator for one hour and then place in freezer until solid.
Prepare meringue and streusel.
Cut frozen curd quickly into desired size. Place on plate. Allow for defrosting, about 5 minutes.
Decorate with baked meringue, streusel, berries etc.

Quick Lime Curd | Quick lemon curd
This recipe is from On Baking (Named in Europe the best professional book of the world) published with permission from Pearson Prentice Hall
 
Yield: 1 lb 4 oz (619 g)










4 oz
Lime or lemon juice
120 g



6.5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
195 g



0.14 oz
zest
4 g


 
4 oz
Eggs
120 g



6 oz
Unsalted butter*, very soft
180 g
















To use curd as shown in picture use a square frame with approximate size of 9 x 9 inch (23 x 23 cm). Wrap plastic food wrap tightly around frame to create a bottom. Set aside on a baking sheet.
Curd will set properly when made as indicated. Adding one sheet of bloomed gelatin (after cooking process) or one extra egg white (along with whole eggs) may be helpful for plating purpose as this will provide a slightly firmer set.
Bring citrus juice with half of sugar to a boil.
Meanwhile in a bowl whisk eggs with remaining sugar until well combined but not mixed to a thick ribbon.
Temper the egg mixture with a third of boiling above. Pour the tempered mixture into boiling juice and whisk vigorously until boiling and thickened, about a minute. (For large batches increase the boiling time)
Remove from heat and cool on an ice bath to 120°F (50°C)
Add the butter in increments, stirring well with a spatula or add the butter using an immersion blender.
Pour immediately into frame or use in glasses, tart shells etc.

*use high quality butter (82% butterfat) for best results.

<title>Ghent</title>
<description>

Ghent, place of my birth.
With thousands of you visiting chefeddy.com on a daily basis I thought it may be a good idea sharing something more than another recipe. After all, being in the food industry may spark an interest in visiting Belgium some day. Ghent Belgium is rated # 3 on National Geographic’s Travelers list of beautiful historic places. Ghent is nestled between Brussels and Bruges, about a good 40 minute drive either way. Many tourists only visit the named above, too bad for them, as the Historic center of Ghent boasts a complete different type of “feel” and architecture than that of Brussels. It is a must see indeed. The historic center is car free thus you walk along the people who live and work in Ghent and who will quickly make you feel as you already belong. This is NOT a city where you feel as a tourist who MUST visit or buy something to absorb the place. Ghent will slow you down and will make you take your time to enjoy a patio with good coffee, Belgian beer, lunch, dinner, dessert etc. Stay as long as you want on the patio, no one will rush you as the Gent HORECA (HOtel, REstaurant, CAfé) owners will respect and be truly grateful for your visit.
It is true that you can eat exceptionally well in Belgium, (the amount of Michelin rated star restaurants per capita is extraordinarily high). But most of us do not frequent these on a daily basis. When we are in the historic area of Ghent we frequent many restaurants and many are very good, but everyone has favorites and I am sharing mine. For coffee we like to stop at 3,14 (Pi) at the Groentemarkt. Delicious cappuccino and coffee served in a friendly manner in a cool interior make it a great spot indeed. Picture below 3,14

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For lunch or dinner we favor restaurant The Graslei found on n°7 of the street of the same name. When weather is good, take a seat on the breathtaking patio overlooking water and buildings dating from the 13 th century. If the weather is slightly cold, you can still sit on the patio as luxury blankets are on each and every chair and outdoor heaters will be on. Inside, the décor is beautiful, immaculate and stylishly Belgian. Retaining parts of the old building mixed with the new. The food you say? Always delicious and very generous and will make you want to come again, even the same day. Ilse, the proprietor will greet you with tremendous enthusiasm and Jonas and the other attentive wait staff will serve you gracefully and respectfully. Plenty of excellent wine choices at the Graslei, although for lunch or in the afternoon on the patio I may reach for one of Belgium’s most delicious beers, a Trippel Karmeliet, a beer I also use on occasion to cook savory dishes.

<title>Easy Tiramisu</title>
<description>

 
 
 
When preparing desserts for huge events, having enough equipment can be an issue. Who has, let’s say 800 individual rings handy? Therefore I like to teach students ways of using ordinary equipment and yet, still obtaining stylish results. One example is featured here. A standard American type sheet pan is used to obtain this dessert. First thin ladyfinger batter was spread onto a sheet pan and baked. Once cooled and released is was placed on a plastic food film lined sheet pan. Moistened with coffee syrup and then topped with mascarpone cream. After freezing it was released from the pan and cut into rectangle sized shapes.

4 oz
Water
120 ml



6 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
180 g



4
Gelatin leaves (optional*)
4



16 oz

*If using this cream to fill in verrines (glasses) gelatin can be omitted.

Place gelatin leaves in very cold water and set aside.
In a cold bowl whisk heavy cream to very soft, barely a ribbon consistency. Over-whipping will result in poor results. Set aside.
Fill a saucepan with a small amount of water and bring to a boil and then turn to a low simmer.  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks and measured water. Add sugar and whisk well. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the yolk mixture reaches at least 165°F (74°C). Remove from heat.
Remove the gelatin leaves from the water and squeeze well to remove excess water. Whisk the gelatin into the yolk mixture. Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and whisk smooth.
Add the soft whipped heavy cream and gently fold into the above using a spatula. Fill into the mold immediately.

<title>Creamy Cheesecake</title>
<description>

 
Philadelphia Cream cheese is indeed one of the few cheeses which make it possible to create smooth, delectable and creamy cheesecake. However, using a large percentage of this type of cheese for the production of cheesecake, can result in cakes which tend to be a bit heavy for today’s consumer. Therefore I prefer to mix a rather large amount of Greek Yogurt into the cheese mixture. It makes it lighter, while at the same time making it superbly creamy. Greek yogurt also provides a slight tangy flavor found in cream cheese.
When I teach cheesecakes, I have noticed that students tend to pay close attention to the demos and instruction. As is the case with so many things, something as simple as cheesecake is not that simple at all. Oftentimes cheesecakes result in products which “glue” to our palate.
Key things to remember when making cheesecake:

Use cream cheese which is at room temperature. It cuts the amount of time that the mixture will be mixed. Long mixing times breaks down cream cheese and results in a thin batter and consequently a crumbly cheesecake.
Mix on lowest speed possible. Mixing on medium or high speed incorporates air cells. This “soufflés” the cheesecake during baking, but since there is no starch present, it will collapse when removed from oven. This makes it not only unsightly, but it also creates a dry feel in the mouth.
Use a Bain Marie and low temperatures when baking. It creates a superior smooth textured cheesecake.
This recipe does not allow freezing of the cake.

Choose a 20 cm (8 inch) spring form pan wrapped in 3 ply aluminum foil or for a plated dessert use a frame placed on 3 ply aluminum foil. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with extra granulated sugar. Set aside.
On lowest speed using a paddle attachment mix room temperature cheese and sugar. When smooth and lump free ad one egg at a time waiting for previous added egg to be fully incorporated.
Add vanilla, lemon zest and yogurt and mix to combine.
Pour into buttered and sugared molds of choice and place in Bain Marie, bake at 325°F (160°C) until center of cheesecake no longer trembles. Time will depend on pan used.
Unmold next day onto a prebaked crust of choice.

<title>Cinnamon Swirl Raisin Bread</title>
<description>

While I lived in Belgium I was puzzled why cinnamon was used in such large amounts in baked goods in the United States. Later I learned that the type of cinnamon used in North America and many European countries differ. American Pastry Chefs and Bakers mainly use Korintje and Vietnamese “Saigon” Cassia Cinnamon while many European countries use Ceylon Cinnamon. Most baked items can only use a small amount of Ceylon cinnamon since the citrusy and peppery notes it contains quickly become domineering. Vietnamese cinnamon, although not apologetic in flavor intensity works in sweet harmony with sugar, vanilla, caramel and butter.
Interesting to note that for centuries Ceylon cinnamon was considered the best in the world, however selective plantings and hybridizing made Vietnamese Cassia Cinnamon a true star, especially in cookies, breakfast items, breads etc.
In the United States raisin bread is often made containing a “cinnamon swirl”. This swirl is obtained by rolling cinnamon raisin dough into a long rectangle. It is then sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar mixture and rolled up. For an unsurpassed result use high quality Vietnamese Cassia cinnamon. The recipe for cinnamon sugar is below; the raisin bread recipe is in |On Baking|, edition 3 on page 250.
 
 
Yield: 8 ounce, 240 gram



 
1 oz
Vietnamese cinnamon

Extra fine granulated sugar

<title>Candied Kumquat And Lime Curd Filled Toasted Hazelnut Shortbread</title>
<description>

Toasted hazelnuts deliver an incomparable flavor to this shortbread. For optimum flavor, toast hazelnuts in a medium temperature oven until the heart of hazelnuts are golden brown. I do not advise to grind hazelnuts in a food processor without another ingredient present; it most often leads to hazelnut paste. Adding pastry flour to the toasted hazelnuts prevents this from happening.
For optimum flavor prepare dough at least one day in advance as in most cases a fuller aroma develops.
Needed for Assembly:

<title>Kumquat Pink Grapefruit Marmalade</title>
<description>

Marmalades with fresh tasting and refined flavor notes can be very delicious on scones, toast, fillings for certain cakes etc. Combining varieties of citrus into marmalade can create most delectable results and I suggest being adventurous in creating your own. For this particular recipe I use in my opinion, two of some of the most underused fruits in the baking lab: kumquats and Pink Grapefruit. A delightful combination that I particularly like to use with chocolate desserts.
Citrus contains an abundance of pectin which can make the preparation of marmalades quick and efficient and leads to “fresh” (not cooked) flavors. For some citrus marmalades or gelée with low amounts of peel (therefore low amounts of pectin) I will bundle the seeds in a cheesecloth pouch and cook along with the mixture. Seeds of citrus contain pectin as well which will be released during cooking. In general I prefer to use organic fruits when I will use the peel or zest since they are treated with chemicals.
 
Kumquat Pink Grapefruit Marmalade
 




13.5 oz
Kumquats
400 g



1 oz
Pink Grapefruit zest
30 g



13.5 oz
Grapefruit-meat only
400 g



1 lb 8 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
700 g



















































 
 

















































































































Slice kumquats in thin slices and place in a nonreactive saucepan. Add grapefruit zest and grapefruit meats cut in small pieces. Add sugar and combine.
Allow sugar to melt to make stirring over heat easier. Bring to a boil while stirring and simmer on low for approximately 20 minutes or until properly thickened. Cooking on high heat will prevent sugar from penetrating the peel of kumquat and may create crystallization.
If cooked to soft and slightly runny stage (ideal for filling cakes) keep marmalade frozen to prevent spoilage.

<title>Irish Cream Chocolates</title>
<description>

Chocolates filled with liqueur are some of the more complex types of confections made. One classic method to prepare these is to pour liqueur syrup into starch molds, which is a technique that easily can result in disappointment. Many factors such as dryness of starch, humidity of work environment, and syrup have an effect on the success of these confections. A simpler and quicker manner is to fill purchased truffle shells with liquor syrup. Either process, when correctly finished in the right work environment, the surface of the liqueur syrup will obtain a crystallized sugar shell which is then enrobed in couverture chocolate.
Although this may be a classic method of sealing liqueur into chocolates, one may question if it is really the best. Many people feel objection to the crunchy sugar shell and it is their primary reason why they do not consume these. Let’s be honest, it is an odd texture indeed and no other chocolates contain crystallized sugar. If crystallized sugar was delicious or had great texture, we certainly would include it into other chocolates.
Alternatives to crystallized sugar crust are possible and may have their own set of issues; however they still are my preferred method for making liqueur filled chocolates.

Irish Cream Liqueur




8 oz
Whipping cream
240 g



1 oz
Chocolate (54-66% Cocoa mass)
30 g



2 teaspoon
Instant coffee
4 g



14 oz
Sweetened condensed milk
420 g



8 oz
Whiskey (smooth)
240 g









1 teaspoon
Vanilla extract
5 g









 
 
 



 
 
 



























































































































1 Bring heavy cream to a boil. Pour onto chocolate and coffee extract and blend smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk. Pour in Whiskey and vanilla. Allow to completely cool.
2.Make chocolate shells that will provide a flat surface when turned upside down. (no round domes!)
3. Spread couverture onto acetate and cut matching shapes which are slightly larger than mold. Once cut flip upside down and cover with heavy board to keep the cutouts perfectly flat. (Very important)
4. The remaining work is best done with 2 people: Dip the edge of each molded chocolate into tempered (on the warm side) couverture chocolate and fill immediately with liqueur (using a squeeze bottle is a good option). Quickly top with chocolate cutout.
Yields about 90-100 chocolates.

<title>Chestnut Crème Brûlée</title>
<description>

One of the most beautiful trees on earth is without a doubt the chestnut tree.  Sadly, in North America 4 billion chestnut trees were killed by fungus in the 1900’s, which is just one reason why chestnut desserts are hard to find on dessert menus.
Using fresh chestnuts is for many pastry chefs something which is too labor intensive. However, frozen I.Q.F. (individual quick frozen) chestnuts as well as chestnut puree is readily available.
The crème brûlée below is formulated using non sweetened chestnuts, if using sweetened puree reduce the sugar content in this recipe. When selecting fresh chestnuts ensure that the skin feels tight to the meat. Aromatize chestnut desserts with Vanilla, chestnut liquor or Cognac.
 
Chestnut Crème Brûlée
About 8 servings




5 oz
Peeled chestnuts
150 g



8 oz
Milk
240 g



1 oz
Chestnut liquor
30 g



2 teaspoon
Vanilla bean extract
10 g



pinch
Salt
pinch









7 oz
Egg yolk
210 g









7 oz
Light or medium brown sugar
210 g



18 oz
Heavy cream
540 g



4 oz
Candied chestnut pieces
120 g
















Combine peeled chestnuts with milk and blend to fine puree. Add liquor, vanilla and salt. Set aside.
In a bowl whisk yolks and brown sugar vigorously but without making the mixture light and airy. Add heavy cream and chestnut mixture.
Pour in ramekins and place on tray filled with water. Bake at 160°C (325°F) until crème brûlée no longer trembles, about 55 minutes. (Depending on height of ramekin).
Once cooled sprinkle surface with sugar and caramelize, decorate with candied chestnut pieces.

<title>Port Chocolate Pecan Tart</title>
<description>

A common criticism of pecan pie is that it can be sweet, too sweet in fact. However, it does not necessarily have to be that way. If you start by making pecan pie without high fructose corn syrup, you will automatically cut down the high levels of sweetness.  It is a common belief by many people that pecan pie can only be made with corn syrup.  However that is not true, it has been my experience that pecan pies made without corn syrup taste far superior.
For the pecan tart featured here, I decreased the sweetness level even further. Using smooth and good quality Port (Porto) made this possible.  Premium Port has complex flavor notes which harmonize excellent with pecans. Adding a small amount of chocolate enhances this complexity even more.

Line a 24 cm (9.5 inch) wide and 3.2 cm (1.25 inch) high tart pan with sweet tart dough (pate sucrée) and prebake until golden. Brush with egg wash and return briefly to oven. Set aside.

Whisk eggs and Port until combined. Add brown sugar and salt. Add melted butter and vanilla.
Chop half of pecans in small pieces and scatter onto bottom of tart pan. Scatter in chocolate.
Gently pour filling into tart pan about half full. Onto floating pecans pieces arrange pecan halves in a circular fashion starting on edges and working towards center.
In a drizzle fashion pour remaining filling over pecans. Try to cover each and every single pecan.
Place in 160°C (325°F) oven and bake until center is set. If center is rising the tart has slightly been over baked.

<title>Pumpkin Brownies</title>
<description>

The combination of pumpkin and chocolate may be unusual, however it is rather a delicious one. If you want to serve pumpkin brownies as a plated dessert, consider a mandarin sorbet. Oftentimes I am asked if I use fresh pumpkins instead of canned, but I do not. I prefer canned pumpkin as it provides consistent and very good results.
Since the pumpkin part of this brownie provides a good amount of creaminess, I choose a brownie batter formulated with cocoa powder as it creates a less fudgy brownie.

<title>Passion Fruit Chocolate Mousse</title>
<description>

Chocolate mousse remains one of the most popular desserts in the world. Being so prevalent that chocolate mousse mixes are available everywhere and premade chocolate mousse can be found in the refrigerated section of many grocery stores. To differentiate your chocolate mousse, attention to detail and ingredients is very important. What I have found is that chocolate mousse made without egg white or yolk, renders a very nice and deep pronounced chocolate flavor. So much indeed that based on flavor alone it is one of my favorite methods of making chocolate mousse. The melting quality of this mousse is rather refined as well as it will not stick to spoons or knifes.
In school I have seen students obtaining great results using this method as it is a rather simple one. Chocolate mousse containing Italian meringue and or pate a Bombe naturally leave more room for error as there’re more ingredients to juggle.

<title>Opera | Green Tea</title>
<description>
 

It has been my experience that people, who appreciate the classic Opera entremet created by Gaston Lenôtre, are usually equally impressed with a green tea version. In this variation, everything remains as the original; it is only the coffee which is replaced with Matcha (green tea).
For the moistening process of the joconde biscuit, I do prefer to use a typical combination of 3 parts simple syrup and one part green tea liqueur. Green tea liqueur brings finesse and freshness to this cake. For the assembly refer to On Baking 3, on page 645, replacing coffee buttercream with green tea buttercream and replacing coffee moistening syrup with green tea syrup.

Green tea buttercream:
 




17 oz
French style buttercream
500 g



0.25 oz
Green tea powder (Matcha)
8 g




































































































Combine green tea powder in a very small amount of water to form a paste. Combine with buttercream.

<title>Figs in Port</title>
<description>

 
Figs cooked until semi tender in a Port reduction makes a light, elegant and very delicious dessert. Going further by adding a small amount of chocolate to the reduction, just enough to taste the complex flavor notes in both Port and chocolate is even more special. For certain cooking/baking applications decent Port will do, but when Port is used as the principal nucleus, it is a must to use the better type.
Very seldom will I suggest brands, but here it is important as the wrong Port will not create the dessert you are after. For this particular application I prefer a graceful Port, rich in flavor reminiscent of sweet red berries and ending with a fresh velvety finish. The 10 year old Tawny Porto by Croft will provide just that.
Besides Port, figs also love the company of a touch of spice, serving this dessert with Speculoos/ Speculaas cookies or speculoos gelato can be a brilliant combination.
Frequently (also as dessert) I serve this at home with a selection of aged cheese and artisan bread. In such case I do omit the chocolate.

Figs in Port | Figs in Porto
 




8  oz
Tawny Port (Croft)
240 g



1 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
30 g



0.10 oz
Bittersweet chocolate
10 g




























































































































Cut figs in half and set aside.
In a saucepan heat Port and sugar until nearly reduced.
Add figs, cut side down and cook on low-medium heat until figs are thoroughly heated and are “a dente”.
Place on a preheated serving plate and quickly reduce remaining port until it coats the back of a spoon. Swirl in chocolate and pour onto figs. Serve.

<title>Egg Free Ice Cream | Frangelico Ice cream</title>
<description>

In ice cream, egg yolks are used for their stabilizing ability as they bind water, resulting in frozen desserts with a rich mouth feel.  Large ice cream manufacturers often use gums in addition to, or instead of egg yolks. Gums allow hefty amounts of air incorporation during churning, increasing the volume of an ice cream base. Gums are also used to aid in the prevention of ice crystals formation in stored ice cream.
Although it may seem that eggs or gums are a positive ingredient in ice cream making, they do have a negative aspect. For example, egg yolk adds (unwanted) flavor to ice creams and gums, “coat” our taste buds. The “coating” makes it harder for our taste buds to fully experience flavor.  Also, ice creams made with gums will feel less cold, intense and vibrant in the mouth.
Preparing smooth, non icy and luxurious Ice cream without egg yolk and without stabilizers is possible. Good to know since millions of people cannot eat or are allergic to eggs. May I suggest you give this a try? Chances are that you will be amazed with the result.
 
Frangelico Ice Cream | Without Eggs
 




14 oz
Milk
420 g



16 oz
Whipping cream
480 g



7 oz
Light brown sugar
210 g



pinch
Fleur de sel
pinch



5 oz
Frangelico

         Bring milk, cream, brown sugar and salt to a full boil. Remove from heat and place in ice bath.
         When properly chilled add Frangelico and preferably place in a refrigerator overnight before churning.
         Churn according to ice cream manufacturer’s directions.

<title>Almond Petit Four |Lemon Macadamia</title>
<description>

Piped almond petit four are much appreciated by our clients and certainly belong in a luxurious assortment of petit four.  Sugar content in almond paste can vary therefore it is very important to use the right kind. Almond paste with high sugar content will result in petit four which will spread out too much during baking. For the petit four featured here use almond paste containing 63-67% almonds.
Lemon or orange zest can be added to further enhance the flavor of this delicious cookie. After baking and cooling, the petit four can be dipped in mild dark chocolate or milk chocolate. Remember that bitter chocolate can quickly overshadow the delicate almond flavor.

Almond Petit Four | Lemon Macadamia
 




10 oz
Almond paste (63-67% almonds)
300 g



4 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
120 g



1
Zest of lemon
1



2 oz
Egg whites
60 g



3 oz
Macadamia nuts
90 g


















































































Combine almond paste, sugar and lemon zest in bowl fitted with a paddle attachment.
Add a very small amount of egg white and blend until smooth and no lumps remain. Add another small amount of egg whites and blend smooth. Adding egg whites too fast will result in a lumpy paste.
Continue with egg whites until a firm yet pipeable paste is obtained, depending on initial consistency of almond paste not all egg whites may be needed. However, it is also possible that more egg white is required.
Pipe on buttered parchment or silicone mats. Decorate with a few macadamia nut pieces. Allow to crust for 1 hour before baking.
Bake at 400°F (200°C) until light golden.

<title>Tiramisu | Speculoos</title>
<description>

 
 
Mascarpone cream/mousse is very delicious when combined with the complex flavor of speculoos (speculaas). For desserts which nod to Tiramisu, I make ladyfingers containing speculoos spices. Not necessarily a true authentic way of making tiramisu, but delicious nonetheless.
On speculoos / speculaas, recently several books have published recipes for these cookies containing nothing more than cinnamon as the only spice. Authentic speculoos is much more complex and much more delicious when made with a true speculoos spice blend. I suggest you to try the spice blend below in your own speculoos recipe. In On Baking 3, a good recipe for speculoos cookies is found on page 341.
Assembly 
1. Prepare ladyfingers
2. Prepare moistening syrup, when cooled moisten ladyfinger cake and place in glasses /rings/molds
3. Prepare mascarpone cream and fill glasses alternating with moistened ladyfinger cake.
4. Decorate with speculoos cookies/chocolate/sugared and toasted almonds and cocoa powder

If using this cream to fill in verrines (glasses) gelatin can be omitted.

Place gelatin leaves in very cold water and set aside.
In a cold bowl whisk heavy cream to very soft ribbon consistency. Absolutely do not whip to a peak! Set aside.
Fill a saucepan with a small amount of water and bring to a boil and then turn to a low simmer.  In a bowl whisk together egg yolks and measured water. Add sugar and whisk well. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the yolk mixture reaches at least 165°F (74°C). Remove from heat.
Remove the gelatin leaves from the water and squeeze well to remove excess water. Whisk the gelatin into the yolk mixture. Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and whisk smooth.
Add the soft whipped heavy cream and gently fold into the above using a spatula. Fill into the mold immediately.

<title>Nougatine</title>
<description>
 
 
 

 
Nougatine slivers fit perfectly in a high end selection of chocolates and when properly made have a good shelf life, which is another reason, why they are a great addition in a Chocolatiers repertoire. For enthusiastic pastry students*, nougatine is an excellent skill builder. After all chances are you will be making nougatine to include it in ice creams, entremet, showpieces, plated dessert decorations…  I suggest you give it a go!

*Preparing caramel as described here is not easy, especially if you are new to this. Therefore before adding (expensive) almonds, make sure that the caramel is golden-amber and is non grainy.  This type of caramel made without water has a deeper and more delicious caramel flavor compared to caramel made with sugar, water and glucose or corn syrup.

Nougatine




4 oz
Invert sugar
120 g



1 lb 2 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
540 g



8 oz
Toasted almonds
240 g



1 tsp
Vanilla bean seeds
4 g









1.5 oz
Unsalted butter
40 g



pinch
Fleur de sel
Pinch



Optional: Candied orange peel

Set aside a silpat and a rolling pin. If using a wooden rolling pin, butter it lightly. Not necessary if using a silicone rolling pin. Preheat  oven to 300°F (150°C)
In a saucepan bring invert sugar to a boil, add a few tablespoons of the listed sugar and stir to melt sugar (Do not allow to caramelize at this point). Add a few more tablespoons of sugar and stir until melted again. Continue with slowly adding larger amounts of sugar. Do not vigorously stir at any point.
Cook to a golden-amber caramel stirring gently. Remove from heat (If you do not have a perfect non grainy caramel at this point, do not waste almonds. Simply throw it out and do it again), immediately add butter, vanilla, salt followed by toasted almonds. Stir to combine with a heat resistant or wooden spatula.
 Scrape the nougatine onto the silpat. Let sit for a few moments and then start gently rolling the nougatine into a thin sheet about the thickness of 3 stacked credit cards.
If the nougatine hardens before it is sufficiently thin, keep it on the silpat and place it in the oven to slowly soften. Press with a finger to check if it is soft enough and then roll once more.
When cooled break nougatine into organic shapes.  Place a piece of candied orange peel on the surface if desired.
Dip into tempered chocolate of choice (I do recommend a non bitter dark chocolate as bitter chocolate quickly overtakes the caramel and almond flavor notes).

<title>Spritz | Eddy Van Damme</title>
<description>

It is easy to see why so many people appreciate Sablés Viennois or Spritz, they are attractive and people like the sandy buttery texture of these simple, yet sophisticated petit four.  Whether served with espresso, tea or gelato they always prove to be a hit.
A few things are important to ensure a gorgeous baked product. One is the type of flour, if it is too weak in protein the batter may spread too much in the oven resulting in a product without clear marks on the surface.  Therefore I recommend using good quality pastry flour. Second, do not over cream butter as this will create too much spreading of the product in the oven. Resulting in lost surface marks as well.
Baking is best done in a deck using ample bottom heat to ensure that jam will not stick to silpat when petit four are removed. If using a convection oven I recommend using a thinly made baking tray or perforated baking tray.

Sablés Viennois | Spritz
 










1 lb 2.5 oz
Butter, at room temperature
560 g



8.5 oz
Powdered sugar
250 g

<title>Pistachio Ice Cream</title>
<description>
 
 
 

One of the most luxurious ice cream or gelato is without a doubt pistachio. Irresistible when combined with chocolate, strawberries, apricots ….
You certainly can turn this into gelato and replace whipping cream with an equal amount of milk. Doing so will bring out a more pronounced pistachio flavor but the reduction of fat will in turn decrease   conservation. (Not a problem if consumed say day as it was churned) Either way, use the amount of pistachios as indicated in this recipe to obtain a most wonderful texture and flavor.
 
Pistachio Ice Cream |Pistachio Gelato
 




1 lb 1 oz
Milk
500 g



6 oz
Whipping cream
180 g



1.75 oz
Non fat milk powder
50 g



4.5 oz + 2 oz
Pistachios (non salted)
135 g + 60 g



2 oz
Invert sugar
60 g









2.5 oz + 2 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
75+ 60 g









0.2 oz
Ice cream stabilizer (optional)*
5 g



3 oz
Egg yolk
90 g















 
 

















































































































Bring milk, cream, milk powder, pistachios (135 g-4.5 oz), invert sugar and 75 g (2.5 oz) sugar to boil.
Whisk 60 g (2 oz) granulated sugar and ice cream stabilizer *(if using) together and whisk rapidly in yolks until doubled in volume.
Pour 250 ml (8 oz) of boiled mixture into yolks and whisk smooth.  Pour tempered yolk mixture into remaining cream, on low heat and while constantly stirring using a rubber spatula heat to 83°C (183°F).
Remove from heat. Pour mixture into a blender (pacotize) and mix until pistachios are superfine and green color is obtained.
Chill immediately in ice bath. Cover and chill overnight in refrigerator.
Lightly toast remaining pistachios in oven. Chop in medium pieces and place in freezer.
Following day churn in pre-chilled ice cream machine.  When ice cream is churned add frozen and chopped pistachios.
Use as desired.

<title>Pistachio Chocolates</title>
<description>

In many assortments of chocolates, the pistachio variety can be one of the most eye catching, indeed, bright green pistachios on chocolate is a very striking look.  The filling of pistachio chocolates can be approached in different ways.  Using almond paste as a base, which is further enhanced with pistachio paste and other ingredients is popular and delicious resulting is a texture similar as marzipan. However, not all countries in the world are fond of this particular texture and therefore another approach of pistachio chocolates may have to be used.  Regardless of how you make fillings for chocolates, important to remember is that pistachio flavor can easily be lost in ganache made of bitter dark chocolate.

The pistachio chocolates recipe featured here is made using cream, pistachios, white chocolate and Dumante pistachio liqueur.  Instead of pistachios a good quality unsweetened pure pistachio paste can also be used.  Adding aromatized pistachio paste is an option if yet a stronger pistachio flavor is desired. The pistachio chocolates featured on the photos are made without green food color, if a greener color is desired add coloring after adding Dumante pistachio liqueur.

 
 
Pistachio Chocolates

Heavy cream
12 oz



225 g
Pistachios (non salted)
7.5 oz



pinch
Fleur de sel
Pinch



60 g
Invert sugar
2 oz



700 g
White chocolate, small pieces
24 oz









60 g
Dumante pistachio Liqueur
2 oz









As needed
Semis sweet chocolate for enrobing
As needed




























In a saucepan bring to boil cream, pistachios, fleur de sel and invert sugar.  Remove from heat and pour into a well made blender. Mix until very smooth paste is obtained. Add Dumante pistachio liqueur.
Remove from blender and stir in chocolate. If part of chocolate refuses to melt completely, place bowl for 5-10 seconds at a time in microwave oven.
Pour pistachio ganache between confectionary rulers.
Allow crystallizing for 18-24 hours slightly below 20°C (70°F).  Do NOT refrigerate at this stage as doing so will encourage mold and bacteria growth. (W hen ganache is removed from a refrigerator condensation will form on the surface, the condensation will be trapped when ganache is dipped in tempered chocolate. It is exactly in that area where mold and bacteria start to grow.)
Cut in desired size and enrobe in tempered dark chocolate. Decorate with pistachios.

<title>Gianduja Cremeux</title>
<description>

Gianduja certainly belongs in a collection of good quality chocolates and can equally be effective in many desserts. It pairs very well with a vast amount of flavors which makes it very appealing for us in the pastry atelier. Flavors such as coffee, passion fruit, citrus, chocolate, certain peppers are prime candidates for pairing.
This Gianduja cremeux can also be made with an in house version of Gianduja as I show here .  If using the in house version you will have to slightly increase the gelatin amount. However may I recommend keeping the gelatin amount low to retain a very silky and tender textured cremeux?

Gianduja Cremeux:
 




17 oz
Heavy cream
500 g



17 oz
Milk
500 g



3.5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
100 g



6 oz
Egg yolk
180 g



pinch
salt
pinch



3
Gelatin sheets/leaves
3



16 oz
Milk chocolate Gianduja, chopped
470 g









4 oz
Frangelico liqueur
120 g


























































Place gelatin sheets in ice water and set aside.
Bring cream and milk to boil. Meanwhile whisk yolks and sugar to ribbon consistency. Add one fourth of boiling mixture to yolks and whisk rapidly.
Pour tempered yolks to remaining boiled cream and heat gently while constantly stirring using a rubber spatula to 82°C (183°F).
Remove from heat, press gelatin sheets and whisk into the mixture.  Whisk in Gianduja. Add Frangelico.
At this stage the mixture may look foamy and it is best to set into an ice bath stirring occasionally. This will slowly erase the foamy layer and allow a beautiful surface when poured in verrines.
If using cake or dacquoise in the verrine, pre-chilling the cremeux will prevent these from floating to the surface. “Gluing” these down with chocolate is also effective.
Pour in verrines, cover with plastic food wrap and place in refrigerator. Setting will take 4 hours and complete setting will take 15 hours.
Decorate with lime marshmallow as shown on my site here and chocolate caramel tuile.

<title>Frangelico in desserts</title>
<description>

Frangelico with its deep rich aroma of hazelnuts can bring finesse to a variety of desserts. Pairing can successfully be done with grapefruit and other citrus, chocolate, coffee and several other ingredients. Mascarpone cheese is another product which makes a great combination with Frangelico. This dessert certainly winks to tiramisu although it does not contain coffee, in fact the genoise is moistened in Frangelico syrup. We in the profession know that our customers do like Tiramisu-esque desserts and therefore this one may be a good dessert for serving a large gathering of people (Hotel-Country Club events…).
Our friends at PCB creation http://www.pcb-creation.fr/ have a great amount of pastry specialty items to give desserts a special flair. The mascarpone cream featured here was poured on one of their structure sheets named matlelassees.  When using such sheets ensure that your products are well frozen before removing the structure sheets to obtain a clean look. As a side, note one of the greatest North American interior designers John Saladino often uses matelassee fabric in his interior designs and the House of Chanel uses matelasee pattern on watches and more.  How close indeed the world of patisserie is connected to the world of design.

<title>Raspberry Mint Sorbet</title>
<description>

Simple desserts do not necessarily translate into boring. A minimal composition of raspberry mint sorbet sandwiched between thin sheets of cocoa nib topped chocolate is an example of such.
For most sorbets I recommend a combination of sugars such as invert sugar, glucose and granulated sugar. Invert sugar and glucose along with pectin (or other stabilizing product) will control crystallization and provide a smoother product with a very good mouth feel.  Stabilizers are especially helpful when sorbet is stored in freezers which do not maintain a steady temperature.

 
Raspberry Mint Sorbet
 










15 oz
Water
450 g



7 oz
Granulated sugar
210 g



0.33 oz
Apple pectin
10 g



4 oz
glucose
120 g



1oz
Invert sugar
30 g









0.33 oz
Mint extract
10 g









2 lb 3 oz
Raspberry puree
1000 g



























 

Pour water in saucepan. Thoroughly combine granulated sugar with pectin. Add to water, add glucose. Whisk to boil.
Allow to cool and preferably allow maturing for 4 hours (or several days) in a refrigerator before adding fruit puree.
Add invert sugar, mint extract and fruit puree.
Churn in ice cream machine. If working with a semi commercial ice cream machine ensure that the machine is not over filled, that it has been well pre-chilled and that the sorbet mixture is very cold when adding to machine.  This will ensure fast churning and thus resulting in a very smooth texture. (The longer the sorbet is being churned the larger the ice crystals will be)

<title>Noble Chocolate Cream</title>
<description>

Noble chocolate cream is a cousin of chocolate cremeux but made without egg yolk. Another difference is that it contains higher amount of milk than whipping cream, this allows the chocolate flavor to be fully pronounced. (High fat content has a tendency to masks flavors) Since no eggs are present and a smaller amount of cream is used, the gelatin is slightly increased. However this cream is not firm or gelatinous, instead it is silky, luxurious and superbly creamy without carrying an overly rich feeling.
For this cream I recommend using chocolate with cocoa mass content in the mid 50 range with a deep and well pronounced chocolate flavor.
For our Patisserie student readers: A higher amount of cocoamass does not necessarily equal a stronger chocolate flavor. Chocolate flavor intensity will rely on several factors such as the cocoa butter content, roasting of the beans and more. (Think of coffee beans, one brand will make rich tasting coffee while another brand will be mild).
Since this cream does not contain eggs or cream which is whipped, it is a prime candidate to compare chocolate brands and how well they perform  in terms of residual chocolate flavor.  Use different brands of chocolate containing identical cocoa mass may reveal surprising results. Often, what is superior in terms of tasting it as pure chocolate may leave a less pronounced flavor as a finished product.
Note: If the Noble cream develops a firmer set than desired, reduce the amount of gelatin. Not all chocolate will result in the the same setting.

<title>Petit Four Sec</title>
<description>

Many grocery stores in the world carry machine made cookies/petit four/biscuits which are made with pure butter, good quality chocolate and natural ingredients. This certainly makes it more challenging for us in the pastry lab to produce these products which surpasses the competition. One advantage we have is that many of our cookies/petit four can easily be adjusted to the seasons or specific holidays. A second benefit is that we can use ingredients which have a rather short shelf life which the giant manufacturers cannot.  Another plus is that some cookies are only amazing the day they were made. Take for example a chocolate chip cookie, highly desired when they are soft and chewy which can only be produced by a bakery/Patisserie/home. Interesting about these cookies is that in many parts of the world these are baked to a crisp state. In the United States, the crisp version of chocolate chip cookies are primarily made by the giants and packaged.
 
Petit Four

















































































































Roll chilled coconut shortbread* 2.5 mm (1/8 inch) thick. Cut into circles and bake at 180°C (375°F)) until blond in color- not golden brown.
Using a small star tip pipe a border of almond macaronade* on the edge.
Return to same degree oven and bake until golden color. If needed use a double baking sheet to prevent excess browning of the bottom.
Once cooled place a slice of candied kumquat in each petit four.
Fill with crystallized milk chocolate or low cocoamass dark chocolate. (Or a blend of the two)

<title>Mendiants</title>
<description>

Of all the chocolates Mendiants are one of the easiest and fastest to make and are very much appreciated by our clients. Traditionally they are made with dark chocolate and a variety of nuts and candied fruits but the ones featured here are made with Valentines in mind.
Since many of our customers are not excited about white chocolate you may decide to add some additional flavoring to enhance it to your standards. For these I added vanilla bean to the white chocolate as it blends very well with the freeze dried strawberries, dried cherries, cranberries and macadamia nut.
Freeze dried strawberries will get soft when exposed to a refrigerator or high humidity. Packaging these is recommended.

<title>Chocolate mousse</title>
<description>

When we think about Valentine’s Day the heart is what primarily comes to mind. For many years the only device we had to create a heart, was a heart shape cutter. Things have changed for the better and now we have access to 3 dimensional heart shaped Flexipan. Pastry Chefs the world over, like to use these since they facilitate beautiful desserts, in quick and hygienic ways with unsurpassed results.
The possibilities are endless, whether you want to mould a lemon-passion fruit cream as shown on my site here, a Bavarian, a mousse etc.  Working Pâtissiers already know, but for the enthusiastic pastry students out there, it is important to remember that when making mousses and creams for Flexipan to keep the following in mind. If your recipe has temperature guidelines follow these strictly and make certain that the whipping cream is only whipped to a very soft consistency.  Of course these rules apply anytime, however to ensure a beautiful molded mousse or cream using Flexipan, make certain the recipe was correctly performed and this way you truly will obtain unrivaled products.  The chocolate mousse recipe below works tremendously well in Flexipan and I highly recommend you give it a try. The texture and flavor of the chocolate mousse will not disappoint.  If desired serve the chocolate mousse with raspberry sorbet and caramel tuile as featured in the picture.

Chocolate mousse
 




13 oz
Milk
390 g

1.Whip the whipping cream to very soft consistency. (Thick but slightly pourable)
2.Bring the milk to a boil and remove from heat. Allow to cool for 2 minutes. Remove gelatin from water and press to remove excess water. Whisk into the hot milk.
3.Pour half of the milk-gelatin mixture into the chocolate and whisk well. Gradually add the remaining milk and whisk until smooth.
4.Allow the mixture to cool down (or bring to) to (110°F) 43°C and add all the whipped cream at once. Using a rubber spatula fold gently until combined.
5.Pour into the Flexipan and place in freezer overnight.

<title>Tuiles</title>
<description>

We all know that many plated desserts can go from ordinary to extraordinary by simply adding an eye catching tuile. It is the reason why so many of us use them in our work on a daily basis. Made round, square, into long strips, curved, left flat, rolled, the possibilities are nearly endless. Besides being placed on a plated dessert they also fit perfectly on a petit four platter and can be delicious when dipped in chocolate.
Tuiles suffer quickly when exposed to humidity and are therefore best made daily or packaged air tight with desiccant.  Personally, for even results I prefer to make tuiles using Flexipan since it allows for efficient work with excellent results.  Certainly Silpat can be used as well.
The recipe below is composed of lime and grapefruit juice but these juices can be replaced with passion fruit. Some tuiles can be a greasy upon removal from the oven but these are well balanced and do not require pectin or glucose. For the students out there, tuiles need to be scaled exact to ensure a lacy texture.
 

Tuiles Recipe










2 oz
Butter, room temperature
60 g



5 oz
Powdered (Confectioners) sugar
150 g



pinch
Salt
2 g



1 oz
Lime juice
30 g



1 oz
Grapefruit juice
30 g









1.33 oz
Pasty/all purpose flour
40 g


























 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 




Cream the butter and add powdered sugar and salt. Cream until light.
Gradually add the fruit juices.
Blend in the flour. Allow to mature for 1 hour before baking or overnight in a refrigerator.
Pipe small amount s of the batter into Flexipan or onto Silpat. If desired place a slice of candied kumquat onto the batter and bake in a 350°F (180°C) oven until light golden.
For shaped tuiles remove from the pan and shape into desired forms. For flat tuiles allow to cool in pan.
Once cooled store airtight with a desiccant.

<title>Candied kumquats</title>
<description>

Kumquats are some of the quickest and least complicated fruits to candy. From start to finish, semi candied kumquats can be achieved within 40 minutes.  A drastic time difference compared to the preparation of candied orange peels which are blanched several times to remove bitterness from the peel and are then followed by an extensive candying process.
Semi candied kumquats are well liked by our customers, therefore if you have desserts which you want to enhance with an orange-citrus component, they can be an excellent choice. Think about adding semi candied kumquats to gelato, layered in entremets, yogurt desserts, in cheesecake, in ganache etc.

 
Semi candied Kumquats | Semi Candied Cumquats




17 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
500 g



17 oz

8 oz
Glucose
240 g



12 oz

360 g
























































































In a non reactive saucepan bring to a boil the sugar, water and glucose.
Slice the kumquats crosswise in 2 mm thick slices.
Add the sliced kumquats to the boiling syrup and turn to simmer.
Simmer on low for approximately 30 minutes or until tender.
Allow to cool and store in a refrigerator.

<title>Pâte à Choux with Streusel</title>
<description>

Pâte à Choux topped with streusel or crumble has some real advantages.  One, a smooth rounded surface on profiteroles or éclairs is easily obtained. Two, the added flavor and texture of streusel is a welcoming factor to the rather bland flavor of Pâte à Choux. Three, profiteroles or éclairs expand much larger and more uniformly compared to choux paste which is not topped with streusel. Four, the interior of the choux paste products is visibly more hollow.

For us in the baking industry having éclairs or profiteroles crack in the oven is disappointing and therefore I bake choux paste at rather low oven temperatures. Using flour with fairly high protein content allows for extra eggs in the batter, which in turn permits lower oven temperatures but with good expansion of the products.  Adding a small amount of steam in the oven as soon as the pate a choux is loaded in the oven also helps very well with the prevention of cracks.
Photo below: Profiteroles piped the same size, baked on same tray. The one topped with streusel expands visibly larger.

Place the mixture into a bowl fitted with the paddle attachment, on medium speed gradually add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bowl often. Once 14 oz (420 g) of the eggs are added examine the batter, it should be smooth and have a light sheen. It should be firm enough to hold its shape when piped. Add the remaining egg if needed.
Pipe the batter using a plain tip on parchment lined sheet pans.
Cut the streusel in circles 10% smaller than the piped pate a choux and place on the surface.
Place in a (lightly steam injected) oven at 350°F (180°C) with steam vent closed. When the products are well expanded, open the steam vent (or part oven door) to let the steam escape. Bake until the products are crisp when pressed on the sides. About 27-33 minutes for profiteroles.

<title>Hazelnut & Orange Chocolate Bar</title>
<description>
 

After talking to countless Pastry chefs and Chocolatiers who are in search of fillings for chocolates with an extended shelf life, I thought it was time to highlight such filling which may be of use to you.  This particular filling contains nougatine which adds a layer of complexity, but the good news is that the nougatine is chopped and therefore rolling it to a thickness of 2 stacked bank cards is not a total necessity.  Although on the picture this particular filling is piped into a chocolate bar mold, any shallow type of chocolate mold should work.  The filling tilts on the sweet side and therefore I do recommend to use shallow chocolate mold as the flavor balance between the chocolate and the filling will then be optimal. For the molding process I recommend a semi sweet chocolate couverture with a cocoa mass content of 52-58% maximum. Milk chocolate mixed with dark chocolate can also work well and be equally delicious. Using ¾ milk chocolate couverture combined with ¼ dark chocolate couverture will provide good balance. Using bitter chocolate for the molding process will make it hard to properly experience the hazelnut flavor which we all know is a rather expensive ingredient not to be noticed.

<title>Gianduja</title>
<description>
 

Gianduja is a highly desired filling for chocolates as it is both delicious and luxurious. Many recipes and methods to prepare Gianduja exist but all contain similar ingredients. These mainly include hazelnuts, sugar and chocolate and at times with lesser amounts, milk powder and cocoa butter. Some of us in the pastry lab also make Gianduja using part hazelnuts and part almonds. To make a silky smooth Gianduja a roller refiner machine is necessary; however a good quality food processor can provide good results as well. The recipe for Gianduja below is made using purchased hazelnut paste, for a recipe using raw hazelnuts see my recipe here on my site.



Chocolates which are made using pure Gianduja (Thus no fillings which contain Gianduja but also include butter, cream, fruit purees etc) can be kept for a much longer time if compared to standard ganache. The extended shelf life is attributed to a very low Aw value of chocolate and hazelnut paste, the main components. Ganache an emulsion of chocolate and cream (which contains a large amount of water) has a high Aw value. Remember, generally speaking the higher the Aw value of chocolate fillings the shorter its shelf life will be. Fillings with high Aw values are perfect breeding grounds for micro organisms. Certainly there is more than the Aw value which determine shelf life, but for chocolates made in high sanitary conditions and using the correct working methods the Aw value is a very important one. In upcoming work I will go deeper into this subject.
When using Gianduja in chocolates it is important to remember that the delicate flavor of hazelnuts can easily be lost. Using chocolate with a cocoa mass content of 60% or higher will make it harder for your consumers to fully appreciate the wonderful Gianduja flavor.
Gianduja Chocolates with Dried Cranberries




17 oz
Hazelnut paste, sweetened
500 g



7 oz
Milk chocolate (38-42% cocoa)
210 g



3 oz
Dried Cranberries
90 g



For enrobing, as needed
Semisweet chocolate 52-58%
For enrobing, as needed
























































































 This Gianduja can be made and poured between candy rulers or can be left to crystallize and then rolled between thick plastic to desired thickness. The chocolates featured here were made using a frame which allows the creation of an uneven surface.
 Using candy rulers create a frame of approximately 12 x 12 inch (30 x 30 cm) onto a silpat. Set aside.
 For fast setting of the Gianduja temper the chocolate and mix with room temperature hazelnut paste followed by cranberries.
 Pour into the frame and even out using an offset spatula. If not using a frame allow the Gianduja to set in the bowl, stirring every few minutes for even cooling. Once crystallized remove from bowl and roll to desired thickness between plastic sheets.
After several hours or overnight (do not refrigerate) cut into desired size.
Temper dark chocolate couverture and enrobe the Gianduja centers. “Mark” the surface using your dipping fork.

<title>Chocolate Mints</title>
<description>

There is something to be said to have chocolates in your repertoire which hold a long shelf life. It can make your work schedule a lot easier since you can make these types of chocolates well in advance of busy holidays.   One type of filling which will certainly keep fresh for at least 6 months is a Confiserie fondant type. Often used in economy chocolate selections since it is an inexpensive type of filling with the additional benefit of long conservation.  They are frequently flavored with liquors and or flavoring compounds to mask its sweetness and of course to give flavor.  Using chocolate with higher cocoa mass content is another way to balance the high sugariness.  Fondant type of fillings tend to work best in rather low depth chocolate molds where it is easier to achieve a good balance between the sweet filling and bittersweet chocolate.
Confiserie fondant mixed with peppermint oil is a classic and well liked in many parts of our world.  The cooling sensation of peppermint combined with good bittersweet chocolate is a delicious pleasure indeed.  Few of us make our own confiserie fondant but for our pastry students who cannot readily purchase this fondant you can find the recipe on my site here.

Mint Chocolates




17 oz
Confiserie fondant
500 g



As needed
Peppermint oil or extract
As needed



Optional
Mint liquor
optional



As needed
Bittersweet chocolate 58-65%
As needed
























































































 Line chocolate molds with tempered chocolate and place upside down in a refrigerator until the chocolate starts to contract.
 Warm fondant in a microwave oven to 85F (cccccccccc) add peppermint oil or extract to taste. Add a very small amount of water or liquor to bring to a thick but pipeable consistency.  Keep well covered to prevent a skin from forming.
 Fill the molds 2 mm from edge.  If desired sprinkle with cocoa nibs. Allow the fondant to “crust”.
 Cover with tempered chocolate and place in the refrigerator.
 Unmold.

<title>Ginger Ice Cream</title>
<description>
 

 
Although ginger is used in the savory kitchen year round, it seems that most of us in the pastry kitchen (especially in the West) use it mainly during the fall and winter season.  One of the things that I like about ginger is that it can be very effective in creating an aura of excellence to desserts. Another reason is that ginger does wonders for the digestion system, which makes it a natural good choice for desserts. Ginger pairs very well with citrus and candied kumquat or candied orange peel are very good choices to incorporate into this ice cream dessert.
Once the ice cream is churned spread it into pre-chilled molds or rectangular mousse frames and layer with candied citrus and broken nougatine pieces. Allow to freeze 12 hours before unmolding and decorating.

 Bring the milk and cream to a boil. Remove from heat and add the ginger. Cover and infuse for 45 minutes.
 Return to heat source and heat to approximately 200°F (93°C). In a separate bowl whisk the yolks, sugar, honey and salt until thick and pale. Temper with 1/8 of the milk mixture, whisk well and add to the heated above. Using a rubber spatula stir constantly until a thermometer reaches 183°F (83°C).
 Remove from heat and pour in a chinois.
 Cover and place in an ice bath. When properly chilled place in a refrigerator overnight before churning.

<title>Peppermint Panna Cotta with Cranberry Coulis</title>
<description>

All of us in the Patisserie world know very well that during the busy Holiday season, having a quick to prepare winter dessert in your collection never hurts. This one does not disappoint and is very well liked. The combination of peppermint and cranberry is contemporary and the flavors work in perfect harmony.
In this dessert and some others, I prefer to use mint extract or mint essential oil over steeping fresh mint leaves. A good extract provides clean and fresh notes which are hard to achieve when using fresh leaves. Most often, brewed mint leaves exude grassy herbal notes which are not desired.

<title>Pumpkin Cheesecake</title>
<description>

 
Not every country in the world is fond of pumpkin desserts but for the places which do, pumpkin cheesecake is a welcoming finish to a good meal. A nice thing about using pumpkin in cheesecake is that pumpkin makes this dessert lighter in fat calories, enhances the creaminess and makes the dessert very fitting for the fall season.  For any type of cheesecake I recommend baking the crust separate and placing the baked and cooled cheesecake onto the baked crust. This prevents a disappointing bottom.  The flavor profile of this cheesecake works very well if placed on prebaked gingersnap crumbles or speculaas (speculoos).

 
Pumpkin Cheesecake
About 30 individual servings




3 lb
Cream cheese (Philadelphia)
1440 g



1 lb 8 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
720 g



8
Large eggs

2 teaspoon
Vanilla extract
10 g



¼ teaspoon
Salt
1 g









2 tbps
Orange zest
6 g









1 Tbsp
Cinnamon (Vietnamese Cassia)
6 g



2 tsp
Ginger, dried
4 g



1 lb 14 oz
Pumpkin puree, cooked
900 g














































 Allow the cream cheese to come at room temperature for easy blending.
 Combine the cream cheese and the sugar on low speed until smooth and no lumps remain. Scrape well.
 Add eggs one at a time waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated before adding next. Scrape often in between.
 Add all the flavorings and the pumpkin puree.
 Brush rings lightly with oil and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Wrap two sheets of aluminum foil underneath each ring and place in a roasting pan or a pan with high edges. Fill the rings with the batter.
 Pour water into the roasting pan to create a Bain Marie, about ½ inch (2 cm) of water surrounding the rings.
 Place in a 325°F (160°C) oven and bake until the center is set and no longer trembles, about 43 minutes.
 Allow to cool for several hours in the refrigerator before removing from the ring.
 If desired spray with cocoa butter and decorate as desired.

<title>Corn Syrup Free Pecan Pie</title>
<description>

For some time now I have wanted to write another article on pecan pie which is one of the most beloved desserts in the United States. Just like brownies it is a dessert which is gaining popularity worldwide. In America, many of our customers believe that pecan pies have to be made with corn syrup, not knowing that the original pecan pies were actually made with brown sugar. In the early 20th century less expensive corn syrup started to replace brown sugar and became the custom for pecan pies.
Several years ago, I started working on a corn syrup free pecan pie recipe because I felt that corn syrup versions were too sweet and the flavor was never “clear”. Since then I have been making pecan pies with brown sugar with excellent results and an unsurpassed flavor which I believe will be loved by your customers as well.

Although this recipe works perfect as is, for this particular pecan pie I have added some dark chocolate which further cuts the sweetness.  Pecans do like the company of Dark Rum, Cognac or Brandy and I do recommend adding some.  Most often pecan pies are made using standard pie dough (pâte brisée) but there is something to be said for using sweet tart dough (pate sucrée) instead. A prebaked sweet tart dough shell ensures a well baked crust which can be hard to achieve when using standard pie dough and rack ovens.
 
Pecan pie without corn syrup
Yield: 2 – 9 inch pies










 










6
Large eggs
6



12 oz
Water
240 g



1 lb 12 oz
Medium brown sugar
840 g


 
1 tsp
Salt
5 g



4 oz
Butter, melted
120 g









1 oz
Dark Rum, Cognac or Brandy
30 g



1 tbsp
Vanilla extract
15 g



1 lb
Pecan halves
480 g














 
4 oz
Chocolate (58-64% cocoa   mass)
120 g


 
 
 
 



 

Line 2 pie tins with sweet tart dough and prebake. Alternatively use pie dough (pâte brisée) and do not prebake.
Whisk together the eggs and water until smooth. Add brown sugar, salt, butter, liquor and vanilla extract.
Chop less than half of the pecans in small pieces and scatter in the pie shells along with the chocolate.  Fill with the filling about half full. The pecan pieces will automatically float.
Arrange the pecan halves in a circular fashion above the floating pecan pieces.
Carefully drizzle the remaining filling over the pecan halves.
For a pie made with sweet tart dough place in a 325°F (160°C) oven and bake until the center is set, about 65 minutes total. For pies made with standard pie dough place the pies in a 400°F (200°C) oven for 10 minutes and then reduce the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C), bake until the center is set.

<title>Gateau Opera</title>
<description>

Few desserts possess an air of luxury as much as the gateau Opéra does.  A true classic which combines some of the most refined flavors we have on earth: coffee, chocolate and almonds. Our customers respond to it very well as these flavors are enjoyed by nearly everyone
Opéra is rather rich and a small piece is usually sufficient. On occasion, I have served Opera along chocolate sorbet to cut the richness somewhat, but in all honesty, Opera is pure perfection and just delicious by itself.
One of the great attributes of Opera is that it not only freezes very well, but it also is easily made into an entremet to be sold in a patisserie, cut for a plated dessert or served as a petit four.  On an entremet, oftentimes the word Opera is written but for smaller servings one can use his/her imagination.
For a plated version of the opéra I find nougatine a very effective decoration and a further enhancement to this delicious dessert.

<title>Black Rice Cream</title>
<description>

In many parts of the world desserts made with rice have been popular for centuries and are often made into home style versions. Milk, sugar, cinnamon sticks, vanilla bean and rice is cooked until the rice is tender and the mixture has turned into a creamy consistency.  Nothing particularly wrong with that, but most of us need to be a little more creative to entice today’s consumer.
Some people dislike the typical mouth feel of rice desserts but this can easily be manipulated. For instance, in the dessert featured here whipped cream is folded in, which quickly transforms a thick and heavy texture to a lighter and creamy one. Adding fruit to rice desserts works extraordinarily well to further enhance the overall eating sensation.  Many types of fruit work very well with rice desserts, from sweet to slightly tart.
Not everyone is familiar with black rice therefore I like to share that black rice is not necessarily better tasting compared to white rice. However it is indeed eye catching. Black rice takes a very long time to become tender but it does provide the rice cream a rather nice lavender hue. Certainly this dessert can easily be made with short grain rice which will make the cooking time much shorter.

Coconut Black Rice Cream
Yield: 6-8 servings
 




1 quart  3 oz
Homemade coconut milk
1 lit



6 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
180 g



1
Vanilla bean, split
1



pinch
Salt
pinch



6 oz
Black rice (forbidden rice)
180 g









12 oz
Whipping cream
360 g











 


























































 Combine the homemade coconut milk, sugar, split vanilla bean, salt and black rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
 Cover and simmer on very low heat until the rice is tender, about 2 hours. If necessary add a small amount of milk to keep the mixture properly hydrated.
 Remove from heat and allow to cool.
 Whip the whipping cream to very soft peaks. Before folding the cream into the rice ensure that the rice mixture is creamy and will allow for easy folding in of the cream. If necessary add a small amount of milk.
 Pour into glasses and place in a refrigerator. Once cold decorate as desired.  This dessert is served with Mango-passion fruit coulis.

<title>Homemade Coconut Milk</title>
<description>

It is not easy to find good quality coconut milk which provides consistent results and has an excellent coconut flavor.  Some canned coconut milks are very fatty or thick, others are very liquid without much flavor. Coconut milk can also be prohibitive expensive for use in coconut cream pies or other common preparations.  Our vendors do sell coconut extract, which some is natural and some artificial, however most extracts make me think of sun tan lotion rather than real coconut.
Making your own coconut milk is very easy and provides a natural flavor. Standard dairy milk is what I usually use, but for specialty diets, soy, almond, flax seed milk and others will work just the same. If you need whipping cream with a coconut flavor use the same method as the recipe below. Although a fuller flavor will be obtained when using regular milk versus a high fat containing cream. For a toasted coconut flavor in your gelato, panna cotta, ice creams etc, simply toast the coconut first.
Since coconut is sold in many versions in the world and to prevent confusion, the coconut to look for is what most of us already have in our pastry lab: Unsweetened desiccated or unsweetened finely shredded coconut.

<title>Fudge Brownies</title>
<description>

Some people prefer cake-like brownies but the majority of people in North America favor fudge-like brownies.  Moist and gooey with a deep and well balanced chocolate flavor.  Due to the richness this is not the type of brownie you desire as a large piece.  I suggest you keep these under refrigeration since at room temperature they will get rather soft.  If you desire to make a version which is less moist or fudgy add some flour and or cocoa powder.  A less fudgy brownie works very well when heated in a microwave and served with gelato. Non alkalized cocoa is preferred here since the recipe contains baking soda which will naturally alkalize the cocoa powder and provide a very good chocolate flavor.  In terms of chocolate, I use a chocolate of 45% cocoa mass in these brownies.  You could use a chocolate with a higher amount of cocoa mass but keep in mind that brownies need sugar to obtain a fudge-like consistency.  Consequently a brownie made with higher cocoa mass levels will be less fudge-like.
Nuts are delicious in brownies and many types work very well. In this particular brownie I used pre-toasted hazelnuts and candied orange peel.  A personal favorite, however choose a combination which is appealing and makes financial sense in your part of the world.

<title>Chocolate Dipped Cashews</title>
<description>

Top cancer researchers in the world agree that step number one in avoiding cancer is a healthy lifestyle which includes a healthy diet. Some fruits and vegetables are true winners in terms of anti-cancer containing compounds as well as some nuts.  A nut which stands above all others in terms of anti-cancer compounds is the cashew.  Not particularly used a lot in Western style baking and confectionary, partly because it is expensive and partly because it does not have the delicious aroma of hazelnuts or almonds. Two good reasons indeed why the cashew has been sitting in the background.
For this particular confection I wanted to keep the healthy compounds and oils of the cashews intact and did not toast and or caramelize the cashews. Neither did I want to make a toasted cashew paste and use it as a filling or mix the cashews in a delicious caramel or ganache. What I wanted to make is a simple and healthy snack, good for our children, the ones we love and  ourselves.

Chocolate dipped cashews




17 oz
Dark chocolate couverture
500 g



12 oz
Non salted non roasted cashews
360 g

































 

Crystallize or temper the chocolate couverture. Spread approximately one eight of the tempered chocolate on a parchment or acetate sheet. Keep the remaining chocolate in temper by placing it in a microwave oven for a few seconds.
Cut the chocolate as soon as it has set in squares 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm (0.5 inch)
Pipe a few drops of tempered chocolate on each chocolate square and place two cashews on each.
Dip each cashew assembly into tempered chocolate and place on a parchment lined sheet.
Decorate with edible gold leaf if desired.

<title>Coffee Extract</title>
<description>

Most would agree that the aroma of high quality coffee is simply magnificent. Even people who are not fond of drinking coffee tend to like its scent.  Desserts made with coffee extract have an aura of luxury with at the same time being uplifting. Too bad that so many of the coffee extracts available on the market today, taste more like burnt caramel than actual coffee.
To make your own you coffee extract you will need good quality coffee, some artisan coffee merchants make outstanding coffee and then certainly some large companies do as well. There is an amazing Belgian coffee which is rather difficult to purchase in many parts of the world and another favorite of mine is Italian Kimbo, Gold Espresso.  These coffees (Or others, I assume there some good ones in your area) will make great tasting homemade coffee extract which will flavor your desserts to a higher level.
Homemade coffee extract | Extrait de Café
Yield: 8 oz | 240 gram



 
2 oz
Invert sugar
60 g


 
16 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
480 g


 
8 oz
Boiling water
240 g


 
4 oz
Ground Espresso Coffee (such as Kimbo)
120 g


 
 
 
 


 
1
Split vanilla bean
1


 
 
 
 



 

In a small saucepan bring the invert sugar to a boil. In small increments add the granulated sugar while stirring with a heat resistant spatula or wooden spoon. Once the previous added amount is melted add another small amount. Stir to a golden caramel. (Cook slightly darker than the photo).
Deglaze the caramel with the boiling water, add the coffee grounds and the vanilla bean. Return to a boil.
Remove from heat and cover with plastic. Allow to mature for 24 hours.
Strain using cheesecloth and a chinois.

<title>Star Anise Nougatine in Chocolate</title>
<description>

Star anise nougatine enrobed in chocolate certainly belongs to a selection of finer style Belgian chocolates.  Too bad that chocolates made with nougatine can be rather difficult to find, unquestionably it is a product which requires attention to detail. Since the confection featured here does not contain a cream, ganache or other typical filling, it is not a true “Praline” or “Belgian style chocolate”. Essentially it is a chocolate bar which contains a sheet of nougatine.  Delicious nevertheless and it has the enormous benefit of having long shelf life.
The nougatine recipe below is made without corn syrup or glucose. Although more affected by humidity, it does provide an incomparable caramel flavor. In “On Baking” a recipe for nougatine (pg 734) can be found using only glucose and fondant. Such combination is excellent for use in showpieces or for pieces which require long conservation or when working in a humid environment.
When using star anise in nougatine it is important to use invert sugar, without it the nougatine can quickly crystallize when the star anise is added, turning it into a disappointing result.  Remember that nougatine requires cooking the sugar to a perfect caramel and adding flawlessly toasted almonds. Dairy or cocoa butter is added at the end. Dairy butter provides the best flavor but cocoa butter works best in high humidity kitchens.  For further tips and ideas on nougatine you may want to read another article on nougatine on my site.

 
Star Anise Nougatine




2 oz
Invert sugar
60 g



9 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
270 g



4 oz
Toasted almonds
120 g



1 tsp
Star anise, ground
2 g









¾
Unsalted butter
20 g



pinch
Fleur de sel
pinch



 

Set aside a silpat and a rolling pin. If using a wooden rolling pin, butter it lightly. Not necessary if using a silicone rolling pin. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C)
In a saucepan bring the invert sugar to a boil, add a few tablespoons of the listed sugar and stir to melt the sugar (Do not allow to caramelize at this point). Add a few more tablespoons of sugar and stir until melted again. Continue with slowly adding larger amounts of sugar. Do not vigorously stir at any point.
Cook to a golden caramel stirring gently. Remove from heat, immediately add the toasted almonds, star anise, butter and fleur de sel. Stir to combine with a heat resistant or wooden spatula.
 Scrape the nougatine onto the silpat. Let sit for a few moments and then start gently rolling the nougatine into a thin sheet about the thickness of 3 stacked credit cards.
If the nougatine hardens before it is sufficiently thin, keep it on the silpat and place it in the oven to slowly soften. Press with a finger to check if it is soft enough and then roll once more.
Cut into shapes which will fit your chocolate molds and allow to cool.
Pour tempered chocolate into molds, allow the chocolate to nearly set, place a piece of nougatine in the mold.
Cover with chocolate and remove excess. Remove when chocolate has retracted from mold.

<title>Homemade Baking Powder</title>
<description>

 
All of us have tasted baked products which had a chemical soapy flavor with hints of bitterness, sourness and sulfur. Usually this problem occurs when relative high amounts or a certain type of baking powder is used. In muffins that contain lots of spices or other additions, it is logically harder to detect these undesired flavors. However, with many years of working with students, I have discovered that some people are very sensitive to the residual flavor of chemical leaveners and will even identify them in complex flavored muffins and cakes.  I have found that using homemade baking powder can provide better tasting results, especially in products that contain rather simple and fewer ingredients.  For example in certain scones, American style breakfast biscuits, French Sablé Breton (Breton shortbread) etc…. using a little too much baking powder or the wrong type can result in unsatisfactory results.
Homemade baking powder can be made by combining baking soda* with cream of tartar **. Certainly you may know that bicarbonate of soda is used to treat heartburn or acid indigestion and cream of tartar is a byproduct of wine making. Partly what sets this formula apart is that it does not contain one or both of the following chemicals often found in commercial baking powder:  Sodium aluminum sulfate and monocalcium phosphate.
An important thing to remember is that the recipe below for homemade baking powder is “single acting”. Therefore products need to be baked as soon as they are made, especially in moist batters such as muffins and certain cakes. In my testing, a wait time of 60-90 minutes before products with low moisture (breakfast biscuits, Sablé Breton) were baked, showed no difference in activity and rise compared to  products which were immediately baked.  Purchased double acting baking powder has the advantage that products can be frozen and baked later.
*Also known as:  bicarbonate of soda (Alkali) or sodium bicarbonate.
** Also known as potassium bitartrate or potassium hydrogen tartrate

Note: This recipe for baking powder performs very well, in your recipes use the same amount as you would if using purchased baking powder or double acting baking powder. You may even consider using slightly less of this blend compared to purchased baking powder.

<title>Coconut Sablée | Shortbread</title>
<description>

Every Pastry Chef I know always gets this question” What’s your best or favorite dessert?” I find this very hard to answer. Each dessert has its own sensation and to pinpoint the absolute best or favorite of your repertoire is nearly impossible.  How do you compare a croissant aux chocolat to a brownie with toasted hazelnuts? Or tender Brioche to crepes filled with flambéed pineapple? They can all be perfect. One thing that we do have is our favorite base dough, batters, creams etc. Our great performers in taste, texture, how it bakes….For me, one of these favorites is coconut sablée. I adore its texture,flavor, its versatility and simply how people respond to it…



 
Coconut Sablée | Coconut Shortbread
 




1 lb 1 oz
Unsalted premium butter, soft
500 g



7 oz
Powdered sugar
210 g



2 tsp
Vanilla extract
10 ml



1 ½ tsp
Salt
6 g



3
Egg yolks
3









7 oz
Desiccated / macaroon coconut
210 g









1 lb 2 oz
Pastry flour
540 g

























































1.            Mix the soft butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt until well combined but not until light and creamy.
2.            Add the yolks one at a time waiting for previous added amount to be fully incorporated. Add the macaroon coconut and mix to combine.
3.            Add the flour in one step and mix until just combined. Chill for at least one hour. The best flavor will be obtained by allowing the dough to mature 1-2 days in the refrigerator before rolling and baking.
4.            Roll the dough 0.13 inches (3.5 mm) thick and cut in desired size squares. Bake at 350°F (180°C) until light golden.
5.            When cooled dip into tempered chocolate couverture (80% milk chocolate couverture + 20% dark couverture 56%) .

<title>White Chocolate Mousse</title>
<description>

White chocolate mousse can be pleasing provided it is combined with bitter, tart, fruits, spices (including spicy) components.  In desserts I prefer to keep white chocolate mousse at 50-60% of the total dessert volume.  More than this amount and our guest may have a hard time finishing the dessert or simply be bored.
In this particular dessert the white chocolate mousse is harmonized with coffee. Above the layer of the white chocolate mousse is a layer of cold brewed coffee gelée and topped with a caramel dipped profiterole filled with espresso flavored pastry cream.  Chocolate sauce and cocoa nibs to finish.

If you would use this mousse in a verrine, gelatin will not be a necessary ingredient, used for an entremet, add gelatin or cocoa butter to make it possible to cut into desired shapes.

<title>A Sincere Thank You</title>
<description>
 
 

This past Saturday night we were treated by seeing both John Legend and Sade live in concert. When I see amazing artists at work, whether they are musicians, fine furniture makers, chefs….something about their work always touches the very core of me. It’s what they do and how they do it, what moves me very deep inside. While watching, I catch myself with my head slightly tilted and with a smile on my face, the way we look at a newborn baby.  Many true artist and us chefs, do what we do because we simply love our profession.  We love to create and ensure that someone’s wedding, birthday, anniversary or their chocolate croissant is simply perfect. For us, money was never a motive, it always is about our creations and ensuring that someone receives joy from them.  Till this day, I still vividly remember where and when we had delicious meals and desserts, I am thankful not only for the meal itself but also, for the enduring memory. I remembered it because it was special, just like I remembered watching Seal, who made that particular night in August extraordinary.
Every day, thousands of you from around the world visit my site and I would like to sincerely thank you, for sharing my passion and for your work, which brings joy and lasting memories to the people who live near you. Maybe one day, when I am working or on vacation in your country, I will have the pleasure of tilting my head, smile and be touched, because I am eating a meal or dessert, made by you.
Could I thank you in advance for that memory?

<title>Chocolate Gelato</title>
<description>

In most parts of the world vanilla is the most sold ice cream flavor and chocolate second.  Indeed a very good reason to have chocolate gelato in your dessert repertoire. If you open our freezer at home, you will usually find chocolate and pistachio gelato.
For chocolate gelato I prefer not to use egg yolks as these can hinder the pure and true chocolate flavor.  However, when you do not use egg yolks, an ice cream stabilizer is needed to ensure a smooth emulsion. In chocolate gelato and many of my other chocolate preparations, I use a small amount of coffee extract to enhance the chocolate flavor.  It is no secret that all chocolate manufactures use either real or artificial vanilla extract in their chocolate because it makes it more delicious. To make chocolate gelato I like to add vanilla (even though it is already present in the chocolate) to complete the flavor.
 
Chocolate Gelato
 










1 quart 3 oz
Milk
1 Lit



3 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar

Pour milk in a saucepan and heat to 85°F (30°C). Combine the sugar and stabilizer very well and whisk into the milk. Split and add the vanilla bean. Whisk in the milk powder and invert sugar and heat to 183°F (82°C). Add the coffee extract and a pinch of salt. Set aside for 5 minutes.
Pour onto the (Chopped) chocolate and use an immersion blender to homogenize the mixture.
Allow to mature for 4 hours minimum or overnight before churning.
When churned spread into desired thickness on a pre-chilled silpat lined sheet pan and freeze overnight. Cut into desired size and place on a bed of chopped pistachios.
Decorate with mango sauce and chocolate caramel tuile.

<title>Fig Tart</title>
<description>

Figs are at their best when enhanced with recognizable but non overpowering flavors. For many fig varieties, I like to use mascarpone or a white chocolate cream, which improves the delicate sweetness of the fig and consequently increase its flavor.  Figs love to be in company of honey, white chocolate, Rum, Amaretto, mascarpone, oranges, toasted almonds, Port….
The miniature figs I used here were grown in Texas and given to me by Marcel, a great student of mine.

White Chocolate and Orange Cremeux
Yield: 10-12 tart shells










8 oz
Whipping cream
240 g



8 oz
Milk

2-3



9 oz
White chocolate
270 g



2 oz
Candied orange peel
60 g















0.5 oz
Grand Marnier (optional)
15 g









 

Pay close attention to the method and temperatures to avoid a disappointing result.
Bring the cream, milk and vanilla bean to a boil in a small saucepan. Meanwhile in a bowl, whisk the egg yolks smooth and very rapidly whisk in the honey.
Pour a quarter of the boiling cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture and whisk quickly. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the heated cream and on low heat stir the mixture to 183⁰F (81⁰C) while CONSTANTLY stirring using a rubber spatula. Remove from heat and pour into another bowl to stop the cooking process.
Add the bloomed gelatin. Stir in the chopped chocolate. Chop the candied orange peel and add along with Grand Marnier.
Set and stir over ice to 40°F (4°C). Pour into prebaked tart shells and allow to set in a refrigerator.
Decorate with figs and finish with neutral glaze.

<title>Marshmallow | Raspberry</title>
<description>
 

The entire meringue family is very intriguing to me. Whether it is baked French style meringue layered into an entremet or an Italian Style meringue, frosted onto an ice cream cake, I am captivated by its versatility. Meringue is very adaptable indeed. Take for example Italian Meringue, used in mousses for creating an unequaled richness without adding fat, or used for piping onto countless desserts. When we simply add gelatin to Italian Meringue we have a confection popular the world over named marshmallow. Many people appreciate well made marshmallow, it’s delicate and light and at the same it time feels very rich and decadent on the human tongue.
Making confections with marshmallow and incorporating it into certain desserts is something I am very fond of. However, it is important to cut the sweetness of the marshmallow somehow.  This can easily be achieved by dipping it into chocolate which happens to be a sublime complement.
The raspberry marshmallows featured here are placed on a prebaked chocolate sablée square which adds a delicious texture. To ensure that the raspberry flavor is not overshadowed by the chocolate, it is dipped in chocolate couverture containing 58% cocoa mass.

<title>Fruit tarts</title>
<description>

A good tart shell, good cream and good fruit make one delicious dessert.  Although good hazelnut dough can be very delicious for a fruit tart, my favorite dough remains coconut shortbread tart dough.  It is one I use for lime and lemon tarts and certain petit four.
It has been my experience that many people in the United States are only mildly impressed with pastry cream, therefore for most tarts, I select either a cremeux or a cream flavored with fruit purees. For this particular mixed fruit tarts I used the refreshing and always delicious passion fruit cream.

<title>Black Forest</title>
<description>

Whether cream, chocolate, Kirsch and cherries are composed into a frozen dessert or plated (as shown here) they always please. Throughout my work, I have always been interested in discovering new flavor combinations, but at the same time I have always carefully studied the classics to discover what made them enduring.

 
Some fruits can even be more delicious when heated or sautéed and cherries belong exactly to this family. Flambéed cherries on gelato or served with panna cotta is simply perfection.
When I select a type of chocolate cake for black forest I make sure that it can be properly moistened with Kirsch liquor syrup.  Certainly a chocolate genoise or a sponge cake can be used but using a chocolate cake rich in almonds add more finesse.
Assembly

Cut a piece of chocolate      cake into a desired shape. Moisten well with the Kirsch syrup.
Place a piece of panna      cotta on the cake and serve with flambéed cherries.

<title>Quick Lime Curd</title>
<description>

 
For plated desserts I very much make sure that the various elements are not too scattered, preventing the consumer of having to “work” at the dessert (Ensuring that every bite has a good balance). Most of us like desserts which are multi layered with zero effort during the consumption. For example take an éclair. The perfect layering and understated elegance is the reason why I believe it is a classic worldwide. Desserts in a glass (or verrine) can be perfectly balanced as well and are also very easy to consume. The components consisting of a little crunch, something soft, something smooth, textures of fruit, a touch of sorbet, all coming together in one and all the consumer has to do is dig in with a spoon. Another major benefit to a dessert in a glass is that the creams, curds etc it contains, can be made with none or little gelatin or other thickeners. It’s fair to say that everyone prefers soft, creamy fillings over firmer gelatinized ones.
This lime curd is one of my personal favorites. It does not require a long cooking time over a double boiler and has a silky smooth texture.

Assembly

Place a round disk of genoise or sponge cake on the bottom of the glass.
Moisten the cake generously with raspberry liquor flavored simple syrup.
Cover with a small amount of lime curd and sprinkle with fresh berries and sesame seed nou gatine.
Cover with remaining curd and allow to set for a few hours. Decorate with berries, sesame seed nougatine and raspberry sorbet.

Few desserts refresh and excite our taste buds as lemon sorbet.  Lemon is wonderful when paired within the citrus family but can be equally as delicious when harmonized with black or red currant, edible geranium, ginger, apricot, milk chocolate and others.  Ginger, edible geranium and other flowers or herbs are simply extracted into the sorbet base syrup.  All citrus including lemon and lime are always best when freshly squeezed.
Sometimes the difference between sorbet and sherbet are not clearly understood. It basically lies in dairy products, sorbet does not contain milk or cream while sherbet does.
When I make sorbet as a plated dessert I often keep the other components low or completely free of fat as well. I do this mainly because I believe that when people choose sorbet as their dessert choice, they oftentimes seek something easy and light to digest. On this plate in addition to the lemon sorbet I added apricot pate de fruit and a strip of Italian Meringue.

Lemon Sorbet | Lemon Sorbet with Rose Geranium
Yield: 10- 12 servings









22 oz
22 oz
Water
665 g


1 ½ Cup
12 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
360 g


2 teaspoons
2 tsp
Sorbet stabilizer (optional)
8 g


1/3 Cup
4 oz
Invert sugar
120 g


2 ¼ Cups
18 oz
Lemon juice
530 g








¼ cup
0.5 oz
Rose geranium (optional)
15 g


























 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 



 

Pour water in a saucepan. Sift together the sugar and stabilizer (If using) and whisk into the water. Add the invert sugar and bring to a full boil.
Add the rose geranium (if using) and cover with plastic film and allow the syrup to mature for 12-24 hours. (Maturing the syrup will result in a smoother sorbet which will develop fewer ice crystals during storing).
Strain the syrup and add the lemon juice, churn according to your machine.
Spread the sorbet on a pre-chilled and plastic lined hotel pan to desired depth.
Freeze until hard and cut into desired shapes.
Place on a plate and serve with apricot pate de fruit and a strip of Italian Meringue. Torch the meringue and serve.

<title>Opaline | Transparent Tuile</title>
<description>

For many desserts, Opaline also known as a transparent tuile can be an eye catching decoration. It is easy to make and it can be colored as well. Since the ingredients are basically like a lollipop, opaline can be flavored with herbs, spices, extracts etc.  Like most sugar products it is quickly affected by humidity and therefore it needs to be stored airtight with a desiccant.  To combat the humidity, I also make opaline with the addition of isomalt.
 
Opaline | Transparent tuile










6 oz
Fondant
180 g



3.5 oz
glucose
100 g
























































 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 



 
 

Heat the fondant and the glucose to a very pale golden color or 350°F (175°C).
Pour on a silpat and allow to cool.
Place the sugar pieces onto a parchment sheet and crush using a rolling pin into powder. (if desired crush in a food processor)
Sieve the powder over a stencil of choice onto a Silpat.
Place in a 350°F (175°C) oven until the opaline has melted. If desired curve the opaline into shapes.

<title>White Chocolate Cremeux</title>
<description>

If there is one ingredient which Pastry Chefs feel a bit uneasy about using in the pastry kitchen, it must be white chocolate. We know very well that many people consider white chocolate not real chocolate and most of us are not smitten with white chocolate the same way as we are with milk and or dark chocolate.  However, at times just a piece of good quality chocolate can be satisfying. To make a dessert containing white chocolate successful I like to incorporate several textures such as Gerbet macaron, Pate de fruit, streusel….Some fruits I like to harmonize with white chocolate include Red and black currants, raspberries, tart cherries and others.
Preparations containing white chocolate need to be made with a minimum of sugar or the result will be simply too sweet. Therefore white chocolate cannot be used the same way dark chocolate can. For example a dark chocolate mousse may contain a meringue while using a meringue in a white chocolate mousse would make it way too sweet.

In this white chocolate cremeux only a minimum amount of sugar is used to have a balanced level of sweetness.
White Chocolate Cremeux
Yield: 6-8 servings









1Cup
8 oz
Whipping cream
240 g


1 Cup
8 oz
Milk
240 g


½
½
Vanilla bean
½


5
5
Egg yolks
5


2 Tbsp
1 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
30 g








1
1
Gelatin leaf (optional) bloomed
1


9 oz
9 oz
White chocolate
270 g


1 Tbsp
0.5 oz
Kirsch (optional)
15 g














 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 



 

Pay close attention to the method and temperatures to avoid a disappointing result.
Bring the cream, milk and vanilla bean to a boil in a small saucepan. Meanwhile in a bowl, whisk the egg yolks smooth and very rapidly whisk in the sugar. Make sure no egg yolk and sugar lumps are still visible.
Pour a quarter of the boiling cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture and whisk quickly. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the heated cream and on low heat stir the mixture to 183⁰F (81⁰C) while CONSTANTLY stirring using a rubber spatula. Remove from heat and pour into another bowl to stop the cooking process. Add the bloomed gelatin leaf if using. (Using the gelatin will naturally provide a slight firmer setting)
Add the chocolate and using an immersion blender or whisk blend the mixture smooth. Add the liquor and pour into glasses and place covered in a refrigerator.
The cremeux will set in a few hours. Serve with sour cherry coulis, Gerbet macaroons, streusel and fresh cherries.

<title>Tuile Designs</title>
<description>

 
Certain plated desserts require a touch of elegance which can be achieved by a variety of means. One of them is a contemporary tuile décor. Easy and fast to make and well liked by our guest.
Getting It All Together!
Tuile decors will absorb humidity quickly, therefore it is important to make these daily or store them with a desiccant.  Another method is simply prepare the tuile batter a couple of times a week and store in the refrigerator. The batter can also be frozen.

Recipe tuile
 




4 oz
Unsalted butter, soft
120 g



4 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar   or powdered
120 g



4 oz
Egg whites (at room temperature)
120 g



1 teaspoon
Vanilla
5 g



1/8 teaspoon
Salt
1 g















4 oz
Pastry flour or all purpose
120 g
















































































 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 




Cream the butter. Add the sugar and cream well.
Add the egg whites one at a time waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated. Add vanilla and salt.
Fold in the flour.
Spread the tuile batter very thin using a stencil onto a Silpat. Bake at 400°F (200°C) until light golden.
Meanwhile bring to a boil a small amount of glucose.
Spread (in spots) a very thin amount of glucose over the still hot tuile. Return to the oven for a few minutes until the tuile is golden-brown and the glucose feels nearly dry.
Shape as desired.

<title>Arlettes</title>
<description>

One of the things I like to prepare with leftover puff pastry trimmings are arlettes. Their lightness pairs perfectly with gelato, sorbet or a good fruit soup/plate. While I am writing this, I have arlettes by my side but no gelato or sorbet, only good espresso, and I must say it is quite delicious as well.
Oftentimes I prepare arlettes without any additional flavors, where only the butter and caramel flavor takes the forefront. But I do like these when made with cardamom and lemon, flavors I find most irresistible when paired with butter and caramel notes.
Getting It All Together!
Although you can use newly prepared puff pastry, chilled leftover trimmings will do fine.

<title>Petit Four | Lemon</title>
<description>

 
Serving Petit fours are often more complicated than one would believe. How they will be served is just one of the issues. At a cocktail party where the guest usually have a beverage in one hand, it is important to keep in mind that they have little opportunity to fuss with forks, spoons, napkins etc. Having a guest reach into petit four which makes their fingers a sticky mess is not professional. Such items are best served on a spoon or specialty vessel. Flavor is also very important, during parties people often take a petit four from a platter without asking the server what flavor profile it is. Therefore selecting flavors which satisfy a broad audience is usually not a bad idea. Petit fours made with flavors which are unique or not appreciated by most can always be presented with a name card.
Preparing miniatures from classics is always a safe bet since people are familiar with them and know what to expect. One such is featured here as a lemon tart petit four made with a touch of candied orange peel.  A true classic which is still as delicious as it became popular in the 19th century.

Getting It All Together!
Recipe for the coconut tart dough: On Baking pg 389. Recipe for lemon curd: On Baking pg 503. For the miniature tart shells it is very important to roll the dough rather thin, 2 mm is a maximum. The coconut dough has a nice rise in the oven and making it any thicker makes for an unbalanced ratio of crust to filling. Tart shells can always be made and baked in advance and be frozen. When ready to fill place in a preheated oven for a few minutes to crisp up the shells.

Roll out the coconut tart dough and cut circles slightly larger than the tart shells. Press the dough into the shell and prick with a fork.
Bake in a 375°F (190°C) oven until light golden.
When cooled sprinkle a few pieces of candied orange peel on the bottom of each tart shell. Fill with the lemon curd. Let cool.
Pipe Italian Meringue on the surface and brown with a torch. Decorate with candied orange peel or as desired.

<title>Mango Cremeux</title>
<description>

Key to any good dessert is balance of ingredients. Using too much of any component can make any dessert unpleasant to eat. Unless of course if you particularly love a certain component. Take for example this individual Mango tart. The ratio of this light and delicate Breton Shortbread is rather high to the ratio of the Mango cremeux. Some will feel that the balance is lovely while others may prefer more cremeux. Neither is particularly wrong, it is a matter of personal preference. What we certainly all can agree on is that an overly thick and hard tart crust is always unpleasant.
What is nice about this dessert is that it is rather quick to make. The Breton shortbread is pressed or piped into silforms and baked. Once baked and cooled they can be filled with a variety of fillings.


Getting It All Together!
The Breton Shortbread is best baked the day of serving. Certainly the filled silforms can be frozen and defrosted later for bake off. The mango cremeux can be made a day in advance and right before using being mixed using an immersion blender or high speed blender for optimum smoothness.

<title>Inverse Puff Pastry</title>
<description>

Pastry Chefs have several options when it comes down to making Puff pastry and oftentimes will prepare the type which they are most familiar with or which they most prefer. Personally I have found that all types can produce excellent results when the procedure is properly followed. However based upon my research I do believe that puff pastry can differ in mouth feel. Some feel drier and some feel more buttery. Improperly made puff pastry can feel hard even though it is flaky. One thing for sure is that inverse puff pastry (Inversed or inverted puff pastry) bakes rather light and produces very flaky results. For filled applications such as apple turnovers or Pithivier I do prefer to use inverse puff pastry, reason being that it stands up real well to the steam/humidity produced from the fillings and consequently leaves virtually no traces of unbaked dough.
 
When preparing inverse puff pastry it is necessary to work in a cool kitchen. Instead of the butter block being wrapped by the dough it is enveloping it, thus a warm kitchen makes it nearly impossible to obtain good results. For the readers in the United States it is important to make this dough with butter labeled “European style” This type of butter contains less water and will produce better results. In other countries select butter with high fat content, this type of butter should also feel very firm in the refrigerator. Ghee or clarified butter is not recommended as some water is necessary to produce the flaky layers. Flour strengths differ around the world and thus additional flour may be needed to make the dough firm. Firm dough will create very flaky results.

<title>Strawberry Tarts with Cassis Cremeux</title>
<description>

Lately I have been preparing quite a few tarts made with puff pastry. Sure, in a way somewhat old fashioned and certainly far more difficult to handle if compared to shortbread style tart dough. However, I think that we can all agree that most people find pure butter puff pastry simply irresistible. It is one of my personal favorites as well, the flakes, the way it crumbles and then melts away, the amazing buttery flavor….. just extraordinary.

Certainly puff pastry does have disadvantages. Preparing the dough itself is a lengthy process and it is only wonderful the day it was baked. In case of puff pastry tart shells, they take a lot longer to prepare if compared to shortbread type tart shells. Simply the baking process takes a long time ….baking it blind, removing the paper and weights, pricking the dough, returning to the oven and ensuring that the dough is well pricked…..Another key element is that puff pastry is can be difficult in terms of giving the final product a contemporary edge.  It is unfortunate because puff pastry is really like no other.  Oftentimes I use puff pastry in plated dessert elements, where it is a little easier for me to give it a fresh, contemporary feel.

For the filling of a strawberry tart I love black currant (Cassis) cremeux. It comes from my parents who truly do grow the most delectable strawberries. Never have I had tasted such strawberries. One would believe the strawberries have been perfectly crossed with black currants. It is that exact flavor I am trying to copy which nature did so perfectly.

Getting It All Together!
At this time I have not featured an article on my site on making puff pastry so I must refer you to On Baking or your favorite recipe. Certainly prepare the puff pastry and perform the laminating the day before rolling the dough for the tart shells. Prepare the black currant cremeux once the tart shells are baked. As soon as the cremeux is made pour it in the baked crust and refrigerate. This will ensure a tart with a perfect “set” cremeux.
Recipe Cremeux




8  oz
Black currant puree
240 g



3.5 oz
Eggs
100 g



3 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar

Set up a Bain Marie.
In a non reactive saucepan heat black currant puree to 195°F (90°C).
In a bowl whisk the eggs and sugar very well until no strings remain. Temper the egg mixture with all the heated puree. Place the bowl over the Bain Marie and stir constantly using a rubber spatula to 203°F (95C°). Remove from heat.
Stir in the bloomed gelatin and cool over an ice bath to 120°F (50°C). Stir in the butter. Use an immersion blender for optimum smoothness. Pour into a prebaked tart shell.

<title>Kouing Aman</title>
<description>

It is fair to say that most people find a perfect pure butter croissant or a delectable apple turnover simply irresistible. It is partly about the texture, the buttery flakes, the aroma and the desire for more.  Like nearly everyone, I am also a huge aficionado of Palmiers. To me, Palmiers caramelized crust and its buttery crisp layers are nothing less than a feast for the mouth.
Kouing Aman is a little of all of the above. It can be described as a crisp caramelized shell with flakey tender buttery layers with a most satisfying flavor.

For laminating dough in school we use a machine, but for a “how to roll by hand session” I have found that Kouing Aman is a perfect candidate. This because it does not have to be (although it can) as perfectly rolled as let’s say puff pastry.
Getting It All Together!
From start to finish it is best to allow about 6 hours to prepare  Kouing Aman.
Recipe Kouing Aman
Yield: 10




2 lb 3 oz

<title>Valentine Dessert</title>
<description>

Valentine menus tend to be filling and oftentimes rich. For such occasions I like to select a dessert which is either light or is very strong in flavor. This lemon and passion fruit cream does the trick. If desired serve with raspberry, champagne and rose or blackberry sorbet.
For the heart I made a lemon cream with a hint of passion fruit and poured it in a heart shaped silform and placed it in the freezer. Unmold and place it on a bed of baked meringue sticks. For the sauce I used a caramel passion fruit sauce without the use of pectin (On Baking pg 548). To the sauce I added 2 oz (60 g) of mango puree to give it additional body.

Lemon and Passion Fruit Cream
This cream is soft and creamy, for large functions where the dessert has to be out of the refrigerator for a while, add one bloomed sheet of gelatin before adding the butter.









½ Cup
(4 oz)
Extra fine granulated sugar   (A)
120 g


¾ Cup
(4 oz)
Lemon juice
120 ml


¼ Cup
(2 oz)
Passion fruit juice
60 g


4
(4)
Large eggs
4


½ Cup
(4 oz)
Extra fine granulated sugar   (B)
120 g








2 Sticks
(8 oz)
Unsalted butter, soft
240 g








































In a non reactive saucepan bring to a boil the sugar (A), lemon and passion fruit juice.
In a separate bowl whisk the eggs for 30 seconds. Add sugar (B) and whisk vigorously for 1 minute. Pour one fourth of the boiled mixture to the eggs while whisking rapidly. Pour the tempered eggs into the remaining boiled mixture and whisk until the mixture comes to a rapid boil and bubbles thick like lava. Ensure that the mixture boils as this ensures a proper “set” from the eggs.
Let cool to 125°F (53C°). Stir in the SOFT butter. If any butter lumps remain, heat lightly in a microwave oven.
Pour the cream immediately into the heart shaped silicone molds and place in the freezer.
When frozen unmold.


1. Pipe tempered chocolate into a straw which has been closed at one end with plastic food wrap. After setting push out the chocolate using a wooden skewer.

1. Spread tempered chocolate on a plastic sheet and one the chocolate has firmed like “leather” cut into point of arrow and wing. Attach to arrow using tempered chocolate.

<title>Valentines Petit Four Sec</title>
<description>

For the weeks leading up to the day of love, I am sharing some of the things which I find of interest and which could be possibilities to serve on or before Valentine.   The first in the collection is a shortbread finished with raspberry jam, almond macaronade and chocolate. It is an excellent petit four sec which perfectly pairs with espresso or earl Grey tea.

Getting It All Together!
1. Roll out coconut shortbread (or use hazelnut shortbread) (recipe for coconut shortbread is in On Baking pg 389) and cut into hearts. Bake at 375°F (180°C) until a hint of color appears.
2. Pipe a border of Almond macaronade (recipe On Baking pg 343) on the edge.
3. Fill with raspberry jam and bake until golden.
4. Once cooled, temper couverture chocolate. If desired thin the chocolate with 5 % grapeseed oil for easier flowing.
5. Pipe the chocolate into the center of the heart and sprinkle with cocoa nibs.

<title>Cheesecake made with SteviaCane</title>
<description>

At times a pastry chef has to make desserts which address certain dietary needs. Sometimes the product needs to be without gluten, lactose, salt or it may require having high fiber content. Some people chose or by doctor’s order need to reduce their sugar intake.
Making ingredient changes in desserts can be easy or challenging. Something easy for example is preparing lactose free pastry cream. All we have to do is switch the dairy milk to soy or almond milk and we obtain good results.  Recently I have done some research with an all natural product named SteviaCane, a combination of sugar and Stevia. It allows us to make desserts with half the amount of sugar, but with the same sweetening level outcome. If a recipe calls for let’s say 1 lb (450 g) of sugar you would only use 0.5 lb (225g) of SteviaCane.  For people who want to reduce their sugar and consequently their calorie intake, SteviaCane is a great solution.
When working with SteviaCane I usually make a few adjustments to the recipe in order to obtain professional and good final results. Remember, by using SteviaCane instead of sugar, we are essentially reducing the sugar by 50% and thus also reducing the moistness level naturally provided by sugar. Therefore in order to produce good cakes, cookies, pie fillings etc it is important to bring in moisture in some other ways.  Some moisturizing agents which have proven to be very effective include buttermilk, apple sauce and prune or raisin puree. If a recipe calls for 1 lb (450 g) of sugar, I would use 8 oz (225 g) SteviaCane and about 4-6 oz (120-180g) of any of the above mentioned moisturizers.  If making a pound cake, I would use buttermilk, for brownies I prefer raisin puree, for apple pie, I use apple sauce. Like everything else, best results are obtained by testing and fine tuning.
For this cheesecake I found that simply adding milk was the best option to obtain a silky smooth texture.

Cheesecake with SteviaCane



4- eight oz packs
2 lb
Philadelphia Cream cheese
900 g


1 Cup
5 oz
SteviaCane
150 g


4

1 Cup
7 oz
Sour cream

0.5 oz
Vanilla extract
15 ml


2-3 Tbsp
1.5 oz
Amaretto
45 ml


4 Tbsp
1 oz
Flour
30 g
































































Allow the cream cheese to come to room temperature before mixing. On low speed blend the cream cheese and SteviaCane until blended and no lumps remain.
Add the eggs one at a time waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated. Scrape bowl often between mixing.
Gradually add the sour cream and scrape, pour in the milk gradually. Add the vanilla extract and Amaretto. Pour the batter into silicone domes or finish as a standard cheesecake.
Bake in a 325F (160C ) oven using a water bath. Bake until the cakes no longer trembles, about 40 minutes for small domes and about 60-70 minutes for a large cake.
Chill and finish as desired. Picture shows the cheesecakes being coated with Cocoa gelée (see On Baking

<title>Gâteau Ferrini</title>
<description>

Some of the finest cakes in the pastry shop oftentimes contain almonds. Just to name a few: Financier, Dacquoise, Pain de Genes, and Joconde…. Indeed they are some of a pastry chef most beloved cake layers to work with.  For this particular gâteau I used biscuit joconde as it allows me to moisten it with liquor syrup. Some cake layers such as Financier does not need moistening and dacquoise would be ruined if it was.

In this specific gateau, the multiple layers of Joconde moistened with Grand Marnier and layered with Ganache and grapefruit marmalade create a very fresh, slightly bitter and yet at the same time, a tender sweetness. At times, I like to serve this composition as a plated dessert accompanied by pink peppercorn chocolate sorbet and as a smaller version as Petit Four.



Getting It All Together!
The biscuit Joconde can be made days ahead and be frozen. At this time I am working on a recipe different than the one featured in On Baking, as soon as I have created a satisfactory result, I will publish it here. Not that I am not happy with the recipe featured in the book, it’s just that I cannot feature it on my site. Since American sheet pans are slightly larger than European ones I increased the ingredients for the Joconde recipe of On Baking by 20%.


Gâteau Ferrini
Yield: 3 gâteaux, each serving 6-8

Cut a full sheet joconde      crosswise into 4 equal strips. Moisten one strip with Grand Marnier syrup.
Spread a very thin layer      of grapefruit marmalade on the moistened layer. Cover with another strip      of joconde and moisten. Spread a thin layer of ganache on the surface.      Repeat the entire steps with joconde, grapefruit marmalade and ganache. Place in a      freezer.
Warm up a small amount of      Ganache to make it perfectly fluid, about 120°F (50°C ) pour onto the      surface to make it perfectly even. Cut into desired size.  Cover with sugared almonds and spray the      almonds with chocolate. Decorate as desired.

Ganache:




16 oz
Heavy cream (40% fat)
480 g



2.5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
75 g



5 oz
Invert sugar
150 g



1 lb 2 oz
Chocolate 58-63% cocoa
540 g



4 oz
Unsalted butter
120 g


















































































Bring to a boil the cream, sugar and invert sugar.
In a small bowl place the chocolate pistols or chocolate chopped in small pieces.
Pour the boiled mixture into the chocolate and using an immersion mixer (stick mixer) blend to a smooth mixture. Ensure to keep the mixer head completely submerged to prevent air being incorporated into the ganache.
Add the butter and blend smooth.

Note: Certainly the ganache can also be made by adding the cream in about 5 increments while stirring with a rubber spatula in a circular fashion.
Sugar coated almonds:




4 oz
Sliced almonds
120 g



1.25 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
40 g



.33 oz
Egg white
10 g



½ tsp
Vanilla bean paste
2.5 g
























































































Combine the ingredients and scatter on a parchment lined sheet pan.
Place in a 350°F (180°C) oven until golden brown. Store airtight.

<title>Red Grapefruit Marmalade</title>
<description>

It‘s no wonder that the botanical name for grapefruit is Citrus Paradisi. The scent, the flavor, the cholesterol lowering properties and the endless list of healthy attributes make it a fruit straight from paradise indeed.
Grapefruit is one of the fruits I love to use in desserts since it brings an unmatched flavor to countless desserts. The juxtaposition of sweet and tart in desserts is high on my list of importance and grapefruit is one that delivers. Rose, ginger, mango , Grand Marnier and certainly chocolate can be wonderful pairings with grapefruit.
Whenever I use citrus peel such as for grapefruit marmalade, I only use organic non treated grapefruits. I still do not know if conventional treated citrus fruit is ok to use, but I do know that they are treated with chemicals and often times lac resins. It is just not the type of thing I like to feed my wonderful engine. If anyone has scientific non partisan data on whether using non organic citrus peel is safe to use, I would really love to hear.



For many, marmalades or jams can be a little scary since they may not set if not properly prepared. For success it is important to stay with the listed recipe as the ingredients and their ratio play a vital role. If for example the sugar is reduced then the cooking time will increase resulting in cooked flavor. (Although I must say, for certain jams or marmalades I do reduce the sugar and I obtain proper setting by using additional pectin.) Certain fruits, such as the citrus family contain a good amount of the setting agent pectin, which naturally plays a very important role. Some fruit such as strawberries contain little pectin. For such fruit, specific cooking methods and or pectin additions are necessary for brilliant results. For many of my marmalades I like to make my easy to make “pectin cocktail” by simply simmering some non peeled Granny Smith apples in water. Once the apples are super tender I mash them and pour in a fine mesh sieve. The obtained juice is what I use to assist the gelling of my marmalades.
Getting It All Together!
Combining the peel, segments, sugar, apple juice and lemon juice has to be done a day before cooking the marmalade. This will ensure a pleasant (not too hard) peel and a perfect setting marmalade.

Grapefruit marmalade




24 oz
Grapefruit, organic
720 g



16 oz
Extra fine Granulated sugar
480 g



1 oz
Lemon juice
30 g



2 oz
Apple juice, see recipe below
60 g
























































































Wash and peel the grapefruit with a vegetable peeler. Cut the peel into small pieces.
With a sharp knife cut away all the white part exposing the flesh. Cut along each membrane to remove the segments.  Cut the segments into 4 pieces. Combine the chopped peel and segments. Scale to obtain 1 lb (480 g)
Place in a non reactive bowl and add the lemon juice and apple juice cover with plastic food wrap and store in the refrigerator for 12-24 hours.
Bring the mixture to a boil and then turn to simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and pour thru a chinois or fine sieve. Do not throw away the fruit meat or the liquid! Set aside the fruit meat.
Combine liquid and sugar and boil without stirring to 230°F (110°C), at this temperature add the fruit meat and bring to a simmer. Stir to 224.5°F (107°C).  Remove from heat.
Pour in sterilized jars and cover using your preferred method.


Pectin rich apple juice for marmalade and Jam preparations
Yield: 5 oz (150 ml)




8 oz
Granny smith apple, organic
8 oz



12 oz
Water
360 g




































































































Wash the apple, without peeling cut in 8 segments and place in a small saucepan.
Cover with water and simmer on low heat for 25 minutes.
Mash the apples using a potato masher.
Pour the puree into a chinois or fine meshed sieve and allow the juice to drip out the puree without stirring.
Freeze any unused juice for other uses.

<title>Lambic Raspberry Sorbet</title>
<description>

This past summer Lieve Blancquaert and her amazing crew came to Houston and filmed me nonstop for 4 days for an episode of her beautiful documentary, titled “Made in Belgium”. It’s a series of 8 shows, each featuring a chef who works somewhere in the world. Her program took her to South America, Africa, North America and Europe. The show truly is a work of art, not only is it brilliantly presented and filmed, it also shows an in depth view of the work and life of the particular chef featured. It is the type of quality television we all wished we had more off.
During the week of filming it seems like we had a thousand activities planned which kept me very busy and left me pretty much exhausted by the end of the week. Lieve is the type of person you just want to give your all, her skillful way of interviewing combined with her down to earth manner makes it just so. One of the perks I enjoyed was to see her at work when she was photographing people in extraordinary settings. Besides doing television work, Lieve is a magnificent award winning photographer whose work is sought after the world over.
For the “Made in Belgium” show they filmed a segment where we had friends over for dinner at our home and what better to serve than famous Belgian beef stew cooked in Belgian beer? For dessert I made a sorbet made from one of my top favorite beers “Lambic Framboise” A marvelous quality raspberry beer with a gorgeous bouquet made since….1559! I simply love the fact that this beer is available here in the America. Some people may not be aware of the fact that fruits and vegetables were used to make beers long before hops came into play.
Since I receive countless requests on how to make chocolate decorations here is one example. If you are a novice in chocolate work, I suggest you use dark couverture chocolate. It is a little easier to work with and is stronger. Make sure you read some of my articles on how to temper or crystallize chocolate here or consult “On Baking”. Use a pastry comb or adhesive spreader from the hardware store to “comb” the tempered chocolate onto acetate plastic.
Cheers!

Using a pastry comb, comb the tempered chocolate onto firm acetate plastic  into lines.


Bend the acetate and connect the ends with adhesive tape. Let sit for 5 minutes at room temperature and than place in a cool room or refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Carefully remove the adhesive tape and release the obtained chocolate rings. Place in a pattern of choice.

Pipe tempered chocolate in the center of the decoration (Not shown) to connect all the loops. Place a round chocolate cutout in the center to beautify.

<title>Macaron</title>
<description>

A fruit which never seems to escape my interest are cranberries. I adore them in savory applications as well as in desserts.  Their acidic bitterness is particularly welcome in desserts which are by nature sweet and are in dire need of a touch of balance. Think for example of wonderful baked meringue layered with cranberry marmalade and crème Chantilly. It’s a composition I often make for our guest since it is a house favorite.

This Holiday season I decided to fill some of my macarons with a cranberry ganache.  At times I make this specific ganache without any cream, however it is slightly smoother with the cream, so this is the one I share with you today. If you decide to use this ganache as a soft filling for something that will be refrigerated, I suggest reducing the chocolate by 30%. Cranberries are loaded with natural pectin and the ganache will set with very little chocolate. The amount of sugar seems rather high, but it is correct, cranberries are indeed very bitter and require a good amount of sugar.
Getting it all together!
Gerbet Macaron can easily be filled a day ahead of serving. In fact it allows the filling to make the center of the macaron extra tender.  Prepare the ganache a day ahead of using to ensure proper crystallization.
Cranberry Ganache

Bring the cranberries, whipping cream and sugar to a boil. Remove from heat and blend to a super smooth puree. If seeds remain, strain to remove. Return to heat and boil for 2 minutes.
Remove from heat and pour onto the chocolate in 3 increments. Stirring with a spatula to obtain a perfect emulsion. Cover and store at room temperature. Use the next day.

Note: See above article on reducing amount of chocolate in this ganache.

<title>Brioche</title>
<description>

Brioche with candied Buddha hand toasted hazelnuts
Good quality butter, a few ordinary ingredients and close attention to detail can make a most extraordinary brioche. The brioche I feature here is made with a sponge and therefore may not be as convenient to prepare, compared to a brioche where the dough is matured overnight in a refrigerator.
The mild lemony flavor of Candied Buddha hand in brioche is quite wonderful as it pairs with the butter flavor real well. Certainly Buddha hand can be expensive or hard to find in some countries and therefore may have to be replaced with other fruits.

Getting it all together!
Allow nearly seven hours from start to finish for this particular brioche. The fermentation can be rather slow in the beginning but do not increase the amount of yeast. Make sure you do allow the time required for the sponge to develop. A sponge is essential and ensures proper yeast activity in a very rich (Butter and eggs) environment.
Brioche with candied Buddha hand
Yield: 6 loaves
For the sponge:




10 oz
Water
300 g



0.5 oz
Instant yeast
15 g



9 oz
Eggs
270 g



1oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
30 g



12 oz
Bread flour
360 g


















































































Bring the water to 100°F (37°C). Whisk in the yeast and the eggs. Add the sugar and flour and combine until no lumps remain.
Cover and set aside in a warm place until doubled, about 90-120 minutes.

Main dough ingredients:




0.5 oz
Instant yeast
15 g



10 oz
Eggs
300 g



2 lb 8 oz
Bread flour
1200 g



5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
150 g



3 oz
Invert sugar
90 g









1 oz
Salt
30 g









1 lb 6 oz
Unsalted butter, soft
660 g



12 oz
Candied Buddha hand, drained
360 g



12 oz
Hazelnuts, toasted
360 g



2 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
60 g








































To the fermented sponge add the instant yeast and eggs and combine well. Add the bread flour, sugar, invert sugar and salt and mix using a dough hook until the dough is elastic and forms a window.
Add the soft butter in 4-5 increments on low speed, waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated. Ensure that the dough does NOT exceed 78°F (26°C).
Add the candied Buddha hand and nuts and mix until just distributed.
Cover with plastic and allow the dough to ferment until doubled, about 60-80 minutes. Punch the dough and rest for 10 minutes.
For large Brioche molds weigh into 1 lb 4 oz (600 g) pieces for the loaves and 1.5 oz (45 g) for the center part. Make round.
Place in well buttered brioche pans and make a deep hole in the center. Place the small round in the hole. Place in a proof box until the loaves have 70% increased in size, about 60-80 minutes.
Brush with egg wash and bake in a 375°F (190°C) oven until thoroughly baked, about 42 minutes. Brioche will always obtain a dark crust, if a lighter crust is desired cover with aluminum foil near the end of baking.

<title>Candied Buddha’s Hand</title>
<description>

One of the most interesting looking fruits in our world is without a doubt Buddha’s hand or fingered citron. By now you probably know that I have not met a citrus that I do not like and Buddha’s hand is no exception.  Every year when these fruits become available I have an irresistible urge to incorporate them in desserts. The exquisite aromatic citrus along with a hint of Jasmine is a combination which is hard to resist. At times I will place one on our dinner table and skip the flowers.  In China, Buddha’s hand symbolizes long life and happiness. In Japan people will often bring a Buddha’s hand to people’s homes on New Years, as it is believed to present good fortune.  In our home it is a fruit I love to have as it very elegantly perfumes the air.

The interior flesh is spongy and very similar like the white pitch from other citrus but this one has absolutely no traces of bitterness. The fruit itself does not contain juice, so it does limit us in ways to use this fruit.   One of the things I prepare often with Buddha hand is a marmalade which I slightly dilute with Cointreau and serve with croissants or scones. It is very delicious.  Candying Buddha’s hand is also a great way to use this fruit, since it allows us to incorporate it in many ways.

Getting It All Together!
To candy Buddha’s hand, I prefer to remove a good amount of the white spongy part, not that it is bitter, I just prefer the peel more. Candied it will last for many weeks kept in the candying syrup in a refrigerator.

Candied Buddha’s Hand




24 oz
Water
720 ml



24 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
720 g



1
Buddha Hand, sliced
1



5 oz
Invert sugar
150 g



½ teaspoon
Vanilla bean paste
2.5 g


















































































Cut the fruit in slices and remove the majority of the white pith. Set aside.
In a saucepan bring the water and sugar to a boil. Add the fruit and the invert sugar and simmer on low until the white part is nearly translucent and the peel is tender, about 50 minutes.
Place in covered in a refrigerator.

Green Tea Rice Cream With Semi Candied Strawberries
Most countries in the world have some type of a desserts made with rice, often it is a type of pudding or cream.  When I was a lad, my Mom would make countless versions of rice pudding but the ones I remember most vividly, contained cinnamon, vanilla and raisins. To this day, I still like rice creams or puddings. They seem to have a sense of comfort to them without being loaded with fat.

In On Baking we have a recipe for Rice cream with cherry gelée which I habitually make during the summer time. It is refreshing and when piled with fresh pitted cherries it is irresistible. Whenever we prepare Asian style foods at the house, I like to end the meal with a dessert which perfectly flows with the food. One of these is a green tea rice pudding with semi candied strawberries, this is one of my favorite green tea combinations.
Getting It All Together!
Although you can cook the rice a day ahead, I do usually cook it the day I combine it with the other ingredients. Other good flavors to add to green tea rice cream without overpowering the green tea flavor is orange, lemon, grapefruit, calamansi, rose and cherries. For the chocolate decor, mix a desired amount of sifted matcha powder with tempered white chocolate. Once spread sprinkle with prebaked streusel and cut once the chocolate is set like leather.





Green Tea Rice Cream
Yield: about 8-10 servings




16 oz
Water

4 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
120 g



½ teaspoon
Vanilla bean paste
2.5 g









0.25 oz
Orange zest (Optional)

pinch
Salt
pinch



0.25 oz
Matcha-green tea powder
7.5 g



8 oz
Whipping cream
240 g



2 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar

In a saucepan bring the water to a boil and add the rice. Cover for 5 minutes and drain.
Bring the milk, sugar, vanilla, orange zest and the drained rice to a boil. Turn to a low simmer and cook until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender. (Additional moisture will be absorbed during cooling). Let cool to room temperature.
Mix the matcha powder with a very small amount of milk and fold into the rice.
Whip the whipping cream and sugar (B) to soft-medium and gently fold into the above.
Fill in glasses and serve with semi candied strawberries and raspberries.
Sprinkle the surface with baked crumble or streusel.

<title>Semi Candied Strawberries</title>
<description>

For certain desserts I like to use semi candied strawberries. The reason is twofold. One, the flavor is simply incomparable and two, when I make desserts which need to be frozen, semi candied strawberries survive freezing without a hitch.
It would be dishonest to say that semi candied strawberries are not sweet. They are, so when I use these I make certain they are combined with other ingredients which will balance their sweetness. For example, I like to mix semi candied strawberries with fresh raspberries, spoon it on gelato and give it a drizzle of raspberry infused-balsamic vinegar reduction.

Correctly made they are beautiful and if you are faced with strawberries that are disappointing, semi candy them to improve the flavor tremendously.
Getting It All Together!
Semi candied strawberries are quick to make and can be used a few hours after preparation or the following day.
Semi Candied Strawberries recipe

<title>Pumpkin Crème brûlée</title>
<description>

In many countries around the world American classics such as chocolate chip cookies, brownies, muffins and several others have become quite popular.  It would be interesting to know if in a decade or so pumpkin desserts will follow the same path. To be honest, the very first time I tasted pumpkin pie, I was immediately smitten. The whole thing reminded me of a dessert I grew up with in Belgium named Vlaai. Not exactly the same but it still reminds me of it, I call it pure home style unapologetic goodness.

During the Fall, in North America pumpkin pies are very popular and along with pecan pie and sweet potato pie, are served nearly everywhere on the Thanksgiving Holiday. For certain occasions when I need the dessert to be less home style I turn towards pumpkin crème brûlée. Similar ingredients just used in a different ratio.

One of the things I have discovered is that Fresh pumpkins can be tremendous in savory foods but when it comes down to desserts, it is a slightly different story. The leading canned pumpkin manufacturer in the United States has managed to perfect and grow a variety of pumpkins which sweetness, texture and color is ideal for desserts.   Thus I do not fuss with fresh pumpkins unless if I make pumpkin curry soup.
On the ratio of pumpkin to cream… when questioned, most people prefer a crème brûlée with a pumpkin flavor. If what you are looking for is more pumpkin and less crème flavor than I would decrease the cream and increase the pumpkin.
Getting It All Together!
Just as standard Crème brûlée this one can also be made a day or so ahead of time. For the décor use a pumpkin tuile and or caramelized pecans.

Whisk the yolks and add in the sugar, whisk until smooth but do not whip light and thick. (overwhipping creates a thick undesired foam layer on the brulees)
Add the pumpkin followed by all the remaining ingredients.
Pour in desired ramekins and place on a sheet or Hotel pan. Pour water in the pan ensuring that the ramekins are surrounded by water 2/3 deep.
Bake in a 325°F (160°C) oven until the center no longer trembles. Temperatures and time will depend on depth and type of ramekins used. Refrigerate.
To serve sprinkle the surface with granulated sugar and using a blow torch caramelize the sugar.

<title>Pumpkin Tuile – Pumpkin Lace Cookie</title>
<description>

Since I have a huge affinity towards desserts with pumpkin, I figured it was time to create a pumpkin tuile I could use with pumpkin desserts.  Certainly an orange or maple tuile for pumpkin desserts works fine, but since I already have recipes for such, it would not have had the challenge of testing and retesting this recipe until I had something I had envisioned.
Getting It All Together!
Like most tuiles or lace cookies this one also needs to be protected from humidity. Make the batter and whatever amount is not used place it in a refrigerator or freezer until next times use.

Pumpkin tuile
Note: Since a tuile needs very correct scaling this recipe only contains scaled and not measured amounts.

<title>Orange Ganache Tarts</title>
<description>

Whenever I make chocolate ganache tarts I am always afraid that they will be too rich. I always strive to reach a good balance in desserts and sometimes, I feel that ganache tarts can be over the top heavy. One way I like to cut the richness in ganache, is to replace part of the whipping cream with a fruit puree or juice. Not only can this provide an excellent flavor, but it can also add certain finesse. Some fruit purees naturally enhance the fruitiness of chocolate and really bring complexity of flavor.
In this particular instant I replaced part of the cream with concentrated orange juice. Concentrated orange juice? Sure, concentrated orange juice is made by means of using a vacuum and I prefer to use it over reducing orange juice. At times there exceptions! I do not recommend this ganache-as it is formulated, to be used as a large tart. The ganache is soft, even if refrigerated and these tarts are always best when removed from the refrigerator 45 minutes before being served. Thus cutting a large tart and hoping to obtain perfect slices may not become a reality.

These particular tarts were served at a dinner party we recently had and we served it with Clementine (used fresh juice!) and Mandarin Napoleon sorbet. Along with the sorbet, the richness of the tarts was tamed and it just became a luxurious dessert that everyone loved.
Getting It All Together!
The chocolate tart dough can be made weeks in advance and be stored in the freezer. Bake the tart shells the day of serving for optimum results. The ganache is best prepared fresh as it will be silky smooth. The recipe for the chocolate tart dough is in On Baking on page 390.

In a saucepan bring the concentrated orange juice, whipping cream and invert sugar to a boil.
Remove from heat and pour a third onto the chocolate, using a rubber spatula stir in a circular fashion. Repeat with another third and stir in a circular fashion to obtain an elastic nucleus. Add the remaining cream and repeat.
If desired add a touch of orange liquor.
In the tart shells place some chopped candied orange zest.
Pour the ganache into the tartlets and allow to firm in the refrigerator.

<title>Candied Orange Zest</title>

Candied Citrus Zest
For certain chocolates, filled croissant, and dessert in general I like to use candied orange peel. To make it properly and to ensure that the candied peel will keep, it takes about a week to prepare. A long process indeed, but the result is simply amazing. Dipped in bittersweet chocolate, candied orange peel is one of the most luxurious confections in the world. Whenever I am in Bruges I always visit an artisan chocolatier which makes delicious candied orange peel.

Making candied citrus zest as featured in this article, is a whole lot quicker and provides very good results. The main difference between the two is that candied orange peel is made from the entire peel, including the white bitter pith and candied orange zest is made from the outer layer only, the zest. For either one, I only use organic or non treated citrus fruit. It is nice to know that it is not difficult to find organic citrus which is not coated with waxes and treated with chemicals.
Candied citrus zest can be used in numerous ways, swirl it in gelato, spoon it on ice cream, mix it in sauces, mousses, use it to decorate petit fours, mix it into financier or other cake batters…….

Getting It All Together!
Candied citrus zest will last for many months in a well sealed container in the refrigerator or simply freeze it.

<title>Bavarian Cream | Pomegranate Violet</title>
<description>

To me, the beginning of the Fall season is always wonderful. Outdoor temperatures are simply amazing and fruits we have not seen for a while, suddenly appear in our markets.  One fruit that always catches my attention are pomegranates. Their sweet tart flavor is something that I treasure very much and consequently I use pomegranates in countless desserts.  The beautiful red arils can be striking on petit fours or fruit tarts containing other red fruits.

One of my favorite flavor combinations with pomegranate is violet (Violette). The essence of violet can be tricky to find in many places in the world, but luckily violet liqueur is much easier to come by. It adds a delicious floral taste to red fruits such as raspberries or strawberries without making these soapy. Since Bavarian cream is pretty much neutral in flavor it is an excellent candidate to be aromatized by violet and thus pair beautifully with pomegranate.

Assembly:
Prepare the Breton shortbread and set aside. Prepare the Bavarian cream and pour the cream half full into silicone domes. Sprinkle pomegranate arils in the center. Fill with additional Bavarian cream and top with a baked Breton shortbread. Freeze until firm. Unmold and allow to defrost. Serve with the raspberry violet coulis.

<title>Chocolate cremeux with Citrus gelee</title>
<description>

Some desserts are crowd pleasers and one of these is without a doubt chocolate cremeux. The creamy smooth texture is like no other and most people find it simply irresistible. One of the things I keep in mind when I prepare chocolate cremeux is that it is indeed rich and therefore I combine it with other elements that will cut this richness. We all know that every dessert should have balance to ensure that consuming it is true pleasure.
To create balance in this particular dessert, I selected an agrumes or citrus gelée since it is not only delectable by itself but it also pairs wonderful with chocolate. Ruby red grapefruit is one of the fruits I love to mix in a citrus gelée since I much adore its floral attributes. Even though grapefruit is delicious it can be a difficult one to harmonize into a dessert.

In a way cremeux and citrus gelée do not necessarily require much in term of other textures. A little tease is really all what’s needed. For the strip of marshmallow I used the orange marshmallow recipe from On Baking, but the lime marshmallow recipe I have on my site is an equal contender. Pop a little streusel or crumble in the glass and you are done!
Assembly!
Once you made the cremeux allow it to cool until lukewarm before pouring it in the glasses. Pouring it still warm will create a skin and covering the glass with plastic food wrap may create a steamy water drop filled glass. Allow 2 hours of chilling in a refrigerator before you tilt the glasses and fill it with the gelée agrumes. The gelée needs to be below room temperature before being filled in the glasses or it will melt the upper layer of the cremeux. A marble effect is not part of the look!
For optimum creaminess cremeux it is best served not straight from the refrigerator.  In a restaurant situation get the chill out by placing it in a low setting microwave for a few seconds. At home remove it from the refrigerator 30 minutes or so before serving.

Follow the method and temperatures closely to obtain a perfect smooth result.
Bring the cream, milk and about half of sugar to a boil in a small saucepan. Meanwhile in a bowl, whisk the egg yolk smooth and very rapidly whisk in the remaining sugar. Make sure no egg yolk and sugar lumps are still visible.
Pour a quarter of the boiling milk into the egg yolk mixture and whisk quickly. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the heated milk and on low heat stir the mixture to 183⁰F (81⁰C) while CONSTANTLY stirring using a rubber spatula. Remove from heat and pour into another bowl to stop the cooking process.
Add the chocolate and using an immersion blender or whisk make the mixture smooth. Allow to cool until lukewarm before pouring into glasses. Place in a refrigerator.

<title>Hibiscus sorbet</title>
<description>

A large number of fruit requires specific preparation to enhance them and become truly delicious. Take for example a pluot, when they are ripe they are certainly sweet, but they do have a texture which begs for further enhancement.
When pluots are not fully ripe, I prefer to poach them in sweet white wine enhanced by a few dried hibiscus flowers. Hibiscus is a favorite of mine to accent the flavor of pluots. Poaching softens the texture perfectly and when served with gelato or other creams it simply makes a very delicious dessert.
When I have perfectly ripe pluots on hand, I choose to sauté them in honey and lime juice which is truly wonderful. In this case I bring in Hibiscus via sorbet.


Hibiscus makes a very flavorful and gorgeous colored sorbet. What I like about hibiscus is that although it is a flower, it has a fresh edge, a crispness which many other floral lack. We all know perfectly well that many people object to certain dried flowers in food and find them soapy and simply unappealing. The hibiscus sorbet is low on sugar which makes it a perfect candidate to be served as soon it is made for optimum smoothness.  Adding raspberry puree to hibiscus sorbet creates amazing results as well.
Getting it all together!
Choose ripe pluots for this dessert. Find the streusel recipe on pg 395, in On Baking, second edition. Struesel can be made weeks in advance and frozen in a well sealed container. For the decorative caramel ring find recipe in On Baking, pg 729.

<title>Dessert in a Glass</title>
<description>

Cherries topped with chocolate Port sauce and hazelnut streusel
One of the things I like about serving a dessert in a glass or verrine is that no special equipment is needed. All you basically need is a modern style glass and you are set to go to make a contemporary dessert. The other and most important reason is that a glass allows options which may not be possible if the dessert is made other than in a glass. Take for example mousses and creams of all kinds, if made into molds these usually will need a higher amount of setting agent (gelatin, chocolate, cocoa butter, agar, eggs etc) compared to a cream destined to go directly in a glass.  Softer creams are always more wonderful on the palate, no one can argue with that.

For this dessert I covered the cherries with a delicious chocolate Port sauce. Cherries pair wonderfully with chocolate and the Port enhances and deepens the flavor of the cherries beautifully. Something else that works perfectly with cherries is hazelnuts and therefore the cherries are topped with hazelnut streusel. For the vanilla cream I selected a Panna cotta flavored with Kirsch liquor but a Bavarian cream or a vanilla gelato would be just great as well.
Getting It All Together!
Panna cotta can easily be made a day ahead and kept in the refrigerator. The chocolate port sauce will last for at least a week in a refrigerator and the streusel can be frozen unbaked. Simply bake what you need.
Chocolate Port Sauce
Yield: -4 -6 servings



1 Cup
(8   oz)
Ruby   Red Port
240   g


3 Tablespoons
(1.5   oz)

Bitter sweet chocolate
30 g


2 teaspoons
(1/3   oz)
Unsalted butter
10 g


1 pinch
(1   pinch)
Fleur de sel
pinch


















































































In a saucepan bring the Port to a boil and reduce to at least half. Remove from heat.
Whisk in the chocolate and let cool for a few minutes until the temperature is near 120°F (49°C).
Whisk in the butter and salt.



Hazelnut Streusel
Yield: 8 oz (240 g)



4 Tablespoon
(2   oz)

<title>Liquor Filled Chocolates</title>
<description>

Liquor filled chocolates intimidating, difficult or confusing to make? Not really.
Liquor filled chocolates can be made in a variety of ways and the method I describe here is certainly my favorite.  It is my preferred process for a variety of reasons but mainly it is a texture issue.  Most often Liquor filled chocolates are made with a crystallized sugar crust which I find, gives a poor and unpleasant mouth experience. In chocolates I like all types of crisp textures (Nougatine, nuts, toffee, caramel etc) however; it is crystallized sugar which I find to be completely incompatible with chocolate.




The one advantage that liquor filled chocolate with a starch made crystallized sugar crust have is that they have a long shelf life. Much longer compared to the ones I feature here. The reason for this is that a starch made crystallized sugar crust prevents the liquor syrup from getting in contact with the chocolate. Without this crust the liquor syrup weakens the chocolate shell and therefore these types of chocolates need to be consumed within a few days up to one week. However one of the gains with this method, is that the syrup does not have to contain the same (high) sugar concentration to ensure that proper crystallization will take place.  Consequently these liquor filled chocolates offer a wider array of liquors which can be used. Time wise this method allows for making liquor filled chocolates from start to finish within an hour.


Getting It All Together!
You can make the chocolate shells and liquor syrup days in advance. Keep both in a cool environment but not a refrigerator. Ensure you have confectionery fondant on hand to seal the chocolates.




Liquor filled chocolates
Yield: 90



8 oz
(8   oz)
Water
240   g


1 ½ Cup + 2 Tbsp
(13   oz)
Extra fine granulated sugar
390 g


1   Cup
(   8 oz)
Grand Marnier or other liquor
240 g


As needed
(A/S)
Candied Orange peel (Optional)
A/N


4 Tablespoons
(2   oz)
Unsalted butter, soft
60 g








4 Tablespoons
(2   oz)
Confectionery Fondant
60 g






































































Prepare chocolate shells in molds which will provide a stable vessel. (Do not use molds with a rounded top). Set aside.
Bring water and sugar to a boil and boil for a full minute. Let cool to room temperature.
Measure 8 oz (240 g) of the cooled syrup (set remaining amount aside). Add an equal amount of Grand Marnier to the measured syrup.
Place a piece of candied orange peel in each chocolate cup. If using a very small piece chances are that the peel will float to the surface. Use a small amount of crystallized chocolate to “Adhere” the candied peel in the cup and thus prevent floating.
Fill the cups with the liquor syrup ensuring no dripping on the edges.
Cream the butter with the fondant and warm the mixture to make it very runny.
Pipe a thin layer of the mixture onto the syrup which will automatically flout to the surface. Allow to firm at room temperature-this will only take minutes.
Seal the chocolates with a small amount of chocolate thinned with the addition of 15% of grapeseed oil.
The chocolates do not need to be refrigerated.

<title>Hazelnut shortbread</title>
<description>

For certain events a professional pastry chef is often faced with having to prepare bite size cookies which are attractive looking and at the same time delicious. Shortbread is usually a good candidate for such instance since they have an undeniable elegance about them.
The shortbread featured here is in many places in the world called a petit four sec.  Dipping the shortbread in crystallized chocolate is optional but it is something I prefer to do since it elevates something which is rather simple to something exceptional.
Getting it all together!
Unbaked shortbread freezes very well and thus can easily be made in advance. Once baked it is best the day it is made. However, when well packaged it does last several days.  You can certainly dip the entire shortbread in chocolate and thus extending the shelf life even further.


Hazelnut shortbread
Note: Protein or gluten content varies in flour, even within a specific type and thus has an effect on the final texture. Since shortbread is all about the texture it may be necessary to slightly adjust the amount of flour and or replace part of the flour with corn starch.
Yield: 40



8 oz
(8   oz)
Unsalted   butter, soft
240   g


7/8 cup
(3.5   oz)
Powdered sugar
105 g


½   teaspoon
(   ½ tsp)
Salt
2.5   g


1 teaspoon
(1tsp)
Vanilla extract
5 ml


¾ Cup
(3   oz)
Hazelnut flour, toasted
90 g








1 + ¾ Cup
(8   oz)
Pastry flour
240 g






































































Mix the butter and powdered sugar until well blended but not creamed.
Add salt, vanilla and vanilla extract. Mix in the toasted hazelnut flour.
Add flour and mix until just combined. Place in a refrigerator until cold enough to be rolled.
Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into desired shapes.
Bake at 350°F (180°C) until light golden brown, about 14 minutes.
When cool dip into crystallized or tempered chocolate.

<title>Cold Brewed Coffee Gelee</title>
<description>

During the summer months I always infuse or “brew” cold coffee at our home. The full and dynamic flavor with low acidity that cold brewed coffee provides is something that I love.  Infusing cold allows you to detect flavor nuances in the coffee which are nearly impossible to detect when brewed hot. Ordinarily I pour some of the cold infused coffee concentrate in some water with a touch of sugar and cream and serve it on the rocks.
At times I will add a touch of gelatin to cold brewed coffee and serve as dessert. Along with a small crème brûlée or a small amount of vanilla or chocolate gelato it is very delicious.
To make cold brewed coffee it is important to start off with excellent coffee which has no bitter or harsh undertones. My preference to use is espresso made by Kimbo ®; this Italian coffee has slight chocolate and buttery undertones which are perfect for this dessert.
Getting it all together!
The brewing or infusing process takes 12 hours so do this step ahead. The infusion will last for a week in the refrigerator.

<title>Strawberry Gelato</title>
<description>

The combination of strawberries and a balsamic vinegar reduction is a classic for good reason, made with ripe and flavorful strawberries it is simply amazing. For a while now I have been thinking on how to make the strawberry-balsamic reduction work in a frozen entremet or ice cream cake. After several experiments and fine tuning I must say that this particular frozen entremet is really, really good. At times strawberry ice cream can make you long for a deeper strawberry flavor, but not here, this hybrid of gelato and sorbet is rich and robust in flavor.

The sweetness of the meringue is dually tamed here, first by the addition of cocoa nibs and second by the balsamic vinegar, which is the perfect accompaniment to the strawberry flavor.
Getting It All Together!
Prepare the meringue up to a week in advance, store airtight to maintain crispness. Assemble the frozen entremet or frozen ice cream cake a full day before serving, this will allow proper firming in the ring.
Assembly: Upside down
Prepare a French meringue as described in On Baking, second edition on page 414and fold in 3 oz (90 g) cocoa nibs along with second amount of granulated sugar. Pipe into circles, slightly smaller of the rings diameter. Bake as described and trim slightly after baking to make the meringue slightly smaller than the ring.
Place a ring on a patterned silform and set aside.
Fill the bottom of the ring with just churned strawberry gelato. Place a meringue layer onto the gelato. Fill with a small amount of gelato and then the balsamic reduction. More gelato and finish off with the meringue disk. Freeze overnight.
Turn upside down and unmold with the use of a torch.

<title>Chocolate Caramels</title>
<description>

Salted chocolate caramels
A good chocolate cream caramel is not only delicious it is also very addicting. At times I prepare them with pre-toasted hazelnut which is just as with salt, an irresistible combination. Caramels can be a little finicky to prepare, undercooked and they will not cut properly, overcooked and they will be too firm. If cooked too slowly they may turn grainy, cooked too fast in a poorly made pot and the caramel may burn! It is clear to see why some people find them too much trouble.

For caramels you need a good pot to cook the mixture in. I prefer to cook caramel on an induction cook top over gas. (But then again I prefer induction for most things I do in the kitchen) If I had a rounded bottom copper pot perhaps then I would use gas. Induction cooks very fast and bothersome gas flames will not flare up along the sides of the pot.

Getting it all together!
Preferably prepare the caramel a day or at least 5 hours before dipping in crystallized couverture chocolate. Making it a day ahead will make the cutting a lot easier and the caramel will be less sticky.

Place candy rulers in a 10 inch (25 cm) square pattern on a Silpat which is placed on a marble.
Combine the first 5 listed ingredients in a heavy bottom –well made pan and while constantly stirring boil to 250F 121C.
Pour the caramel quickly between the rulers. Do not scrape the bowl! Scraping remnants out the bowl can very quickly make the caramel turn grainy.
Let the caramel set preferably overnight.
Cut into desired shapes and dip in crystallized (tempered) chocolate couverture and sprinkle with fleur de sel.

<title>Flour Free Chocolate Cake</title>
<description>

To make certain bakery items gluten free it may be necessary to replace wheat flour with tapioca, rice, bean and or other flours, but at times, great results can also be obtained without using any of these at all. Case in point this featured chocolate hazelnut layer cake, which is moist, all natural and has a perfect texture.

Oftentimes we forget that cocoa powder contains a good amount of starch and fiber, ingredients which absorb moisture and are part of the cake building structure. Therefore making a cake without flour in case of a chocolate cake is not very complicated. In fact by simply manipulating the ingredients a perfect chocolate cake without flour can easily be obtained.



Getting it all together!
If you want to obtain sharply cut sides on the cake it is best to bake, fill and assemble the cake and then freeze it. Frost it the next day with room temperature ganache than freeze it, give it a second coat with heated ganache or cocoa gelée and cut while frozen.
Chocolate Cake without Flour
Yield: 1 full sheet pan



12
(8   oz)
Egg   yolks
240   g


1 tsp
(1   tsp)
Vanilla extract
5 ml


12
(12   oz)
Egg whites
360   g


1 ½ Cups
(12   oz)
Extra fine granulated sugar
360   g


½ Cup
(4   oz)
Cocoa powder, sifted
120   g








1 Cup
(4   oz)
Toasted hazelnut or almond flour
120 g






































































Whip the egg yolks to a mousse consistency, add the vanilla and set aside.
Whip the egg whites and granulated sugar to stiff peaks
Right before folding the egg yolks into the egg whites give the egg whites a good whip to make them “creamy” and make it easier for the remaining ingredients to be homogenized into the batter. Gently fold the yolks into the egg whites. It is not necessary to fold the mixture until all the yolk streaks are gone.
Gently fold in the cocoa powder and nut flour.
Spread the batter on a parchment lined full sheet pan and bake in a 350F (180C) oven until the cake bounces back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.




Assembly:

Once cooled cut the cake crosswise in 4 equal strips. Spread low sugar raspberry jam (On Baking pg 620) on one layer and cover with another layer. Repeat until all used. Do not cover with jam on the top layer.
Spread a thin layer of room temperature ganache (On Baking page 494) on the surface.
If desired coat with a layer of heated Cocoa gelée (On Baking pg 560) for a brilliant finish.
Cut into desired size.

<title>Creme Chiboust</title>
<description>

Chocolate Crème chiboust
One of the things I love about a well made Crème Chiboust is that it allows the flavor it contains to really shine through. The primary reason why a crème chiboust has a well pronounced flavor is that it is much lower in fat compared to many other mousses. Fat tends to coat our taste buds making it harder to fully taste the flavor nuances.
Essentially, a crème chiboust is nothing more than a just prepared (and still hot) pastry cream lightened with a (still warm) Italian style meringue. Using an Italian Meringue over a regular cold made meringue is my preferred method since it provides better stability of the cream.

For this particular dessert I used star anise, a much underused spice witch pairs excellently with oranges or kumquats. The combination of the fruit and star anise is not only refined but also works gloriously with the chocolate crème chiboust.
Getting it all together!
If serving the dessert as shown in the picture make the chocolate crème chiboust and the star anise panna cotta a day ahead and freeze overnight. Cut it into desired shapes. If serving the dessert in a verrine you can make the chiboust the day of serving just allow a few hours for chilling.

(8 oz)
Egg whites
240 g








































In a saucepan bring the milk to a boil.
In a separate bowl whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Add sugar (a) and whisk rapidly until smooth, add cornstarch and whisk smooth. Whisk in half of the boiling milk.
Pour the egg yolk mixture into the remaining boiling milk and whisk rapidly to a boil. Boil for 1 minute and remove from heat. Stir in the chocolate and bloomed gelatin. (Blooming gelatin is achieved by placing gelatin sheets in ice cold water for 5-10 minutes to soften, and then squeeze out excess water.)
Cover the crème with plastic food film and do not place in an ice bath. Simply keep at room temperature.
Immediately prepare the Italian Meringue: In a saucepan bring the sugar (b), invert sugar and water to a boil, wash away any sugar crystals.
Place the egg whites in a machine bowl fitted with a whip attachment and whip on low speed.
 When the sugar syrup has reached 250°F (121°C) remove from heat and whip the egg whites in high speed. Pour the syrup along the inner edge of the bowl in a steady stream.
Whip until lukewarm and remove from machine.
Quickly whisk the chocolate cream to make perfectly smooth and in increments fold in the Italian meringue.
Mold as desired. (Here the crème Chiboust was spread on a silicone lined sheet ½ Inch (1.2 cm) thick)
Freeze and cut into desired shapes. Spray with chocolate spray.

<title>Swiss Style Carrot Cake</title>
<description>

There is something to be said for classic or traditional cakes. Who does not appreciate the comfort and enduring good flavor of a traditional carrot cake? It is fair to say that classic cakes become classic, simply because they stand the test of time due to their flavor and texture balance.
I have made all types of carrot cakes, some iced with traditional cream cheese icing, others topped with mascarpone cream and lots of poached pineapple, carrot cake as a pound cake, Swiss style carrot cake…. When properly made they are all delicious.
For a plated dessert version of carrot cake I like to get almond or hazelnut flour in the mix. Both of these nut flours bring an unsurpassed flavor and finesse to carrot cake. Using almond or hazelnut flour is not necessarily a new concept, in Swiss style carrot cakes (Aargauer Rublitorte) it is the norm. To give carrot cake a contemporary feel I may use silicone ware or simply make it in a sheet. Once baked, I cut the cake in a desired shape to lend a new feel to classic carrot cake.

Getting it all together!
Ice the carrot cake either with a cream cheese or mascarpone frosting or with a mascarpone cream. All versions are very good, it is just a matter of personal taste.
The carrot strips can be made a week in advance as they remain excellent when well packaged. These strips are very delicious and allow a fresh and contemporary look to a carrot cake. In “On Baking” we showcase the carrot strips on a traditional American style carrot cake.
Serve this cake with either a carrot-mango sorbet or mascarpone ice cream.

<title>Belgian Waffles</title>
<description>

Golden crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside with a near see thru appearance are the characteristics of a perfect waffle.
In Belgium, this type of waffle is known as the Brussels waffle where it is very popular. The Belgian or Brussels waffle was first introduced in 1856 at the fair in Brussels, although other types of waffles had been around for a much longer time.  In fact a waffle iron can be seen on a painting by Pieter Breughel, dating back to 1559.

Traditionally waffles in Belgium are consumed as a dessert and served with powdered sugar, whipped cream, butter, ice cream, chocolate sauce, fruits etc. In the United States most people consume waffles for breakfast. In our home we serve waffles both for weekend breakfast (piled with lots of fresh fruit) and for dessert.
Getting it all together!
Since yeast is involved with this type of waffle it takes time to for this batter to reach perfection, therefore, if you are planning to serve this type of waffle for breakfast it is best to make these during the day and simply freeze them. Defrosting is quick and once they come out of the toaster they are still very good. If you serve them for dessert or an afternoon snack make them fresh!

<title>Chocolate Decor</title>
<description>

Many pastry students have asked if I could spend a few topics on chocolate decoration techniques so here is the first one. The décor featured here is one of my favorites since it has a contemporary feel and at the same time it is very organic almost crude in appearance. On modern style entremet I love the juxtaposition of slick with organic.
This type of chocolate décor can be made with non crystallized or untempered chocolate but best results will be obtained if you do use crystallized chocolate. Using crystallized chocolate will allow you to make these décor in advance and store them at 63°F (17°C) without the risk of the décor taking on a dull appearance. At slightly higher temps the décor should last at least a week.
For certain chocolate decorations a room temperature marble slab is used along with crystallized chocolate. However, for the decoration highlighted here, a marble slab is used which is placed in a freezer for at least one hour. Once chocolate is spread on a super cold marble slab it crystallizes quickly, but in an incomplete state which allows us to shape the chocolate in various ways.
Getting It All Together!

1. Temper or crystallize chocolate. Remove marble slab from freezer and scrape away any condensation. Pipe chocolate on marble slab.

2. Using a pastry comb spread chocolate in thin strips.

3. Using a pastry wheel or paring knife cut into desired size.

4. Lift the chocolate off the marble and turn upside down.

5. Roll the chocolate decor while still soft.
