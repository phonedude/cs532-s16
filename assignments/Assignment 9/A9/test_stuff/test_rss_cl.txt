<title>Star Anise Nougatine in Chocolate</title>
<description>

Star anise nougatine enrobed in chocolate certainly belongs to a selection of finer style Belgian chocolates.  Too bad that chocolates made with nougatine can be rather difficult to find, unquestionably it is a product which requires attention to detail. Since the confection featured here does not contain a cream, ganache or other typical filling, it is not a true “Praline” or “Belgian style chocolate”. Essentially it is a chocolate bar which contains a sheet of nougatine.  Delicious nevertheless and it has the enormous benefit of having long shelf life.
The nougatine recipe below is made without corn syrup or glucose. Although more affected by humidity, it does provide an incomparable caramel flavor. In “On Baking” a recipe for nougatine (pg 734) can be found using only glucose and fondant. Such combination is excellent for use in showpieces or for pieces which require long conservation or when working in a humid environment.
When using star anise in nougatine it is important to use invert sugar, without it the nougatine can quickly crystallize when the star anise is added, turning it into a disappointing result.  Remember that nougatine requires cooking the sugar to a perfect caramel and adding flawlessly toasted almonds. Dairy or cocoa butter is added at the end. Dairy butter provides the best flavor but cocoa butter works best in high humidity kitchens.  For further tips and ideas on nougatine you may want to read another article on nougatine on my site.

 
Star Anise Nougatine




2 oz
Invert sugar
60 g



9 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
270 g



4 oz
Toasted almonds
120 g



1 tsp
Star anise, ground
2 g









¾
Unsalted butter
20 g



pinch
Fleur de sel
pinch



 

Set aside a silpat and a rolling pin. If using a wooden rolling pin, butter it lightly. Not necessary if using a silicone rolling pin. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C)
In a saucepan bring the invert sugar to a boil, add a few tablespoons of the listed sugar and stir to melt the sugar (Do not allow to caramelize at this point). Add a few more tablespoons of sugar and stir until melted again. Continue with slowly adding larger amounts of sugar. Do not vigorously stir at any point.
Cook to a golden caramel stirring gently. Remove from heat, immediately add the toasted almonds, star anise, butter and fleur de sel. Stir to combine with a heat resistant or wooden spatula.
 Scrape the nougatine onto the silpat. Let sit for a few moments and then start gently rolling the nougatine into a thin sheet about the thickness of 3 stacked credit cards.
If the nougatine hardens before it is sufficiently thin, keep it on the silpat and place it in the oven to slowly soften. Press with a finger to check if it is soft enough and then roll once more.
Cut into shapes which will fit your chocolate molds and allow to cool.
Pour tempered chocolate into molds, allow the chocolate to nearly set, place a piece of nougatine in the mold.
Cover with chocolate and remove excess. Remove when chocolate has retracted from mold.

<title>Homemade Baking Powder</title>
<description>

 
All of us have tasted baked products which had a chemical soapy flavor with hints of bitterness, sourness and sulfur. Usually this problem occurs when relative high amounts or a certain type of baking powder is used. In muffins that contain lots of spices or other additions, it is logically harder to detect these undesired flavors. However, with many years of working with students, I have discovered that some people are very sensitive to the residual flavor of chemical leaveners and will even identify them in complex flavored muffins and cakes.  I have found that using homemade baking powder can provide better tasting results, especially in products that contain rather simple and fewer ingredients.  For example in certain scones, American style breakfast biscuits, French Sablé Breton (Breton shortbread) etc…. using a little too much baking powder or the wrong type can result in unsatisfactory results.
Homemade baking powder can be made by combining baking soda* with cream of tartar **. Certainly you may know that bicarbonate of soda is used to treat heartburn or acid indigestion and cream of tartar is a byproduct of wine making. Partly what sets this formula apart is that it does not contain one or both of the following chemicals often found in commercial baking powder:  Sodium aluminum sulfate and monocalcium phosphate.
An important thing to remember is that the recipe below for homemade baking powder is “single acting”. Therefore products need to be baked as soon as they are made, especially in moist batters such as muffins and certain cakes. In my testing, a wait time of 60-90 minutes before products with low moisture (breakfast biscuits, Sablé Breton) were baked, showed no difference in activity and rise compared to  products which were immediately baked.  Purchased double acting baking powder has the advantage that products can be frozen and baked later.
*Also known as:  bicarbonate of soda (Alkali) or sodium bicarbonate.
** Also known as potassium bitartrate or potassium hydrogen tartrate

Note: This recipe for baking powder performs very well, in your recipes use the same amount as you would if using purchased baking powder or double acting baking powder. You may even consider using slightly less of this blend compared to purchased baking powder.

<title>Coconut Sablée | Shortbread</title>
<description>

Every Pastry Chef I know always gets this question” What’s your best or favorite dessert?” I find this very hard to answer. Each dessert has its own sensation and to pinpoint the absolute best or favorite of your repertoire is nearly impossible.  How do you compare a croissant aux chocolat to a brownie with toasted hazelnuts? Or tender Brioche to crepes filled with flambéed pineapple? They can all be perfect. One thing that we do have is our favorite base dough, batters, creams etc. Our great performers in taste, texture, how it bakes….For me, one of these favorites is coconut sablée. I adore its texture,flavor, its versatility and simply how people respond to it…



 
Coconut Sablée | Coconut Shortbread
 




1 lb 1 oz
Unsalted premium butter, soft
500 g



7 oz
Powdered sugar
210 g



2 tsp
Vanilla extract
10 ml



1 ½ tsp
Salt
6 g



3
Egg yolks
3









7 oz
Desiccated / macaroon coconut
210 g









1 lb 2 oz
Pastry flour
540 g

























































1.            Mix the soft butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt until well combined but not until light and creamy.
2.            Add the yolks one at a time waiting for previous added amount to be fully incorporated. Add the macaroon coconut and mix to combine.
3.            Add the flour in one step and mix until just combined. Chill for at least one hour. The best flavor will be obtained by allowing the dough to mature 1-2 days in the refrigerator before rolling and baking.
4.            Roll the dough 0.13 inches (3.5 mm) thick and cut in desired size squares. Bake at 350°F (180°C) until light golden.
5.            When cooled dip into tempered chocolate couverture (80% milk chocolate couverture + 20% dark couverture 56%) .
