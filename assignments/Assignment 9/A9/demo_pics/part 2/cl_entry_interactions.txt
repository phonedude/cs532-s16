Title:     Star Anise Nougatine in Chocolate

Star anise nougatine enrobed in chocolate certainly belongs to a selection of finer style Belgian chocolates.  Too bad that chocolates made with nougatine can be rather difficult to find, unquestionably it is a product which requires attention to detail. Since the confection featured here does not contain a cream, ganache or other typical filling, it is not a true “Praline” or “Belgian style chocolate”. Essentially it is a chocolate bar which contains a sheet of nougatine.  Delicious nevertheless and it has the enormous benefit of having long shelf life.
The nougatine recipe below is made without corn syrup or glucose. Although more affected by humidity, it does provide an incomparable caramel flavor. In “On Baking” a recipe for nougatine (pg 734) can be found using only glucose and fondant. Such combination is excellent for use in showpieces or for pieces which require long conservation or when working in a humid environment.
When using star anise in nougatine it is important to use invert sugar, without it the nougatine can quickly crystallize when the star anise is added, turning it into a disappointing result.  Remember that nougatine requires cooking the sugar to a perfect caramel and adding flawlessly toasted almonds. Dairy or cocoa butter is added at the end. Dairy butter provides the best flavor but cocoa butter works best in high humidity kitchens.  For further tips and ideas on nougatine you may want to read another article on nougatine on my site.
Star Anise Nougatine
2 oz
Invert sugar
60 g
9 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
270 g
4 oz
Toasted almonds
120 g
1 tsp
Star anise, ground
2 g
¾
Unsalted butter
20 g
pinch
Fleur de sel
pinch
Set aside a silpat and a rolling pin. If using a wooden rolling pin, butter it lightly. Not necessary if using a silicone rolling pin. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C)
In a saucepan bring the invert sugar to a boil, add a few tablespoons of the listed sugar and stir to melt the sugar (Do not allow to caramelize at this point). Add a few more tablespoons of sugar and stir until melted again. Continue with slowly adding larger amounts of sugar. Do not vigorously stir at any point.
Cook to a golden caramel stirring gently. Remove from heat, immediately add the toasted almonds, star anise, butter and fleur de sel. Stir to combine with a heat resistant or wooden spatula.
 Scrape the nougatine onto the silpat. Let sit for a few moments and then start gently rolling the nougatine into a thin sheet about the thickness of 3 stacked credit cards.
If the nougatine hardens before it is sufficiently thin, keep it on the silpat and place it in the oven to slowly soften. Press with a finger to check if it is soft enough and then roll once more.
Cut into shapes which will fit your chocolate molds and allow to cool.
Pour tempered chocolate into molds, allow the chocolate to nearly set, place a piece of nougatine in the mold.
Cover with chocolate and remove excess. Remove when chocolate has retracted from mold.

Title:     Homemade Baking Powder

All of us have tasted baked products which had a chemical soapy flavor with hints of bitterness, sourness and sulfur. Usually this problem occurs when relative high amounts or a certain type of baking powder is used. In muffins that contain lots of spices or other additions, it is logically harder to detect these undesired flavors. However, with many years of working with students, I have discovered that some people are very sensitive to the residual flavor of chemical leaveners and will even identify them in complex flavored muffins and cakes.  I have found that using homemade baking powder can provide better tasting results, especially in products that contain rather simple and fewer ingredients.  For example in certain scones, American style breakfast biscuits, French Sablé Breton (Breton shortbread) etc…. using a little too much baking powder or the wrong type can result in unsatisfactory results.
Homemade baking powder can be made by combining baking soda* with cream of tartar **. Certainly you may know that bicarbonate of soda is used to treat heartburn or acid indigestion and cream of tartar is a byproduct of wine making. Partly what sets this formula apart is that it does not contain one or both of the following chemicals often found in commercial baking powder:  Sodium aluminum sulfate and monocalcium phosphate.
An important thing to remember is that the recipe below for homemade baking powder is “single acting”. Therefore products need to be baked as soon as they are made, especially in moist batters such as muffins and certain cakes. In my testing, a wait time of 60-90 minutes before products with low moisture (breakfast biscuits, Sablé Breton) were baked, showed no difference in activity and rise compared to  products which were immediately baked.  Purchased double acting baking powder has the advantage that products can be frozen and baked later.
*Also known as:  bicarbonate of soda (Alkali) or sodium bicarbonate.
** Also known as potassium bitartrate or potassium hydrogen tartrate

Note: This recipe for baking powder performs very well, in your recipes use the same amount as you would if using purchased baking powder or double acting baking powder. You may even consider using slightly less of this blend compared to purchased baking powder.

Title:     Coconut Sablée | Shortbread

Every Pastry Chef I know always gets this question” What’s your best or favorite dessert?” I find this very hard to answer. Each dessert has its own sensation and to pinpoint the absolute best or favorite of your repertoire is nearly impossible.  How do you compare a croissant aux chocolat to a brownie with toasted hazelnuts? Or tender Brioche to crepes filled with flambéed pineapple? They can all be perfect. One thing that we do have is our favorite base dough, batters, creams etc. Our great performers in taste, texture, how it bakes….For me, one of these favorites is coconut sablée. I adore its texture,flavor, its versatility and simply how people respond to it…

Title:     White Chocolate Mousse

White chocolate mousse can be pleasing provided it is combined with bitter, tart, fruits, spices (including spicy) components.  In desserts I prefer to keep white chocolate mousse at 50-60% of the total dessert volume.  More than this amount and our guest may have a hard time finishing the dessert or simply be bored.
In this particular dessert the white chocolate mousse is harmonized with coffee. Above the layer of the white chocolate mousse is a layer of cold brewed coffee gelée and topped with a caramel dipped profiterole filled with espresso flavored pastry cream.  Chocolate sauce and cocoa nibs to finish.
If you would use this mousse in a verrine, gelatin will not be a necessary ingredient, used for an entremet, add gelatin or cocoa butter to make it possible to cut into desired shapes.

Title:     A Sincere Thank You

This past Saturday night we were treated by seeing both John Legend and Sade live in concert. When I see amazing artists at work, whether they are musicians, fine furniture makers, chefs….something about their work always touches the very core of me. It’s what they do and how they do it, what moves me very deep inside. While watching, I catch myself with my head slightly tilted and with a smile on my face, the way we look at a newborn baby.  Many true artist and us chefs, do what we do because we simply love our profession.  We love to create and ensure that someone’s wedding, birthday, anniversary or their chocolate croissant is simply perfect. For us, money was never a motive, it always is about our creations and ensuring that someone receives joy from them.  Till this day, I still vividly remember where and when we had delicious meals and desserts, I am thankful not only for the meal itself but also, for the enduring memory. I remembered it because it was special, just like I remembered watching Seal, who made that particular night in August extraordinary.
Every day, thousands of you from around the world visit my site and I would like to sincerely thank you, for sharing my passion and for your work, which brings joy and lasting memories to the people who live near you. Maybe one day, when I am working or on vacation in your country, I will have the pleasure of tilting my head, smile and be touched, because I am eating a meal or dessert, made by you.
Could I thank you in advance for that memory?

Title:     Chocolate Gelato

In most parts of the world vanilla is the most sold ice cream flavor and chocolate second.  Indeed a very good reason to have chocolate gelato in your dessert repertoire. If you open our freezer at home, you will usually find chocolate and pistachio gelato.
For chocolate gelato I prefer not to use egg yolks as these can hinder the pure and true chocolate flavor.  However, when you do not use egg yolks, an ice cream stabilizer is needed to ensure a smooth emulsion. In chocolate gelato and many of my other chocolate preparations, I use a small amount of coffee extract to enhance the chocolate flavor.  It is no secret that all chocolate manufactures use either real or artificial vanilla extract in their chocolate because it makes it more delicious. To make chocolate gelato I like to add vanilla (even though it is already present in the chocolate) to complete the flavor.

Title:     Fig Tart

Figs are at their best when enhanced with recognizable but non overpowering flavors. For many fig varieties, I like to use mascarpone or a white chocolate cream, which improves the delicate sweetness of the fig and consequently increase its flavor.  Figs love to be in company of honey, white chocolate, Rum, Amaretto, mascarpone, oranges, toasted almonds, Port….
The miniature figs I used here were grown in Texas and given to me by Marcel, a great student of mine.

Title:     Marshmallow | Raspberry

The entire meringue family is very intriguing to me. Whether it is baked French style meringue layered into an entremet or an Italian Style meringue, frosted onto an ice cream cake, I am captivated by its versatility. Meringue is very adaptable indeed. Take for example Italian Meringue, used in mousses for creating an unequaled richness without adding fat, or used for piping onto countless desserts. When we simply add gelatin to Italian Meringue we have a confection popular the world over named marshmallow. Many people appreciate well made marshmallow, it’s delicate and light and at the same it time feels very rich and decadent on the human tongue.
Making confections with marshmallow and incorporating it into certain desserts is something I am very fond of. However, it is important to cut the sweetness of the marshmallow somehow.  This can easily be achieved by dipping it into chocolate which happens to be a sublime complement.
The raspberry marshmallows featured here are placed on a prebaked chocolate sablée square which adds a delicious texture. To ensure that the raspberry flavor is not overshadowed by the chocolate, it is dipped in chocolate couverture containing 58% cocoa mass.

Title:     Fruit tarts

A good tart shell, good cream and good fruit make one delicious dessert.  Although good hazelnut dough can be very delicious for a fruit tart, my favorite dough remains coconut shortbread tart dough.  It is one I use for lime and lemon tarts and certain petit four.
It has been my experience that many people in the United States are only mildly impressed with pastry cream, therefore for most tarts, I select either a cremeux or a cream flavored with fruit purees. For this particular mixed fruit tarts I used the refreshing and always delicious passion fruit cream.

Title:     Black Forest

Whether cream, chocolate, Kirsch and cherries are composed into a frozen dessert or plated (as shown here) they always please. Throughout my work, I have always been interested in discovering new flavor combinations, but at the same time I have always carefully studied the classics to discover what made them enduring.

 
Some fruits can even be more delicious when heated or sautéed and cherries belong exactly to this family. Flambéed cherries on gelato or served with panna cotta is simply perfection.
When I select a type of chocolate cake for black forest I make sure that it can be properly moistened with Kirsch liquor syrup.  Certainly a chocolate genoise or a sponge cake can be used but using a chocolate cake rich in almonds add more finesse.
Assembly

Cut a piece of chocolate      cake into a desired shape. Moisten well with the Kirsch syrup.

Title:     Quick Lime Curd

For plated desserts I very much make sure that the various elements are not too scattered, preventing the consumer of having to “work” at the dessert (Ensuring that every bite has a good balance). Most of us like desserts which are multi layered with zero effort during the consumption. For example take an éclair. The perfect layering and understated elegance is the reason why I believe it is a classic worldwide. Desserts in a glass (or verrine) can be perfectly balanced as well and are also very easy to consume. The components consisting of a little crunch, something soft, something smooth, textures of fruit, a touch of sorbet, all coming together in one and all the consumer has to do is dig in with a spoon. Another major benefit to a dessert in a glass is that the creams, curds etc it contains, can be made with none or little gelatin or other thickeners. It’s fair to say that everyone prefers soft, creamy fillings over firmer gelatinized ones.
This lime curd is one of my personal favorites. It does not require a long cooking time over a double boiler and has a silky smooth texture.

Assembly

Place a round disk of genoise or sponge cake on the bottom of the glass.
Moisten the cake generously with raspberry liquor flavored simple syrup.
Cover with a small amount of lime curd and sprinkle with fresh berries and sesame seed nou gatine.
Cover with remaining curd and allow to set for a few hours. Decorate with berries, sesame seed nougatine and raspberry sorbet.

Title:     Lemon Sorbet | Lemon Rose Geranium Sorbet

Few desserts refresh and excite our taste buds as lemon sorbet.  Lemon is wonderful when paired within the citrus family but can be equally as delicious when harmonized with black or red currant, edible geranium, ginger, apricot, milk chocolate and others.  Ginger, edible geranium and other flowers or herbs are simply extracted into the sorbet base syrup.  All citrus including lemon and lime are always best when freshly squeezed.
Sometimes the difference between sorbet and sherbet are not clearly understood. It basically lies in dairy products, sorbet does not contain milk or cream while sherbet does.
When I make sorbet as a plated dessert I often keep the other components low or completely free of fat as well. I do this mainly because I believe that when people choose sorbet as their dessert choice, they oftentimes seek something easy and light to digest. On this plate in addition to the lemon sorbet I added apricot pate de fruit and a strip of Italian Meringue.

Strain the syrup and add the lemon juice, churn according to your machine.
Spread the sorbet on a pre-chilled and plastic lined hotel pan to desired depth.
Freeze until hard and cut into desired shapes.
Place on a plate and serve with apricot pate de fruit and a strip of Italian Meringue. Torch the meringue and serve.

Title:     Opaline | Transparent Tuile

For many desserts, Opaline also known as a transparent tuile can be an eye catching decoration. It is easy to make and it can be colored as well. Since the ingredients are basically like a lollipop, opaline can be flavored with herbs, spices, extracts etc.  Like most sugar products it is quickly affected by humidity and therefore it needs to be stored airtight with a desiccant.  To combat the humidity, I also make opaline with the addition of isomalt.

Title:     White Chocolate Cremeux

If there is one ingredient which Pastry Chefs feel a bit uneasy about using in the pastry kitchen, it must be white chocolate. We know very well that many people consider white chocolate not real chocolate and most of us are not smitten with white chocolate the same way as we are with milk and or dark chocolate.  However, at times just a piece of good quality chocolate can be satisfying. To make a dessert containing white chocolate successful I like to incorporate several textures such as Gerbet macaron, Pate de fruit, streusel….Some fruits I like to harmonize with white chocolate include Red and black currants, raspberries, tart cherries and others.
Preparations containing white chocolate need to be made with a minimum of sugar or the result will be simply too sweet. Therefore white chocolate cannot be used the same way dark chocolate can. For example a dark chocolate mousse may contain a meringue while using a meringue in a white chocolate mousse would make it way too sweet.

In this white chocolate cremeux only a minimum amount of sugar is used to have a balanced level of sweetness.

Pour the tempered egg mixture into the heated cream and on low heat stir the mixture to 183⁰F (81⁰C) while CONSTANTLY stirring using a rubber spatula. Remove from heat and pour into another bowl to stop the cooking process. Add the bloomed gelatin leaf if using. (Using the gelatin will naturally provide a slight firmer setting)
Add the chocolate and using an immersion blender or whisk blend the mixture smooth. Add the liquor and pour into glasses and place covered in a refrigerator.
The cremeux will set in a few hours. Serve with sour cherry coulis, Gerbet macaroons, streusel and fresh cherries.

Title:     Arlettes

One of the things I like to prepare with leftover puff pastry trimmings are arlettes. Their lightness pairs perfectly with gelato, sorbet or a good fruit soup/plate. While I am writing this, I have arlettes by my side but no gelato or sorbet, only good espresso, and I must say it is quite delicious as well.
Oftentimes I prepare arlettes without any additional flavors, where only the butter and caramel flavor takes the forefront. But I do like these when made with cardamom and lemon, flavors I find most irresistible when paired with butter and caramel notes.

Although you can use newly prepared puff pastry, chilled leftover trimmings will do fine.

Title:     Petit Four | Lemon

Serving Petit fours are often more complicated than one would believe. How they will be served is just one of the issues. At a cocktail party where the guest usually have a beverage in one hand, it is important to keep in mind that they have little opportunity to fuss with forks, spoons, napkins etc. Having a guest reach into petit four which makes their fingers a sticky mess is not professional. Such items are best served on a spoon or specialty vessel. Flavor is also very important, during parties people often take a petit four from a platter without asking the server what flavor profile it is. Therefore selecting flavors which satisfy a broad audience is usually not a bad idea. Petit fours made with flavors which are unique or not appreciated by most can always be presented with a name card.
Preparing miniatures from classics is always a safe bet since people are familiar with them and know what to expect. One such is featured here as a lemon tart petit four made with a touch of candied orange peel.  A true classic which is still as delicious as it became popular in the 19th century.

Getting It All Together!
Recipe for the coconut tart dough: On Baking pg 389. Recipe for lemon curd: On Baking pg 503. For the miniature tart shells it is very important to roll the dough rather thin, 2 mm is a maximum. The coconut dough has a nice rise in the oven and making it any thicker makes for an unbalanced ratio of crust to filling. Tart shells can always be made and baked in advance and be frozen. When ready to fill place in a preheated oven for a few minutes to crisp up the shells.

Roll out the coconut tart dough and cut circles slightly larger than the tart shells. Press the dough into the shell and prick with a fork.
Bake in a 375°F (190°C) oven until light golden.
When cooled sprinkle a few pieces of candied orange peel on the bottom of each tart shell. Fill with the lemon curd. Let cool.
Pipe Italian Meringue on the surface and brown with a torch. Decorate with candied orange peel or as desired.

Title:     Mango Cremeux

Key to any good dessert is balance of ingredients. Using too much of any component can make any dessert unpleasant to eat. Unless of course if you particularly love a certain component. Take for example this individual Mango tart. The ratio of this light and delicate Breton Shortbread is rather high to the ratio of the Mango cremeux. Some will feel that the balance is lovely while others may prefer more cremeux. Neither is particularly wrong, it is a matter of personal preference. What we certainly all can agree on is that an overly thick and hard tart crust is always unpleasant.
What is nice about this dessert is that it is rather quick to make. The Breton shortbread is pressed or piped into silforms and baked. Once baked and cooled they can be filled with a variety of fillings.


Getting It All Together!
The Breton Shortbread is best baked the day of serving. Certainly the filled silforms can be frozen and defrosted later for bake off. The mango cremeux can be made a day in advance and right before using being mixed using an immersion blender or high speed blender for optimum smoothness.

Title:     Inverse Puff Pastry

Pastry Chefs have several options when it comes down to making Puff pastry and oftentimes will prepare the type which they are most familiar with or which they most prefer. Personally I have found that all types can produce excellent results when the procedure is properly followed. However based upon my research I do believe that puff pastry can differ in mouth feel. Some feel drier and some feel more buttery. Improperly made puff pastry can feel hard even though it is flaky. One thing for sure is that inverse puff pastry (Inversed or inverted puff pastry) bakes rather light and produces very flaky results. For filled applications such as apple turnovers or Pithivier I do prefer to use inverse puff pastry, reason being that it stands up real well to the steam/humidity produced from the fillings and consequently leaves virtually no traces of unbaked dough.
 
When preparing inverse puff pastry it is necessary to work in a cool kitchen. Instead of the butter block being wrapped by the dough it is enveloping it, thus a warm kitchen makes it nearly impossible to obtain good results. For the readers in the United States it is important to make this dough with butter labeled “European style” This type of butter contains less water and will produce better results. In other countries select butter with high fat content, this type of butter should also feel very firm in the refrigerator. Ghee or clarified butter is not recommended as some water is necessary to produce the flaky layers. Flour strengths differ around the world and thus additional flour may be needed to make the dough firm. Firm dough will create very flaky results.

Title:     Strawberry Tarts with Cassis Cremeux

Lately I have been preparing quite a few tarts made with puff pastry. Sure, in a way somewhat old fashioned and certainly far more difficult to handle if compared to shortbread style tart dough. However, I think that we can all agree that most people find pure butter puff pastry simply irresistible. It is one of my personal favorites as well, the flakes, the way it crumbles and then melts away, the amazing buttery flavor….. just extraordinary.

Certainly puff pastry does have disadvantages. Preparing the dough itself is a lengthy process and it is only wonderful the day it was baked. In case of puff pastry tart shells, they take a lot longer to prepare if compared to shortbread type tart shells. Simply the baking process takes a long time ….baking it blind, removing the paper and weights, pricking the dough, returning to the oven and ensuring that the dough is well pricked…..Another key element is that puff pastry is can be difficult in terms of giving the final product a contemporary edge.  It is unfortunate because puff pastry is really like no other.  Oftentimes I use puff pastry in plated dessert elements, where it is a little easier for me to give it a fresh, contemporary feel.

For the filling of a strawberry tart I love black currant (Cassis) cremeux. It comes from my parents who truly do grow the most delectable strawberries. Never have I had tasted such strawberries. One would believe the strawberries have been perfectly crossed with black currants. It is that exact flavor I am trying to copy which nature did so perfectly.

Getting It All Together!
At this time I have not featured an article on my site on making puff pastry so I must refer you to On Baking or your favorite recipe. Certainly prepare the puff pastry and perform the laminating the day before rolling the dough for the tart shells. Prepare the black currant cremeux once the tart shells are baked. As soon as the cremeux is made pour it in the baked crust and refrigerate. This will ensure a tart with a perfect “set” cremeux.

Title:     Kouing Aman

It is fair to say that most people find a perfect pure butter croissant or a delectable apple turnover simply irresistible. It is partly about the texture, the buttery flakes, the aroma and the desire for more.  Like nearly everyone, I am also a huge aficionado of Palmiers. To me, Palmiers caramelized crust and its buttery crisp layers are nothing less than a feast for the mouth.
Kouing Aman is a little of all of the above. It can be described as a crisp caramelized shell with flakey tender buttery layers with a most satisfying flavor.

For laminating dough in school we use a machine, but for a “how to roll by hand session” I have found that Kouing Aman is a perfect candidate. This because it does not have to be (although it can) as perfectly rolled as let’s say puff pastry.

From start to finish it is best to allow about 6 hours to prepare  Kouing Aman.

Title:     Valentine Dessert

Valentine menus tend to be filling and oftentimes rich. For such occasions I like to select a dessert which is either light or is very strong in flavor. This lemon and passion fruit cream does the trick. If desired serve with raspberry, champagne and rose or blackberry sorbet.
For the heart I made a lemon cream with a hint of passion fruit and poured it in a heart shaped silform and placed it in the freezer. Unmold and place it on a bed of baked meringue sticks. For the sauce I used a caramel passion fruit sauce without the use of pectin (On Baking pg 548). To the sauce I added 2 oz (60 g) of mango puree to give it additional body.

Lemon and Passion Fruit Cream
This cream is soft and creamy, for large functions where the dessert has to be out of the refrigerator for a while, add one bloomed sheet of gelatin before adding the butter.

In a non reactive saucepan bring to a boil the sugar (A), lemon and passion fruit juice.
In a separate bowl whisk the eggs for 30 seconds. Add sugar (B) and whisk vigorously for 1 minute. Pour one fourth of the boiled mixture to the eggs while whisking rapidly. Pour the tempered eggs into the remaining boiled mixture and whisk until the mixture comes to a rapid boil and bubbles thick like lava. Ensure that the mixture boils as this ensures a proper “set” from the eggs.
Let cool to 125°F (53C°). Stir in the SOFT butter. If any butter lumps remain, heat lightly in a microwave oven.
Pour the cream immediately into the heart shaped silicone molds and place in the freezer.
When frozen unmold.


1. Pipe tempered chocolate into a straw which has been closed at one end with plastic food wrap. After setting push out the chocolate using a wooden skewer.

1. Roll out coconut shortbread (or use hazelnut shortbread) (recipe for coconut shortbread is in On Baking pg 389) and cut into hearts. Bake at 375°F (180°C) until a hint of color appears.
2. Pipe a border of Almond macaronade (recipe On Baking pg 343) on the edge.
3. Fill with raspberry jam and bake until golden.
4. Once cooled, temper couverture chocolate. If desired thin the chocolate with 5 % grapeseed oil for easier flowing.
5. Pipe the chocolate into the center of the heart and sprinkle with cocoa nibs.

Title:     Cheesecake made with SteviaCane

At times a pastry chef has to make desserts which address certain dietary needs. Sometimes the product needs to be without gluten, lactose, salt or it may require having high fiber content. Some people chose or by doctor’s order need to reduce their sugar intake.
Making ingredient changes in desserts can be easy or challenging. Something easy for example is preparing lactose free pastry cream. All we have to do is switch the dairy milk to soy or almond milk and we obtain good results.  Recently I have done some research with an all natural product named SteviaCane, a combination of sugar and Stevia. It allows us to make desserts with half the amount of sugar, but with the same sweetening level outcome. If a recipe calls for let’s say 1 lb (450 g) of sugar you would only use 0.5 lb (225g) of SteviaCane.  For people who want to reduce their sugar and consequently their calorie intake, SteviaCane is a great solution.
When working with SteviaCane I usually make a few adjustments to the recipe in order to obtain professional and good final results. Remember, by using SteviaCane instead of sugar, we are essentially reducing the sugar by 50% and thus also reducing the moistness level naturally provided by sugar. Therefore in order to produce good cakes, cookies, pie fillings etc it is important to bring in moisture in some other ways.  Some moisturizing agents which have proven to be very effective include buttermilk, apple sauce and prune or raisin puree. If a recipe calls for 1 lb (450 g) of sugar, I would use 8 oz (225 g) SteviaCane and about 4-6 oz (120-180g) of any of the above mentioned moisturizers.  If making a pound cake, I would use buttermilk, for brownies I prefer raisin puree, for apple pie, I use apple sauce. Like everything else, best results are obtained by testing and fine tuning.
For this cheesecake I found that simply adding milk was the best option to obtain a silky smooth texture.

Title:     Gâteau Ferrini

Some of the finest cakes in the pastry shop oftentimes contain almonds. Just to name a few: Financier, Dacquoise, Pain de Genes, and Joconde…. Indeed they are some of a pastry chef most beloved cake layers to work with.  For this particular gâteau I used biscuit joconde as it allows me to moisten it with liquor syrup. Some cake layers such as Financier does not need moistening and dacquoise would be ruined if it was.

In this specific gateau, the multiple layers of Joconde moistened with Grand Marnier and layered with Ganache and grapefruit marmalade create a very fresh, slightly bitter and yet at the same time, a tender sweetness. At times, I like to serve this composition as a plated dessert accompanied by pink peppercorn chocolate sorbet and as a smaller version as Petit Four.



Getting It All Together!
The biscuit Joconde can be made days ahead and be frozen. At this time I am working on a recipe different than the one featured in On Baking, as soon as I have created a satisfactory result, I will publish it here. Not that I am not happy with the recipe featured in the book, it’s just that I cannot feature it on my site. Since American sheet pans are slightly larger than European ones I increased the ingredients for the Joconde recipe of On Baking by 20%.


Gâteau Ferrini
Yield: 3 gâteaux, each serving 6-8

Cut a full sheet joconde      crosswise into 4 equal strips. Moisten one strip with Grand Marnier syrup.
Spread a very thin layer      of grapefruit marmalade on the moistened layer. Cover with another strip      of joconde and moisten. Spread a thin layer of ganache on the surface.      Repeat the entire steps with joconde, grapefruit marmalade and ganache. Place in a      freezer.
Warm up a small amount of      Ganache to make it perfectly fluid, about 120°F (50°C ) pour onto the      surface to make it perfectly even. Cut into desired size.  Cover with sugared almonds and spray the      almonds with chocolate. Decorate as desired.

Bring to a boil the cream, sugar and invert sugar.
In a small bowl place the chocolate pistols or chocolate chopped in small pieces.
Pour the boiled mixture into the chocolate and using an immersion mixer (stick mixer) blend to a smooth mixture. Ensure to keep the mixer head completely submerged to prevent air being incorporated into the ganache.
Add the butter and blend smooth.

Note: Certainly the ganache can also be made by adding the cream in about 5 increments while stirring with a rubber spatula in a circular fashion.

Title:     Red Grapefruit Marmalade

It‘s no wonder that the botanical name for grapefruit is Citrus Paradisi. The scent, the flavor, the cholesterol lowering properties and the endless list of healthy attributes make it a fruit straight from paradise indeed.
Grapefruit is one of the fruits I love to use in desserts since it brings an unmatched flavor to countless desserts. The juxtaposition of sweet and tart in desserts is high on my list of importance and grapefruit is one that delivers. Rose, ginger, mango , Grand Marnier and certainly chocolate can be wonderful pairings with grapefruit.
Whenever I use citrus peel such as for grapefruit marmalade, I only use organic non treated grapefruits. I still do not know if conventional treated citrus fruit is ok to use, but I do know that they are treated with chemicals and often times lac resins. It is just not the type of thing I like to feed my wonderful engine. If anyone has scientific non partisan data on whether using non organic citrus peel is safe to use, I would really love to hear.



For many, marmalades or jams can be a little scary since they may not set if not properly prepared. For success it is important to stay with the listed recipe as the ingredients and their ratio play a vital role. If for example the sugar is reduced then the cooking time will increase resulting in cooked flavor. (Although I must say, for certain jams or marmalades I do reduce the sugar and I obtain proper setting by using additional pectin.) Certain fruits, such as the citrus family contain a good amount of the setting agent pectin, which naturally plays a very important role. Some fruit such as strawberries contain little pectin. For such fruit, specific cooking methods and or pectin additions are necessary for brilliant results. For many of my marmalades I like to make my easy to make “pectin cocktail” by simply simmering some non peeled Granny Smith apples in water. Once the apples are super tender I mash them and pour in a fine mesh sieve. The obtained juice is what I use to assist the gelling of my marmalades.
Getting It All Together!
Combining the peel, segments, sugar, apple juice and lemon juice has to be done a day before cooking the marmalade. This will ensure a pleasant (not too hard) peel and a perfect setting marmalade.

Title:     Lambic Raspberry Sorbet

This past summer Lieve Blancquaert and her amazing crew came to Houston and filmed me nonstop for 4 days for an episode of her beautiful documentary, titled “Made in Belgium”. It’s a series of 8 shows, each featuring a chef who works somewhere in the world. Her program took her to South America, Africa, North America and Europe. The show truly is a work of art, not only is it brilliantly presented and filmed, it also shows an in depth view of the work and life of the particular chef featured. It is the type of quality television we all wished we had more off.
During the week of filming it seems like we had a thousand activities planned which kept me very busy and left me pretty much exhausted by the end of the week. Lieve is the type of person you just want to give your all, her skillful way of interviewing combined with her down to earth manner makes it just so. One of the perks I enjoyed was to see her at work when she was photographing people in extraordinary settings. Besides doing television work, Lieve is a magnificent award winning photographer whose work is sought after the world over.
For the “Made in Belgium” show they filmed a segment where we had friends over for dinner at our home and what better to serve than famous Belgian beef stew cooked in Belgian beer? For dessert I made a sorbet made from one of my top favorite beers “Lambic Framboise” A marvelous quality raspberry beer with a gorgeous bouquet made since….1559! I simply love the fact that this beer is available here in the America. Some people may not be aware of the fact that fruits and vegetables were used to make beers long before hops came into play.
Since I receive countless requests on how to make chocolate decorations here is one example. If you are a novice in chocolate work, I suggest you use dark couverture chocolate. It is a little easier to work with and is stronger. Make sure you read some of my articles on how to temper or crystallize chocolate here or consult “On Baking”. Use a pastry comb or adhesive spreader from the hardware store to “comb” the tempered chocolate onto acetate plastic.
Cheers!

Using a pastry comb, comb the tempered chocolate onto firm acetate plastic  into lines.


Bend the acetate and connect the ends with adhesive tape. Let sit for 5 minutes at room temperature and than place in a cool room or refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Carefully remove the adhesive tape and release the obtained chocolate rings. Place in a pattern of choice.

Pipe tempered chocolate in the center of the decoration (Not shown) to connect all the loops. Place a round chocolate cutout in the center to beautify.

Title:     Macaron

A fruit which never seems to escape my interest are cranberries. I adore them in savory applications as well as in desserts.  Their acidic bitterness is particularly welcome in desserts which are by nature sweet and are in dire need of a touch of balance. Think for example of wonderful baked meringue layered with cranberry marmalade and crème Chantilly. It’s a composition I often make for our guest since it is a house favorite.

This Holiday season I decided to fill some of my macarons with a cranberry ganache.  At times I make this specific ganache without any cream, however it is slightly smoother with the cream, so this is the one I share with you today. If you decide to use this ganache as a soft filling for something that will be refrigerated, I suggest reducing the chocolate by 30%. Cranberries are loaded with natural pectin and the ganache will set with very little chocolate. The amount of sugar seems rather high, but it is correct, cranberries are indeed very bitter and require a good amount of sugar.
Getting it all together!
Gerbet Macaron can easily be filled a day ahead of serving. In fact it allows the filling to make the center of the macaron extra tender.  Prepare the ganache a day ahead of using to ensure proper crystallization.

Brioche with candied Buddha hand toasted hazelnuts
Good quality butter, a few ordinary ingredients and close attention to detail can make a most extraordinary brioche. The brioche I feature here is made with a sponge and therefore may not be as convenient to prepare, compared to a brioche where the dough is matured overnight in a refrigerator.
The mild lemony flavor of Candied Buddha hand in brioche is quite wonderful as it pairs with the butter flavor real well. Certainly Buddha hand can be expensive or hard to find in some countries and therefore may have to be replaced with other fruits.

Getting it all together!
Allow nearly seven hours from start to finish for this particular brioche. The fermentation can be rather slow in the beginning but do not increase the amount of yeast. Make sure you do allow the time required for the sponge to develop. A sponge is essential and ensures proper yeast activity in a very rich (Butter and eggs) environment.
Brioche with candied Buddha hand
Yield: 6 loaves
For the sponge:




10 oz
Water
300 g



0.5 oz
Instant yeast
15 g



9 oz
Eggs
270 g



1oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
30 g



12 oz
Bread flour
360 g


















































































Bring the water to 100°F (37°C). Whisk in the yeast and the eggs. Add the sugar and flour and combine until no lumps remain.
Cover and set aside in a warm place until doubled, about 90-120 minutes.

Main dough ingredients:




0.5 oz
Instant yeast
15 g



10 oz
Eggs
300 g



2 lb 8 oz
Bread flour
1200 g



5 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
150 g



3 oz
Invert sugar
90 g









1 oz
Salt
30 g









1 lb 6 oz
Unsalted butter, soft
660 g



12 oz
Candied Buddha hand, drained
360 g



12 oz
Hazelnuts, toasted
360 g



2 oz
Extra fine granulated sugar
60 g








































To the fermented sponge add the instant yeast and eggs and combine well. Add the bread flour, sugar, invert sugar and salt and mix using a dough hook until the dough is elastic and forms a window.
Add the soft butter in 4-5 increments on low speed, waiting for the previous added amount to be fully incorporated. Ensure that the dough does NOT exceed 78°F (26°C).
Add the candied Buddha hand and nuts and mix until just distributed.
Cover with plastic and allow the dough to ferment until doubled, about 60-80 minutes. Punch the dough and rest for 10 minutes.
For large Brioche molds weigh into 1 lb 4 oz (600 g) pieces for the loaves and 1.5 oz (45 g) for the center part. Make round.
Place in well buttered brioche pans and make a deep hole in the center. Place the small round in the hole. Place in a proof box until the loaves have 70% increased in size, about 60-80 minutes.
Brush with egg wash and bake in a 375°F (190°C) oven until thoroughly baked, about 42 minutes. Brioche will always obtain a dark crust, if a lighter crust is desired cover with aluminum foil near the end of baking.

Title:     Candied Buddha’s Hand

One of the most interesting looking fruits in our world is without a doubt Buddha’s hand or fingered citron. By now you probably know that I have not met a citrus that I do not like and Buddha’s hand is no exception.  Every year when these fruits become available I have an irresistible urge to incorporate them in desserts. The exquisite aromatic citrus along with a hint of Jasmine is a combination which is hard to resist. At times I will place one on our dinner table and skip the flowers.  In China, Buddha’s hand symbolizes long life and happiness. In Japan people will often bring a Buddha’s hand to people’s homes on New Years, as it is believed to present good fortune.  In our home it is a fruit I love to have as it very elegantly perfumes the air.

The interior flesh is spongy and very similar like the white pitch from other citrus but this one has absolutely no traces of bitterness. The fruit itself does not contain juice, so it does limit us in ways to use this fruit.   One of the things I prepare often with Buddha hand is a marmalade which I slightly dilute with Cointreau and serve with croissants or scones. It is very delicious.  Candying Buddha’s hand is also a great way to use this fruit, since it allows us to incorporate it in many ways.

Getting It All Together!
To candy Buddha’s hand, I prefer to remove a good amount of the white spongy part, not that it is bitter, I just prefer the peel more. Candied it will last for many weeks kept in the candying syrup in a refrigerator.

Title:     Green Tea Rice Cream

Green Tea Rice Cream With Semi Candied Strawberries
Most countries in the world have some type of a desserts made with rice, often it is a type of pudding or cream.  When I was a lad, my Mom would make countless versions of rice pudding but the ones I remember most vividly, contained cinnamon, vanilla and raisins. To this day, I still like rice creams or puddings. They seem to have a sense of comfort to them without being loaded with fat.

In On Baking we have a recipe for Rice cream with cherry gelée which I habitually make during the summer time. It is refreshing and when piled with fresh pitted cherries it is irresistible. Whenever we prepare Asian style foods at the house, I like to end the meal with a dessert which perfectly flows with the food. One of these is a green tea rice pudding with semi candied strawberries, this is one of my favorite green tea combinations.
Getting It All Together!
Although you can cook the rice a day ahead, I do usually cook it the day I combine it with the other ingredients. Other good flavors to add to green tea rice cream without overpowering the green tea flavor is orange, lemon, grapefruit, calamansi, rose and cherries. For the chocolate decor, mix a desired amount of sifted matcha powder with tempered white chocolate. Once spread sprinkle with prebaked streusel and cut once the chocolate is set like leather.

Title:     Semi Candied Strawberries

For certain desserts I like to use semi candied strawberries. The reason is twofold. One, the flavor is simply incomparable and two, when I make desserts which need to be frozen, semi candied strawberries survive freezing without a hitch.
It would be dishonest to say that semi candied strawberries are not sweet. They are, so when I use these I make certain they are combined with other ingredients which will balance their sweetness. For example, I like to mix semi candied strawberries with fresh raspberries, spoon it on gelato and give it a drizzle of raspberry infused-balsamic vinegar reduction.

Correctly made they are beautiful and if you are faced with strawberries that are disappointing, semi candy them to improve the flavor tremendously.
Getting It All Together!
Semi candied strawberries are quick to make and can be used a few hours after preparation or the following day.

Title:     Pumpkin Crème brûlée

In many countries around the world American classics such as chocolate chip cookies, brownies, muffins and several others have become quite popular.  It would be interesting to know if in a decade or so pumpkin desserts will follow the same path. To be honest, the very first time I tasted pumpkin pie, I was immediately smitten. The whole thing reminded me of a dessert I grew up with in Belgium named Vlaai. Not exactly the same but it still reminds me of it, I call it pure home style unapologetic goodness.

During the Fall, in North America pumpkin pies are very popular and along with pecan pie and sweet potato pie, are served nearly everywhere on the Thanksgiving Holiday. For certain occasions when I need the dessert to be less home style I turn towards pumpkin crème brûlée. Similar ingredients just used in a different ratio.

One of the things I have discovered is that Fresh pumpkins can be tremendous in savory foods but when it comes down to desserts, it is a slightly different story. The leading canned pumpkin manufacturer in the United States has managed to perfect and grow a variety of pumpkins which sweetness, texture and color is ideal for desserts.   Thus I do not fuss with fresh pumpkins unless if I make pumpkin curry soup.
On the ratio of pumpkin to cream… when questioned, most people prefer a crème brûlée with a pumpkin flavor. If what you are looking for is more pumpkin and less crème flavor than I would decrease the cream and increase the pumpkin.
Getting It All Together!
Just as standard Crème brûlée this one can also be made a day or so ahead of time. For the décor use a pumpkin tuile and or caramelized pecans.

Title:     Pumpkin Tuile – Pumpkin Lace Cookie

Since I have a huge affinity towards desserts with pumpkin, I figured it was time to create a pumpkin tuile I could use with pumpkin desserts.  Certainly an orange or maple tuile for pumpkin desserts works fine, but since I already have recipes for such, it would not have had the challenge of testing and retesting this recipe until I had something I had envisioned.
Getting It All Together!
Like most tuiles or lace cookies this one also needs to be protected from humidity. Make the batter and whatever amount is not used place it in a refrigerator or freezer until next times use.

Title:     Orange Ganache Tarts

Whenever I make chocolate ganache tarts I am always afraid that they will be too rich. I always strive to reach a good balance in desserts and sometimes, I feel that ganache tarts can be over the top heavy. One way I like to cut the richness in ganache, is to replace part of the whipping cream with a fruit puree or juice. Not only can this provide an excellent flavor, but it can also add certain finesse. Some fruit purees naturally enhance the fruitiness of chocolate and really bring complexity of flavor.
In this particular instant I replaced part of the cream with concentrated orange juice. Concentrated orange juice? Sure, concentrated orange juice is made by means of using a vacuum and I prefer to use it over reducing orange juice. At times there exceptions! I do not recommend this ganache-as it is formulated, to be used as a large tart. The ganache is soft, even if refrigerated and these tarts are always best when removed from the refrigerator 45 minutes before being served. Thus cutting a large tart and hoping to obtain perfect slices may not become a reality.

These particular tarts were served at a dinner party we recently had and we served it with Clementine (used fresh juice!) and Mandarin Napoleon sorbet. Along with the sorbet, the richness of the tarts was tamed and it just became a luxurious dessert that everyone loved.
Getting It All Together!
The chocolate tart dough can be made weeks in advance and be stored in the freezer. Bake the tart shells the day of serving for optimum results. The ganache is best prepared fresh as it will be silky smooth. The recipe for the chocolate tart dough is in On Baking on page 390.

Title:     Candied Orange Zest

Candied Citrus Zest
For certain chocolates, filled croissant, and dessert in general I like to use candied orange peel. To make it properly and to ensure that the candied peel will keep, it takes about a week to prepare. A long process indeed, but the result is simply amazing. Dipped in bittersweet chocolate, candied orange peel is one of the most luxurious confections in the world. Whenever I am in Bruges I always visit an artisan chocolatier which makes delicious candied orange peel.

Making candied citrus zest as featured in this article, is a whole lot quicker and provides very good results. The main difference between the two is that candied orange peel is made from the entire peel, including the white bitter pith and candied orange zest is made from the outer layer only, the zest. For either one, I only use organic or non treated citrus fruit. It is nice to know that it is not difficult to find organic citrus which is not coated with waxes and treated with chemicals.
Candied citrus zest can be used in numerous ways, swirl it in gelato, spoon it on ice cream, mix it in sauces, mousses, use it to decorate petit fours, mix it into financier or other cake batters…….

Getting It All Together!
Candied citrus zest will last for many months in a well sealed container in the refrigerator or simply freeze it.

Title:     Bavarian Cream | Pomegranate Violet

To me, the beginning of the Fall season is always wonderful. Outdoor temperatures are simply amazing and fruits we have not seen for a while, suddenly appear in our markets.  One fruit that always catches my attention are pomegranates. Their sweet tart flavor is something that I treasure very much and consequently I use pomegranates in countless desserts.  The beautiful red arils can be striking on petit fours or fruit tarts containing other red fruits.

One of my favorite flavor combinations with pomegranate is violet (Violette). The essence of violet can be tricky to find in many places in the world, but luckily violet liqueur is much easier to come by. It adds a delicious floral taste to red fruits such as raspberries or strawberries without making these soapy. Since Bavarian cream is pretty much neutral in flavor it is an excellent candidate to be aromatized by violet and thus pair beautifully with pomegranate.

Assembly:
Prepare the Breton shortbread and set aside. Prepare the Bavarian cream and pour the cream half full into silicone domes. Sprinkle pomegranate arils in the center. Fill with additional Bavarian cream and top with a baked Breton shortbread. Freeze until firm. Unmold and allow to defrost. Serve with the raspberry violet coulis.

Title:     Hibiscus sorbet

A large number of fruit requires specific preparation to enhance them and become truly delicious. Take for example a pluot, when they are ripe they are certainly sweet, but they do have a texture which begs for further enhancement.
When pluots are not fully ripe, I prefer to poach them in sweet white wine enhanced by a few dried hibiscus flowers. Hibiscus is a favorite of mine to accent the flavor of pluots. Poaching softens the texture perfectly and when served with gelato or other creams it simply makes a very delicious dessert.
When I have perfectly ripe pluots on hand, I choose to sauté them in honey and lime juice which is truly wonderful. In this case I bring in Hibiscus via sorbet.


Hibiscus makes a very flavorful and gorgeous colored sorbet. What I like about hibiscus is that although it is a flower, it has a fresh edge, a crispness which many other floral lack. We all know perfectly well that many people object to certain dried flowers in food and find them soapy and simply unappealing. The hibiscus sorbet is low on sugar which makes it a perfect candidate to be served as soon it is made for optimum smoothness.  Adding raspberry puree to hibiscus sorbet creates amazing results as well.
Getting it all together!
Choose ripe pluots for this dessert. Find the streusel recipe on pg 395, in On Baking, second edition. Struesel can be made weeks in advance and frozen in a well sealed container. For the decorative caramel ring find recipe in On Baking, pg 729.

Title:     Dessert in a Glass

Cherries topped with chocolate Port sauce and hazelnut streusel
One of the things I like about serving a dessert in a glass or verrine is that no special equipment is needed. All you basically need is a modern style glass and you are set to go to make a contemporary dessert. The other and most important reason is that a glass allows options which may not be possible if the dessert is made other than in a glass. Take for example mousses and creams of all kinds, if made into molds these usually will need a higher amount of setting agent (gelatin, chocolate, cocoa butter, agar, eggs etc) compared to a cream destined to go directly in a glass.  Softer creams are always more wonderful on the palate, no one can argue with that.

For this dessert I covered the cherries with a delicious chocolate Port sauce. Cherries pair wonderfully with chocolate and the Port enhances and deepens the flavor of the cherries beautifully. Something else that works perfectly with cherries is hazelnuts and therefore the cherries are topped with hazelnut streusel. For the vanilla cream I selected a Panna cotta flavored with Kirsch liquor but a Bavarian cream or a vanilla gelato would be just great as well.
Getting It All Together!
Panna cotta can easily be made a day ahead and kept in the refrigerator. The chocolate port sauce will last for at least a week in a refrigerator and the streusel can be frozen unbaked. Simply bake what you need.

Title:     Liquor Filled Chocolates

Liquor filled chocolates intimidating, difficult or confusing to make? Not really.
Liquor filled chocolates can be made in a variety of ways and the method I describe here is certainly my favorite.  It is my preferred process for a variety of reasons but mainly it is a texture issue.  Most often Liquor filled chocolates are made with a crystallized sugar crust which I find, gives a poor and unpleasant mouth experience. In chocolates I like all types of crisp textures (Nougatine, nuts, toffee, caramel etc) however; it is crystallized sugar which I find to be completely incompatible with chocolate.




The one advantage that liquor filled chocolate with a starch made crystallized sugar crust have is that they have a long shelf life. Much longer compared to the ones I feature here. The reason for this is that a starch made crystallized sugar crust prevents the liquor syrup from getting in contact with the chocolate. Without this crust the liquor syrup weakens the chocolate shell and therefore these types of chocolates need to be consumed within a few days up to one week. However one of the gains with this method, is that the syrup does not have to contain the same (high) sugar concentration to ensure that proper crystallization will take place.  Consequently these liquor filled chocolates offer a wider array of liquors which can be used. Time wise this method allows for making liquor filled chocolates from start to finish within an hour.


Getting It All Together!
You can make the chocolate shells and liquor syrup days in advance. Keep both in a cool environment but not a refrigerator. Ensure you have confectionery fondant on hand to seal the chocolates.

Place a piece of candied orange peel in each chocolate cup. If using a very small piece chances are that the peel will float to the surface. Use a small amount of crystallized chocolate to “Adhere” the candied peel in the cup and thus prevent floating.
Fill the cups with the liquor syrup ensuring no dripping on the edges.
Cream the butter with the fondant and warm the mixture to make it very runny.
Pipe a thin layer of the mixture onto the syrup which will automatically flout to the surface. Allow to firm at room temperature-this will only take minutes.
Seal the chocolates with a small amount of chocolate thinned with the addition of 15% of grapeseed oil.
The chocolates do not need to be refrigerated.

Title:     Hazelnut shortbread

For certain events a professional pastry chef is often faced with having to prepare bite size cookies which are attractive looking and at the same time delicious. Shortbread is usually a good candidate for such instance since they have an undeniable elegance about them.
The shortbread featured here is in many places in the world called a petit four sec.  Dipping the shortbread in crystallized chocolate is optional but it is something I prefer to do since it elevates something which is rather simple to something exceptional.
Getting it all together!
Unbaked shortbread freezes very well and thus can easily be made in advance. Once baked it is best the day it is made. However, when well packaged it does last several days.  You can certainly dip the entire shortbread in chocolate and thus extending the shelf life even further.


Hazelnut shortbread
Note: Protein or gluten content varies in flour, even within a specific type and thus has an effect on the final texture. Since shortbread is all about the texture it may be necessary to slightly adjust the amount of flour and or replace part of the flour with corn starch.

Title:     Cold Brewed Coffee Gelee

During the summer months I always infuse or “brew” cold coffee at our home. The full and dynamic flavor with low acidity that cold brewed coffee provides is something that I love.  Infusing cold allows you to detect flavor nuances in the coffee which are nearly impossible to detect when brewed hot. Ordinarily I pour some of the cold infused coffee concentrate in some water with a touch of sugar and cream and serve it on the rocks.
At times I will add a touch of gelatin to cold brewed coffee and serve as dessert. Along with a small crème brûlée or a small amount of vanilla or chocolate gelato it is very delicious.
To make cold brewed coffee it is important to start off with excellent coffee which has no bitter or harsh undertones. My preference to use is espresso made by Kimbo ®; this Italian coffee has slight chocolate and buttery undertones which are perfect for this dessert.
Getting it all together!
The brewing or infusing process takes 12 hours so do this step ahead. The infusion will last for a week in the refrigerator.

Title:     Strawberry Gelato

The combination of strawberries and a balsamic vinegar reduction is a classic for good reason, made with ripe and flavorful strawberries it is simply amazing. For a while now I have been thinking on how to make the strawberry-balsamic reduction work in a frozen entremet or ice cream cake. After several experiments and fine tuning I must say that this particular frozen entremet is really, really good. At times strawberry ice cream can make you long for a deeper strawberry flavor, but not here, this hybrid of gelato and sorbet is rich and robust in flavor.

The sweetness of the meringue is dually tamed here, first by the addition of cocoa nibs and second by the balsamic vinegar, which is the perfect accompaniment to the strawberry flavor.
Getting It All Together!
Prepare the meringue up to a week in advance, store airtight to maintain crispness. Assemble the frozen entremet or frozen ice cream cake a full day before serving, this will allow proper firming in the ring.
Assembly: Upside down
Prepare a French meringue as described in On Baking, second edition on page 414and fold in 3 oz (90 g) cocoa nibs along with second amount of granulated sugar. Pipe into circles, slightly smaller of the rings diameter. Bake as described and trim slightly after baking to make the meringue slightly smaller than the ring.
Place a ring on a patterned silform and set aside.
Fill the bottom of the ring with just churned strawberry gelato. Place a meringue layer onto the gelato. Fill with a small amount of gelato and then the balsamic reduction. More gelato and finish off with the meringue disk. Freeze overnight.
Turn upside down and unmold with the use of a torch.

Title:     Chocolate Caramels

Salted chocolate caramels
A good chocolate cream caramel is not only delicious it is also very addicting. At times I prepare them with pre-toasted hazelnut which is just as with salt, an irresistible combination. Caramels can be a little finicky to prepare, undercooked and they will not cut properly, overcooked and they will be too firm. If cooked too slowly they may turn grainy, cooked too fast in a poorly made pot and the caramel may burn! It is clear to see why some people find them too much trouble.

For caramels you need a good pot to cook the mixture in. I prefer to cook caramel on an induction cook top over gas. (But then again I prefer induction for most things I do in the kitchen) If I had a rounded bottom copper pot perhaps then I would use gas. Induction cooks very fast and bothersome gas flames will not flare up along the sides of the pot.

Getting it all together!
Preferably prepare the caramel a day or at least 5 hours before dipping in crystallized couverture chocolate. Making it a day ahead will make the cutting a lot easier and the caramel will be less sticky.
Chocolate Caramels Recipe

As needed
(A/S)
Fleur de sel
As needed


























2 lb
2 lb
Semi sweet chocolate couverture

Place candy rulers in a 10 inch (25 cm) square pattern on a Silpat which is placed on a marble.
Combine the first 5 listed ingredients in a heavy bottom –well made pan and while constantly stirring boil to 250F 121C.
Pour the caramel quickly between the rulers. Do not scrape the bowl! Scraping remnants out the bowl can very quickly make the caramel turn grainy.
Let the caramel set preferably overnight.
Cut into desired shapes and dip in crystallized (tempered) chocolate couverture and sprinkle with fleur de sel.

Title:     Flour Free Chocolate Cake

To make certain bakery items gluten free it may be necessary to replace wheat flour with tapioca, rice, bean and or other flours, but at times, great results can also be obtained without using any of these at all. Case in point this featured chocolate hazelnut layer cake, which is moist, all natural and has a perfect texture.

Oftentimes we forget that cocoa powder contains a good amount of starch and fiber, ingredients which absorb moisture and are part of the cake building structure. Therefore making a cake without flour in case of a chocolate cake is not very complicated. In fact by simply manipulating the ingredients a perfect chocolate cake without flour can easily be obtained.



Getting it all together!
If you want to obtain sharply cut sides on the cake it is best to bake, fill and assemble the cake and then freeze it. Frost it the next day with room temperature ganache than freeze it, give it a second coat with heated ganache or cocoa gelée and cut while frozen.
Chocolate Cake without Flour
Yield: 1 full sheet pan



12
(8   oz)
Egg   yolks
240   g


1 tsp
(1   tsp)
Vanilla extract
5 ml


12
(12   oz)
Egg whites
360   g


1 ½ Cups
(12   oz)
Extra fine granulated sugar
360   g


½ Cup
(4   oz)
Cocoa powder, sifted
120   g








1 Cup
(4   oz)
Toasted hazelnut or almond flour
120 g






































































Whip the egg yolks to a mousse consistency, add the vanilla and set aside.
Whip the egg whites and granulated sugar to stiff peaks
Right before folding the egg yolks into the egg whites give the egg whites a good whip to make them “creamy” and make it easier for the remaining ingredients to be homogenized into the batter. Gently fold the yolks into the egg whites. It is not necessary to fold the mixture until all the yolk streaks are gone.
Gently fold in the cocoa powder and nut flour.
Spread the batter on a parchment lined full sheet pan and bake in a 350F (180C) oven until the cake bounces back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.




Assembly:

Once cooled cut the cake crosswise in 4 equal strips. Spread low sugar raspberry jam (On Baking pg 620) on one layer and cover with another layer. Repeat until all used. Do not cover with jam on the top layer.
Spread a thin layer of room temperature ganache (On Baking page 494) on the surface.
If desired coat with a layer of heated Cocoa gelée (On Baking pg 560) for a brilliant finish.
Cut into desired size.

Title:     Creme Chiboust

Chocolate Crème chiboust
One of the things I love about a well made Crème Chiboust is that it allows the flavor it contains to really shine through. The primary reason why a crème chiboust has a well pronounced flavor is that it is much lower in fat compared to many other mousses. Fat tends to coat our taste buds making it harder to fully taste the flavor nuances.
Essentially, a crème chiboust is nothing more than a just prepared (and still hot) pastry cream lightened with a (still warm) Italian style meringue. Using an Italian Meringue over a regular cold made meringue is my preferred method since it provides better stability of the cream.

For this particular dessert I used star anise, a much underused spice witch pairs excellently with oranges or kumquats. The combination of the fruit and star anise is not only refined but also works gloriously with the chocolate crème chiboust.
Getting it all together!
If serving the dessert as shown in the picture make the chocolate crème chiboust and the star anise panna cotta a day ahead and freeze overnight. Cut it into desired shapes. If serving the dessert in a verrine you can make the chiboust the day of serving just allow a few hours for chilling.
The recipe For the chocolate caramel decor can be found on my site as well by clicking the link.

In a saucepan bring the milk to a boil.
In a separate bowl whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Add sugar (a) and whisk rapidly until smooth, add cornstarch and whisk smooth. Whisk in half of the boiling milk.
Pour the egg yolk mixture into the remaining boiling milk and whisk rapidly to a boil. Boil for 1 minute and remove from heat. Stir in the chocolate and bloomed gelatin. (Blooming gelatin is achieved by placing gelatin sheets in ice cold water for 5-10 minutes to soften, and then squeeze out excess water.)
Cover the crème with plastic food film and do not place in an ice bath. Simply keep at room temperature.
Immediately prepare the Italian Meringue: In a saucepan bring the sugar (b), invert sugar and water to a boil, wash away any sugar crystals.
Place the egg whites in a machine bowl fitted with a whip attachment and whip on low speed.
 When the sugar syrup has reached 250°F (121°C) remove from heat and whip the egg whites in high speed. Pour the syrup along the inner edge of the bowl in a steady stream.
Whip until lukewarm and remove from machine.
Quickly whisk the chocolate cream to make perfectly smooth and in increments fold in the Italian meringue.
Mold as desired. (Here the crème Chiboust was spread on a silicone lined sheet ½ Inch (1.2 cm) thick)
Freeze and cut into desired shapes. Spray with chocolate spray.

Title:     Belgian Waffles

Golden crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside with a near see thru appearance are the characteristics of a perfect waffle.
In Belgium, this type of waffle is known as the Brussels waffle where it is very popular. The Belgian or Brussels waffle was first introduced in 1856 at the fair in Brussels, although other types of waffles had been around for a much longer time.  In fact a waffle iron can be seen on a painting by Pieter Breughel, dating back to 1559.

Traditionally waffles in Belgium are consumed as a dessert and served with powdered sugar, whipped cream, butter, ice cream, chocolate sauce, fruits etc. In the United States most people consume waffles for breakfast. In our home we serve waffles both for weekend breakfast (piled with lots of fresh fruit) and for dessert.
Getting it all together!
Since yeast is involved with this type of waffle it takes time to for this batter to reach perfection, therefore, if you are planning to serve this type of waffle for breakfast it is best to make these during the day and simply freeze them. Defrosting is quick and once they come out of the toaster they are still very good. If you serve them for dessert or an afternoon snack make them fresh!

Title:     Chocolate Decor

Many pastry students have asked if I could spend a few topics on chocolate decoration techniques so here is the first one. The décor featured here is one of my favorites since it has a contemporary feel and at the same time it is very organic almost crude in appearance. On modern style entremet I love the juxtaposition of slick with organic.
This type of chocolate décor can be made with non crystallized or untempered chocolate but best results will be obtained if you do use crystallized chocolate. Using crystallized chocolate will allow you to make these décor in advance and store them at 63°F (17°C) without the risk of the décor taking on a dull appearance. At slightly higher temps the décor should last at least a week.
For certain chocolate decorations a room temperature marble slab is used along with crystallized chocolate. However, for the decoration highlighted here, a marble slab is used which is placed in a freezer for at least one hour. Once chocolate is spread on a super cold marble slab it crystallizes quickly, but in an incomplete state which allows us to shape the chocolate in various ways.
Getting It All Together!

1. Temper or crystallize chocolate. Remove marble slab from freezer and scrape away any condensation. Pipe chocolate on marble slab.

2. Using a pastry comb spread chocolate in thin strips.

3. Using a pastry wheel or paring knife cut into desired size.

4. Lift the chocolate off the marble and turn upside down.

5. Roll the chocolate decor while still soft.
