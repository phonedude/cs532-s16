\subsection{Answer}
As was illustrated in the original study of Zachary's karate club, \cite{wzach77}, a prediction of the structure of the club if a separation were to occur can be made with a high degree of accuracy using weighted edges based on the perceived ``strength'' of each relationship it modeled. The prediction method outlined in the original paper was an implementation of the \textit{maximum flow-minimum cut labeling procedure} \cite{forful62}. The pickled \cite{py:pickle} dataset of the existing karate club, with weights for each edge, was obtained from \url{http://nexus.igraph.org/api/dataset_info?id=1&format=html} and used to create the graph shown in Figure \ref{fig:existing_graph}.

The actual structure of the two resulting clubs after the split are shown in Figure \ref{fig:actual}.

To predict a separation of the existing graph into two or more distinct community components a pair of community detection algorithms will be employed and the results will be compared to the actual results of the split from Zachary's original study \cite{wzach77}. Community Detection was chosen as a means for predicting the results of fission events because it is logical that a given community would less likely be split along strong inter-community edges than those weaker, community-spanning edges.

The first algorithm used was the Edge Betweenness algorithm, developed by Girvan and Newman \cite{girnew04}. This is a divisive algorithm that removes edges that have the highest betweenness measure because these tend to be community-spanning edges.

\label{fig:graph_eb}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
Edge Betweenness method results: 
Variant elements:
	[3, 14]
94.12% accuracy
\end{verbatim}

As you can see this method is fairly accurate, with over 94\% of the prediction being correct.

The second method used was the Leading Eigenvector algorithm developed my M. Newman \cite{new06}. This method uses a special matrix, called the modularity matrix, to determine which edges to remove.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{q1/clust_le.pdf}}
\caption{Prediction of Leading Eigenvector Algorithm}
\label{fig:graph_le}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
Leading Eigenvector method results: 
Variant elements:
	[]
100.0 % accuracy
\end{verbatim}

This method proves 100\% efficacy in its prediction.
