Repeat \#6, but IMDB data from approximately July 31, 2005.  What
is the cumulative error (in days) from the desired target day of
July 31, 2005?  For example, if 1 memento is from July 1, 2005 and 
another memento is from July 31, 2006, then the cumulative error 
for the two mementos is 30 days $+$ 365 days = 385 days.\\
