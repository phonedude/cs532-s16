Rank the 1,682 movies according to the 1997/1998 MovieLense
data.  Now rank the same 1,682 movies according to todays (March
2016) IMDB data (break ties based on \# of users, for example: 7.2
with 10,000 raters $>$ 7.2 with 9,000 raters).\\

Draw a graph, where each dot is a film (i.e., 1,682 dots).  The
x-axis is the MovieLense ranking and the y-axis is today's IMDB
ranking.\\

after nearly 20 years?
