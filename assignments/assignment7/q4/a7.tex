Choose your (the real you, not the substitute you) favorite and
least favorite film from the data.  For each film, generate a list
of the top 5 most correlated and bottom 5 least correlated films.
Based on your knowledge of the resulting films, do you agree with
the results?  In other words, do you personally like / dislike
the resulting films?
