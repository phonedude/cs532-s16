Question 4 was solved using the code shown in Listing \ref{listing:q4},, with the {\tt pearson} and the {\tt get\_avg} functions from Listings \ref{listing:mpearson} and \ref{listing:avg}, respectively. The {\tt get\_avg} function uses the {\tt mean} function from the numpy python library \cite{py:numpy}.\\
\\
The results for Question 4 are shown in Table \ref{tab:fav} and \ref{tab:nfav}. \\

The recommendations results are not amazing to me. As expressed in {\tt User \textcolor{blue}{135} was selected as substitute me}\ref{tab:substitute} arrangement user \textcolor{blue}{135} is nearest to me of course. Be that as it may, the outcomes are close in wording how I feel about {\tt substitute me} ranking. I hate all movies not recommended and the recommended ones I would rate them somewhere around 2 and 3, like the most astounding ranking for user \textcolor{blue}{135}.
