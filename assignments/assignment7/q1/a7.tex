The goal of this project is to use the basic recommendation principles
we have learned for user-collected data. You will modify the code
given to you which performs movie recommendations from the MovieLense
data sets.\\
\\
The MovieLense data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research
Project at the University of Minnesota during the seven-month period
from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998.  We are using the
\enquote{100k dataset}; available for download from:\\
\url{http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
}\\
\\
The code for reading from the u.data and u.item files and creating
recommendations is described in the book Programming Collective
Intelligence.  Feel free to modify the PCI code to answer the 
following questions.\\
\\
Find 3 users who are closest to you in terms of age, 
gender, and occupation.  For each of those 3 users:\\
\\
- what are their top 3 favorite films?\\
- bottom 3 least favorite films?\\
\\
Based on the movie values in those 6 tables (3 users X (favorite $+$
least)), choose a user that you feel is most like you.  Feel 
free to note any outliers (e.g., \enquote{I mostly identify with user 123,
except I did not like \enquote{Ghost} at ll}).  \\
\\
This user is the \enquote{substitute you}.
