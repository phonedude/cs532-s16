1.  We know the result of the Karate Club (Zachary, 1977) split.
Prove or disprove that the result of split could have been predicted
by the weighted graph of social interactions.  How well does the
mathematical model represent reality?

Generously document your answer with all supporting equations, code,
graphs, arguments, etc.

2.  We know the group split in two different groups.  Suppose the
disagreements in the group were more nuanced -- what would the clubs
look like if they split into groups of 3, 4, and 5?
