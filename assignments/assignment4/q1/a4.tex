Determine if the friendship paradox holds for my Facebook
account.\* Compute the mean, standard deviation, and median of the
number of friends that my friends have.  Create a graph of the
number of friends (y-axis) and the friends themselves, sorted by
number of friends (x-axis).  (The friends don't need to be labeled
on the x-axis: just f1, f2, f3, ... fn.)  Do include me in the graph
and label me accordingly.\\
\\
\* \= This used to be more interesting when you could more easily download
your friend's friends data from Facebook.  Facebook now requires each
friend to approve this operation, effectively making it impossible.\\

I will email to the list the XML file that contains my Facebook
friendship graph ca. Oct, 2013.  The interesting part of the file looks
like this (for 1 friend):
\\
\lstinputlisting[language=XML, stepnumber=0, linerange={803-809},frame=none,caption={mln.graphml}, label=listing:mln.graphml]{q1/mln.graphml}

It is in GraphML format: \url{http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/}
