Determine if the friendship paradox holds for your Twitter account.
Since Twitter is a directed graph, use \enquote{followers} as value you measure 
$($i.e., \enquote{do your followers have more followers than you?}$)$.\\
\\
Generate the same graph as in question \#1, and calcuate the same 
mean, standard deviation, and median values.\\
\\
For the Twitter 1.1 API to help gather this data, see:

\url{https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/followers/list}
\\
If you do not have followers on Twitter (or don't have more than 50),
then use my twitter account \enquote{phonedude\_mln}.
