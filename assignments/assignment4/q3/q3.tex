\input{q3/a4}

\subsection{Answer}
Fortunately, {\it linkedIn} provides information about connections (people) through an API (\url{https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer}. I have written a Python program,
{\it qet\_linkedin}, that requests data from {\it linkedIn} and saves the output into linkedin\_count.

I would like indicate here that the API that LinkedIn provides returns no more than 500 connection. In other words, if I have someone in my connection has more than 500 connections. LinkedIn will give me this person has 500+.

The {\tt linkedin\_count} file was ordered in place with the Unix command in Listing \ref{listing:sort2}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash,caption={Sort command},label=listing:sort2]
Naina Sai Tipparti@DESKTOP-2FU7AJC ~/a4/q3 cat linkedin_count | sort -g -o linkedin_count
\end{lstlisting}

This file was then processed by the R script shown in Listing \ref{listing:linkedin_graphr} to produce the graph in Figure \ref{fig:linkedin_graph}

I have number of connections which is a way less than the mean, but we can not conclude from the above statistics that the friendship paradox holds for My LinkedIn account since must of my connections have connections greater the mean.
