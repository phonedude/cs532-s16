\input{q1/a9}

\subsection{Answer}

To obtain the blog entries required for this assignment, the {\tt matrix.py} script was again used to download the blog entries from ``Kevin's XL \& Disc Golf Chronicles'', a blog written by Kevin Morrow about his motorcycling and disc golfing exploits. The categories I came up with for each blog entry are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item game: recreational game(s) of disc golf
	\item tourney: tournament round(s)
	\item motorcycles: anything related to riding/owning motorcycles
	\item event: community events/cookouts
	\item diy: disc dyes/graphic design
\end{enumerate}

The script downloaded entries from the atom feed \cite{atom} of the blog until a total of 100 entries were retrieved. It parsed each entry's title and saved them as a list to the {\tt blog\_content} file which will later be used for training the fisher classifier in Question 2.
