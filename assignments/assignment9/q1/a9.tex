Choose a blog or a newsfeed (or something similar with an Atom
or RSS feed).  Every student should do a unique feed, so please \enquote{claim} the feed on the class email list (first come, first served).
It should be on a topic or topics of which you are qualified to
provide classification training data.  Find something with at least
100 entries (or items if RSS).\\
\\
Create between four and eight different categories for the entries
in the feed:\\
\\
examples: \\
\\
work, class, family, news, deals\\
\\
liberal, conservative, moderate, libertarian\\
\\
sports, local, financial, national, international, entertainment\\
\\
metal, electronic, ambient, folk, hip-hop, pop\\
\\
Download and process the pages of the feed as per the week 12 
class slides.\\

Be sure to upload the raw data (Atom or RSS) to your github account.
