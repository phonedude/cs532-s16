Boeing is Cutting Jobs in Its Commercial Airplane Unit

   Boeing [30]ba said on Wednesday it would cut jobs at its commercial
   airplane unit, addressing intense pressure to reduce costs and compete
   with Airbus even as the industry booms.

   Boeing and Airbus are turning out planes at record rates, and plan to
   boost output in coming years as they work through backlogged orders
   that stretch out seven or eight years.

   [31]But last year Airbus won 57% of new orders booked by the two
   airplane makers. Boeing’s operating profit margin also narrowed to 3.5%
   in the fourth quarter, from 9.3% a year earlier. Factors included the
   [32]high cost of producing its state-of-the-art 787 Dreamliner and a
   charge it took to account for slowing sales of its 747 jumbo.

   “To win in the market, fund our growth and operate as a healthy
   business, we are taking thoughtful steps to reduce the cost of
   designing and building our airplanes, part of which involves evaluating
   our employment levels across all of commercial airplanes,” Boeing said
   after its Airplanes chief, Ray Conner, announced the move in an
   employee webcast.

   “We will start reducing employment levels beginning with executives and
   managers first.”

   Conner also said Boeing may decide this year about developing an
   aircraft to fill a gap between its biggest 737 and the smallest 787
   Dreamliner to compete with Airbus in that segment of the market.

   Boeing did not set a time frame for job cuts and said the number “will
   depend on how effectively we bring down costs as a whole.”

   Once based in Seattle, Boeing has already cut about 4,000 jobs in
   Washington state and has come under fire there after receiving a major
   package of tax incentives in 2013 linked to job growth.


   Washington state granted Boeing tax breaks in exchange for the
   company’s decision to put a new aircraft program, the 777X, in the
   Seattle area to “maintain and grow” aerospace employment.

   Washington state remains the center of Boeing’s commercial airplane
   operations, and employment has tended to rise when production booms.
   But this time, Boeing is producing record numbers of planes with fewer
   workers than in the past.

   [33]Employment has fallen as the company sent work to other states and
   countries, reorganized engineering talent around the world and stepped
   up automation and lean manufacturing.
