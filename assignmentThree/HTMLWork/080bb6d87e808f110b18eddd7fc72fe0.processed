CONGRESSWOMAN SHEILA JACKSON LEE STATEMENT REGARDING THE PASSAGE OF HR 759 -
THE CORRECTIONS AND RECIDIVISM REDUCTION ACT OF 2016 - OUT OF THE HOUSE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

   Feb 11, 2016
   Press Release

   Washington, DC – Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a senior member of
   the House Judiciary and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary
   Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and
   Investigations, released the following statement after the House
   Judiciary Committee passed HR 759 the Corrections and Recidivism
   Reduction Act of 2016 today:

   “Today in the House Judiciary Committee we took a great step towards
   achieving our next step in Criminal Justice Reform. One of the most
   important aspects of reform is the treatment of prisoners while they
   are incarcerated is to make them better citizens when they are released
   from jail.

   “A recidivist is a person who is released from prison and who later
   commits another crime, or reoffends, such as a parole violation or the
   commission of a new crime. It is estimated that 73% of the recidivists
   released from prison and jails today committed a new crime or violated
   parole within the first year of their release. This current rate of
   recidivism reflects a complete failure of the prison system to achieve
   intended goals of deterrence and rehabilitation.

   “Included in this bipartisan legislation are the following provisions
   that I personally made sure were included in this important Bill:
     * Expansion of definition of “prisoners” to include all DC inmates,
       juveniles (and juvenile delinquents), and anyone in contract
       facilities.
     * Expansion of “recidivism reduction program” to allow for pilot and
       innovative programs, in addition to a broadening of the programming
       list (see above).
     * Requirement that risk assessment include an evaluation of housing
       assignment to ensure people with similar risks are housed together
       and to decrease crowding at high security facilities.
     * Inclusion of video conference as an incentive for completing
       programming.
     * Granting prisoners earned time credits for pre-sentencing
       programming.
     * Limiting the recidivist drug trafficking exclusion to those
       individuals who have had a meaningful opportunity to participate in
       the programs under this Act, i.e. even if you are a third time drug
       trafficker, if you haven’t had a chance to participate then you are
       not excluded from earning time credits.
     * Requirement that the Attorney General review the administrative
       processes related to “recidivism reduction partners,” i.e.
       reviewing the process for these groups to get into the prisons or
       for prisoners to participate with the groups.
     * Right to seek reconsideration of a determination that one is “more
       likely than not to recidivate” and thus ineligible to redeem
       credits.

   “Recidivism is a multi-tiered problem with no easy answer. The
   bipartisan legislation passed in the House Judiciary Committee today is
   an excellent first step in the direction to helping former inmates. The
   bill not only rehabilitates and enhances the safety of communities but
   it also reflects many of the provisions that I fought for including
   parenting skills and re-entry plans to name a few. Numerous studies
   have shown prison program systems providing institutional programming
   have lower recidivism rates among those who are released. Prison
   programs such as anger management, vocational skills training,
   educational opportunities, and even trauma support groups are vital to
   ensuring inmates who are reintroduced to the general population have
   the life skills necessary to stay on the right path.

   “Reducing the rate of recidivism of inmates returning to our
   communities is in the best interest of society because we will be
   making sure those returning home no longer pose a threat or a public
   safety risk.”
