Scientists use laser to "weld" neurons together

   Whether it's as a research tool or a step in repairing severed nerves,
   the ability to join neurons together has some serious applications. If
   left to occur naturally, the process takes several hours, limiting its
   practicality. Now, however, scientists at the University of Alberta's
   Faculty of Engineering have developed a method of doing so within 15
   milliseconds.

   Led by PhD student Nir Katchinskiy, the team started with two neurons,
   suspended in a solution that allowed them to touch but not stick
   together. A series of ultrashort femtosecond laser pulses were then
   applied to the point where the two nerve cells met.

   As a result, the cells formed a common membrane at that meeting point,
   melding them together like conjoined twins. Even after multiple
   experiments, the neurons stayed connected and viable. There was some
   external damage to the protective layer surrounding each of them, but
   the inside surface of that layer remained intact.

   "The immediate application is for researchers," says Katchinskiy. "They
   finally have a new tool to do what they have not been able to do
   before."

   Although the technique probably won't be capable of reconnecting
   severed spinal cords anytime soon, the university has stated that it
   could be a step in that direction.

   A paper on the research was recently published in the journal
   [23]Nature Scientific Reports.
