   A regional sports complex could be a catalyst for further growth in a
   burgeoning Fitchburg neighborhood, but the city's mayor wants to see
   more information about financing and more interest from residents.

   GK Sports and Entertainment of Indiana has proposed building an
   4,200-seat arena and a 330,000-square-foot field house in the Uptown
   Fitchburg development near Highway 14 and Lacy Road to attract youth
   and adult sports events.

   In a public information meeting last November, representatives of the
   company painted a picture for Fitchburg residents and public officials
   of a sports and entertainment hub at the corner of Lacy Road and East
   Cheryl Parkway that could draw thousands of visitors to the area every
   year.

   But Mayor Steve Arnold said he's not willing to commit public money for
   the project until he hears a public outcry in support of it.

   "I would definitely say that we're not ready to pull the trigger on
   this yet," he said. "We have a lot to learn about the project."

   At the November informational meeting, Barry Kiesel of GK Sports and
   Entertainment said the sports complex concept is intended to attract
   some of the roughly 35 million youth athletes that travel for sporting
   events in the U.S. each year.

   He said the indoor, year-round facility can host 31 different sports
   with a variety of surfaces, from ice in the arena to artificial turf
   and courts in the field house.

   That could be a draw for Olympic sports training as well as youth
   travel team circuits, Kiesel said.

   Fitchburg sports complex proposal
   A screenshot from a proposal given at Fitchburg's city hall on Nov. 18,
   2015, shows an example of the setup of a sports complex by GK Sports
   and Entertainment.

   He said GK Sports pays for about 70 percent of the $77 million project
   cost, leaving the city to cover the remainder through tax increment
   financing. Hotels and restaurants also could be incorporated into the
   project to bring the total price tag to $125 million.

   GK Sports has plans to build a number of similar facilities in the
   Midwest to add to the number of locations that can host regional and
   national sports tournaments.

   In Fishers, Indiana, [65]questions about funding delayed city approval
   of the plan last year.

   Reached this week, Kiesel said his company was working through the
   proposal with Fitchburg and referred comment to city officials.

   Arnold said he saw two major sticking points with the Fitchburg
   proposal.

   The first is the tax-incremental financing involved, on top of a TIF
   district that already exists for the Uptown development.

   "There's a pretty strong sentiment that we've done enough and now it's
   the private sector's turn," Arnold said.

   The second is the cost of public services for the center and questions
   on whether the rest of the community would take on a disproportionate
   share.

   "The thing that would make this really riveting and interesting to the
   council and me and more interesting to the general taxpayers of the
   city would be if it could be reenvisioned so that it did not require
   such a big public ask," Arnold said.

   The 450-acre Uptown Fitchburg development between Highway 14 and Syene
   Road south of Madison was sparked by the new interchange at Lacy Road
   that opened in 2012.

   The neighborhood is projected to eventually include residential units
   for 4,000 people as well as employment and retail destinations, said
   Chris Armstrong, president of principal developer Avante Properties.

   He described Uptown as a "urban form based neighborhood" that
   encourages walking and biking with easy access to residences,
   recreation and employment.

   The proximity to downtown Madison is one of the big selling points, he
   said.

   The 177-unit RIVA Apartments building is open and the 64-unit first
   phase of the PRIMA Apartments is scheduled to open in May, he said. An
   urban grocery store is planned to be part of a six-story mixed-use
   building targeted for construction in 2017, and a hotel is on the
   docket outside of the sports complex plans.

   Armstrong said visitors brought in by a sports complex could be a
   catalyst for future restaurants, hotels and other amenities that new
   residents have been asking for.

   "The sports complex would do that overnight, in a heartbeat," he said.
   "It would turn it into an entertainment district."

   Armstrong said the numbers that struck him in GK Sports' proposal were
   from the Fishers development, which he said had 41 events pre-booked
   that worked out to $28 million in direct spending.

   Some potential user groups have lobbied city staff in favor of the
   project, Arnold said. But the mayor said those views don't necessarily
   represent the Fitchburg citizens who would forgo the tax revenue in a
   TIF deal.

   Arnold said GK Sports' proposal could be discussed at a committee of
   the whole meeting in March.

   "Common Council members and I and city staff are all eager to learn
   more about what's being proposed and what is firm and what's more
   speculative and how Fishers is coming along and things like that,"
   Arnold said.
