        pyramid_mailer is a package for sending email from your Pyramid application.
        It is compatible with Python 2.6. 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, as well as PyPy
        and PyPy3.
        
        This package includes:
        
        1. Wrapping the low-level Python ``email`` library with an easy-to-use
           API, which includes attachments and mulipart content.
        
        2. Send emails immediately or to add to a maildir queue.
        
        3. Managing email sends inside a transaction, to prevent emails being sent
           if your code raises an exception.
        
        4. Features to help with unit testing.
        
        ``pyramid_mailer`` uses the ``repoze.sendmail`` library for managing email
        sending and transacton management, and borrows code (with permission) from
        Zed Shaw's ``lamson`` for wrapping email messages (http://lamsonproject.org/).
        See the LICENSE.txt file for more information.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.14.1 (2015-05-21)
        -------------------
        
        - Enable compatibility testing with Pyramid all the way back to 1.2. It may
          work earlier but we aren't testing it any longer.
        
        - Fix a bug where the ``mailer.debug`` ini option was not properly being
          cast to an ``int``. This did not show up on Python 2 because string
          to int comparisons are valid there but it was a latent bug.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_mailer/pull/68
        
        0.14 (2014-12-10)
        -----------------
        
        - Added support for Python3.4, PyPy3.
        
        - Pull #56: Ensure that ``DebugMailer`` emulates ``Mailer`` by generating
          a sender if none is passed.
        
        - Pull #52: Add configuration options for ``mail.sendmail_app`` and
          ``mail.sendmail_template`` to allow use with non-default sendmail
          configurations.
        
        - Pull #50: Add ``pyramid_mailer.debug`` shorthand:  via one line in
          ``development.ini``, enables writing emails to a file instead of sending
          them.
        
        0.13 (2013-07-13)
        -----------------
        
        - Pull #45:  Default transfer encoding for mail messages is now
          'quoted-printable'.
        
        0.12 (2013-06-26)
        -----------------
        
        - Pull #35:  aadded support for sendmail binary via repoze.sendmail >= 4.0b2.
        
        - Remove "all_parts" and "attach_all_parts" from MailResponse object (unused by
          pyramid_mailer).
        
        - The Attachment class no longer supports reading data from the a file based on
          the ``filename`` it is passed.  Instead, use the filename argument only as
          something that should go in the Content-Disposition header, and pass a
          filelike object as ``data``.
        
        - Major code overhaul: nonascii attachment sending now actually works, most of
          the code stolen from Lamson was gutted and replaced.
        
        - Requires repoze.sendmail >= 4.1
        
        0.11 (2013-03-28)
        -----------------
        
        - Issue #29: Allow setting Content-Transfer-Encoding for body and html
          via Attachments.
        
        - Issue #32: Fix handling of messages with both HTML and plain text
          bodies that also have attachments.
        
        - Issue #24:  ensure that ``pyramid_mailer.response.to_message`` returns
          text under Python 3.x.
        
        - Dropped support for Python 2.5.
        
        0.10 (2012-11-22)
        -----------------
        
        - Set default transfer encoding for attachments to ``base64`` and allow
          an optional ``transfer_encoding`` argument for attachments. This currently
          supports ``base64`` or ``quoted-printable``.
        
        - Properly handle ``Mailer.from_settings`` boolean options including ``tls``
          and ``ssl``.
        
        - Support ``setup.py dev`` (installs testing dependencies).
        
        - Use ``setup.py dev`` in tox.ini.
        
        0.9 (2012-05-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a test for uncode encoding in multipart messages.
        
        - Depend on ``repoze.sendmail`` >= 3.2 (fixes unicode multipart message
          encoding).
        
        0.8 (2012-03-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Work around a Python 3.2.0 bug in handling emails with empty headers.  This
          allows cc-only and bcc-only emails to be handled properly on all platforms
          (no recipient= required anymore).  See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_mailer/issues/14.
        
        0.7 (2012-03-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Packaging release
        
        0.6 (2012-03-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and pypy compatibility.
        
        - Remove explicit Jython support.  It may work, but we no longer test it
          using automated testing.
        
        - Requires repoze.sendmail 3.0+.
        
        - More descriptive exception raised when attempting to send cc-only or
          bcc-only messages.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_mailer/issues/14
        
        0.6 (2012-01-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Use ',' as an email header field separator rather than ';' when multiple
          values are in the same header (as per RFC822).
        
        - Allow lists of recipient emails to be tuples or lists (previously it was
          just lists).
        
        - Don't include ``Bcc`` header in mail messages (breaks secrecy of BCC).
          See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_mailer/pull/10
        
        0.5.1 (2011-11-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug where the mailer was only sending email to addresses in
          the "TO" field.
        
        0.5 (2011-10-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Drop Lamson dependency by copying Lamson's MailResponse and dependent code
          into ``pyramid_mailer.response``.
        
        0.4.X
        -----
        
        - ``pyramid_mailer.includeme`` function added for
          ``config.include('pyramid_mailer')`` support
        
        - ``pyramid_mailer.testing`` module added for
          ``config.include('pyramid_mailer.testing')`` support.
        
        - ``pyramid_mailer.get_mailer`` API added (see docs).
        
        - ``pyramid_mailer.interfaces`` module readded (with marker IMailer interface
          for ZCA registration).
        
        - ``setup.cfg`` added with coverage parameters to allow for ``setup.py
          nosetests --with-coverage``.
