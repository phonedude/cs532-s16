Product Description

   In 1959, affluent businessman Michael Courtland (Cliff Roberston) and
   his wife (Geneviève Bujold) are celebrating their tenth anniversary
   when his daughter and wife are kidnapped and held for ransom. The
   effort to rescue the girl and her mother ends tragically, and Courtland
   merely exists, his days consumed with guilt. Many years later, still
   grieving over his loss, he returns to Florence - the city where he
   first met his wife - where he meets a young woman who bears a
   remarkable resemblance to her. Set largely in New Orleans, this
   incredibly atmospheric thriller has a southern gothic feel with its
   dreamlike photography (by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond) and
   deliberate pacing. Often compared to Hitchcock’s Vertigo because of its
   protagonist’s obsessive attempt to recreate his lost love and the score
   by the incomparable Bernard Herrmann, director Brian De Palma’s
   (Scarface, The Untouchables) undeniable obsession with cinema results
   in a thrilling approach to a hauntingly familiar

Amazon.com

   Though he had made comedies with Robert De Niro (Hi Mom, Greetings!), a
   horror movie (Sisters), and a rock musical (Phantom of the Paradise),
   it wasn't until this 1976 film that Brian De Palma truly announced
   himself as the heir to Alfred Hitchcock. Written by Paul Schrader, this
   film is an homage to Vertigo, with its own stylish twists and turns.
   Cliff Robertson plays a businessman who, while traveling in Italy,
   meets a young woman (Genevieve Bujold) who is a dead ringer for his
   late wife, who had been killed in a kidnapping years earlier. As he
   woos and wins her, the vibes get creepier and creepier because, well,
   something's not right about this woman. Interestingly, this film came
   out the same year as De Palma's Carrie, a much more successful movie at
   the box office. But it was this movie that, for all its flaws,
   proclaimed De Palma as a stylist with a sure-handed command of visual
   storytelling. --Marshall Fine

   [128]5.0 out of 5 stars[129]PALI(-N)MPS(-C)EST
   By [130]Daniel S. on April 10, 2002
   Format: DVD
   Based on a very smart screenplay directly written for the screen by
   Paul Schrader and Brian De Palma, OBSESSION is, in my opinion, the
   masterpiece of the director of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. The movie can be
   read at several different levels but is primarily an excellent thriller
   treating of the guiltiness felt by a man who failed to rescue his wife
   and his daughter when kidnapped in New orleans.
   The key of OBSESSION lies in the scene of the first encounter between
   Courtland and Sandra, in the medieval church in which the hero married
   his first wife. Sandra is trying to restore old paintings that happen
   to have been themselves painted over older paintings. Asked by
   Courtland if the new paintings will be erased, Sandra answers that it's
   not useful to destroy them in order to bring into light the original
   ones.
   So OBSESSION is clearly an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO but is
   also a movie of its own who deserves credit. I remember that the
   sumptuous travellings of De Palma's camera were, in the seventies,
   rather unusual in the american production and generated numerous
   critics. One can only observe, 25 years later, that De Palma new
   aesthetics has inspired a whole generation of american filmmakers, like
   Steven Spielberg for instance, who has understood that a camera
   movement could produce emotions in the viewer's heart.
   Among the bonus features of this DVD, there is a very interesting
   featurette with recent interviews of the cast.

   [135]5.0 out of 5 stars[136]Timeless classic mystery, suspense, noir!
   By [137]R. A. Bean on February 18, 2007
   Format: DVD Verified Purchase
   A lot of people dislike DePalma because once they've seen his films,
   then go back for a second viewing, they realize just how well he fooled
   them, the whole time displaying any clues possible right before their
   very eyes; hence, making them feel stupid. That is one of the qualities
   I love about his films. For once you've seen it, then go back and view
   it again with the knowledge you have of the overall film, letting all
   of the hints and OBVIOUS clues that are placed right before your very
   eyes the entire time; yet, when the movie was over, you felt like a rug
   just got pulled right out from beneath you.
   And a LOT of people point out the "Hitchcock" touch his films seem to
   have, which they do...to a degree. What a lot of people don't seem to
   realize is that DePalma was also a student of the French Cineme Nuavue,
   artists like Godard, Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, and Lelouch. Yes,
   this film is admittedly (by DePalma - he said that he and friend,
   writer Paul Schrader had just seen "Vertigo" and loved the idea so much
   that it inspired this screenplay) inspired by Hitchcock's "Vertigo", if
   anyone out there has ever seen Claude Lelouch's French 1966 masterpiece
   "A Man And A Woman" they will know what I'm talking about in reference
   to all of the OTHER great artists of film that inspired DePalma's
   style, decision, precision, and delivery.
   Not to give any kind of spoiler, but the climatic ending that swirls
   into a freeze frame is straight from the ending of Lelouch's brilliant
   film "A Man And A Woman", and SO appropriately so, seeing that this
   film has such a romantic tone throughout it, even during the most
   suspenseful of scenes, the style of filming it is so romantic (I don't
   mean a love story, but in tone).[138]Read more ›

   [143]5.0 out of 5 stars[144]NOISSESBO
   By [145]Mr. Sean A. Mccabe on August 8, 2001
   Format: DVD
   Another excellent De Palma thriller, this time without the sex and
   violence. Even if you don't like his other movies like BODY DOUBLE, if
   you want an interesting and atmospheric thriller, get this. It is a
   much more subtle film some of ones that followed, partly a love story,
   partly a mystery and all class. I won't explain the story as it has
   already been explained here and elsewhere a million times, so on to the
   DVD.
   The picture is a bit grainy(some parts look better than others), but
   although I hadn't seen the film before I have read that it has always
   looked grainy and washed out ever since it was first released. Still
   apart from the grain the picture is still sharp. You get 5.1, 2 channel
   and mono english sound tracks and they sounded good to me.
   Also included on the disc is an excellent 35 minute documentary and a
   trailer(plus trailers of two other films).

   [150]5.0 out of 5 stars[151]DePalma - The Greatest of the Film School
   Brats
   By [152]tashcrash on May 24, 2001
   Format: DVD
   Brian DePalma directed a string of truly inspired films in the 1970s,
   from SISTERS to CARRIE, from the campy, baroque glam of PHANTOM OF THE
   PARADISE, to the decade-ending double shots of DRESSED TO KILL and BLOW
   OUT. In the middle, he directed OBSESSION, which upped the ante of
   perversity, beauty and lurid unpleasantness of Hitchcock's VERTIGO
   (with a dash of DIAL 'M' for good measure). What people dismiss as
   second-hand aping, I see as respectful homage, an updating of
   Hitchcock's perspective for the post-Vietnam, post-Beatles age. He was,
   after all, one of the leaders of the "film school brats" of the late
   1960s (all members of which blatantly copied the masters of the
   previous generation), and, to my mind, was the most brilliant (at least
   technically), the most mature, and the most sensitive of his peers.
   Give me the twisted emotional and visual depths of OBSESSION over a
   malfunctioning mechanical shark or a juvenile "creature cantina" any
   day!

   [157]4.0 out of 5 stars[158]An overlooked gem
   By [159]Gold Coast Glenn on January 16, 2007
   Format: DVD
   OBSESSION is a great film, and even stands the test of time after 32
   years!
   I first saw this film in 1975 upon it's release. It had an enormous
   impact on me, perhaps as I was a lot younger then, but it stayed with
   me for many years. It was great to see it again after all this time,
   and it stands up very well indeed, unlike a lot of films from the 70's
   and 80's.
   Its essentially a homage to Hitchcock, it has many similar structures,
   plot twists and very clever photography. You may guess what's going on
   if you are a a seasoned movie viewer, but the journey is lots of fun,
   with some great characters and performances along the way.
   Brian De Palma is a fascinating director, and this is a far better film
   than the later production and Kirk Douglas vehicle THE FURY, which,
   whilst it is suspenseful, its just not in the same league. OBSESSION
   was De Palma's first widescreen production.
   Filmed deliberately in soft focus to mask and assist the passage of 15
   years (as explained in the excellent 2000 production documentary on the
   disc), the picture quality loses a little, even in the fully restored
   version on this release, but the wonderful score by Bernhard Herrmann
   is a real pleasure along with the terrific 5.1 Dolby mix. In the doco
   it's great to see interviews with both Cliff Robertson and Genevieve
   Bujold, but John Lithgow is overlooked, or perhaps would not be
   involved. A pity, as he has a pivotal role in the film and is a great
   Faustian character.
   Some of the film is shot at the San Miniato church in Florence, it's a
   beautiful place, and well worth a visit.
   I recommend this one to film fans, a real pleasure.
