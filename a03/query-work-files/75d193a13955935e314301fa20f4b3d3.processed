Buy The Third Jihad

   United States internal security forces are grappling with the growing
   issue of homegrown terrorism. In large part, the threat stems from the
   growing Islamist ideology which rejects the notions of tolerance and
   inclusion and in its stead promotes jihad - the religious duty of
   Muslims to engage in a Holy War against infidels. This film explores
   the issue of both violent and cultural Jihad in the U.S., today.
